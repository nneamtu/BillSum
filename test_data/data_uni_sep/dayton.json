General GuidelinesIn general, the cost of transportation, accommodations, and other business travel or entertainment related expenses should be governed by what is reasonable and appropriate to the purpose involved.\u00a0 Conscientious use and good stewardship of University funds is the responsibility of the individual to ensure the University uses its\u2019 funds in accordance with University objectives and ideals.Colleges, schools or departments may offer more stringent guidelines to which personnel should adhere, such as pre-approval or budgetary considerations. There are times when a department will reimburse an employee only a fixed amount, with any expenses incurred beyond this amount becoming the responsibility of the individual. This arrangement is acceptable at the University as long as both the departmental supervisor and the employee traveling or entertaining have a mutual agreement concerning this arrangement. An individual who travels or entertains under this type of agreement is only required to report the amounts spent up to the agreed upon fixed reimbursed amount.Student organizations that utilize University funds in any capacity (i.e. solely University funded or a combination of University funds and personal funds) are required to follow the University of Dayton Travel and Entertainment Procedures.It is impossible for this policy to cover every possible situation an individual might experience. Items of an unusual nature may be discussed with members of the Purchasing Office before submission.\u00a0 Vice Presidents and\/or Deans can make exceptions to this policy in the event of extenuating circumstances; however, even if approved, these exceptions can result in taxable reimbursement.\u00a0 Any exception situation should include a written explanation and approval with the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report submission.Habitual abusers of this policy, including those who repeatedly obtain prepayments of unused expenses, may result in such expenses being treated as if they were paid under a non-accountable plan and therefore as compensation, subject to the required payroll tax withholdings and reported as taxable income on the employee\u2019s Form W-2.\u00a0Accountable PlanThe University of Dayton\u2019s Policy for University Business Travel and Entertainment is considered an \u201caccountable plan\u201d per Internal Revenue Service definitions.\u00a0 Expense reimbursements that meet accountable plan rules are not reported as income to the individual.\u00a0 Under Internal Revenue Service accountable plan rules, travel advances and reimbursement of expenses must meet three requirements:\nExpenses reimbursed must be for University related business.\u00a0 Travel advances must be reasonably related to the cash business expenses expected to be incurred. Expenses must not be ones that would have otherwise been paid by the employee in the absence of business travel.\nExpenses must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAny advance amounts in excess of substantiated expenses (unused money from advances) must be returned to the University within a reasonable period of time.\u00a0\nReasonable TimeAny individual seeking reimbursement of University funds for business related travel or entertainment must submit their request to the Office of Student Accounts:\nWithin 60 days of the conclusion of the travel or date of entertainment; and\nExpenses must be well documented with all required receipts attached to the University\u2019s Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report.\u00a0\nFailure to substantiate expenses and\/or clear advances within 60 days of the conclusion of travel or date of entertainment generally will result in amounts to be treated as if they were paid under a non-accountable plan and treated as compensation, subject to the required payroll tax withholdings and reported as taxable income on the employee\u2019s Form W-2.\u00a0 Any special circumstances should be noted on the reimbursement request and will be reviewed on a per case basis.IRS RequirementsIn order to reimburse employee business expenses on a tax-free basis, federal tax rules and Internal Revenue Service audit requirements must be followed.\u00a0 These rules govern the University\u2019s requirements regarding employee business expense reimbursements.\u00a0 Modifications in tax rules of Internal Revenue Service requirements will occasionally necessitate changes in definitions or documentation requirements and the taxability of items that do not conform to the new definition or requirements. On occasion, this policy many indicate that certain items must be treated as taxable income, meaning that the University must include certain reimbursements in the employee\u2019s compensation, subject to required payroll tax withholdings, and reported on the employee\u2019s W-2.\u00a0How to Request a Travel and\/or Entertainment Reimbursement1. \u00a0Complete the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report (link here).\u00a0 This form must be completed in full with the following information:\nIndividual Name\nUniversity ID\nDates and Location of Travel and\/or Entertainment\nDepartment\nFund & Account Charged\nUniversity Business Purpose\n\u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to the above items, entertainment expenses must also include the following information:\nIdentification of the persons or group being entertained; and\nStatement explaining the reason for such entertainment, the benefit of such entertainment to the University, and to clarify the relationship of the persons attending to the University\u2019s programs or activities.\n2. \u00a0Attached original, detailed receipts for all single transaction expenses over $20.\nAll charges must be submitted in U.S. Dollars.

TransportationAs a general rule, individuals will be expected to utilize a mode of transportation that will result in the most efficient and cost-effective University related business travel. This rule applies to transportation to the individual's destination (e.g., plane, private automobile, etc.) and to the type of service utilized at the visiting location (e.g., car rental, limousine, taxi, car service, etc.). It is often more economical and convenient to use taxis and car services (e.g. Uber) than to pay for car rental and parking. In the event a traveler wishes to travel in a manner not deemed to be the most cost effective, the traveler will be reimbursed only up to the amount of the most cost effective method.\u00a0 Documentation of such costs must be provided along with the request for reimbursement.\u00a0 Travelers should contact the Purchasing office at 937-229-2641 for more information prior to electing this option.Any employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use this card for transportation fees unless using Altour.Commercial Air TravelAirline tickets may be charged directly to the University through the travel agency, Altour Travel or may be self-booked by the traveler. Any employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use the card for all travel-related fees.\nClass of Travel:\u00a0 Commercial air travel expense is reimbursed on the basis of actual costs incurred by the traveler. Every effort should be made to book travel that is the most efficient and economical.\u00a0 Travelers should attempt to make reservations at least 14 days prior to the scheduled trip departure in order to take advantage of discounted rates. Economy\/Coach fares are the only classes of travel that will be reimbursed. If the traveler wishes to maximize comfort and convenience for domestic travel (i.e., utilize Business Class, First Class, or preferred\/upgraded seat fees), the traveler will designate the difference as personal and should deduct these charges from any other amounts due to the traveler.\nIn order to be reimbursed for an upgraded seat on a flight, the outbound flight time must be 14 hours or more.\u00a0 Under certain medical circumstances for flights less than 14 hours, such upgrades or fees may be reimbursed with appropriate approval. In addition, those required to travel extensively or internationally for their University position, may be allowed reimbursement of these charges in certain instances. Appropriate documentation and rationale for such charges must be submitted to the University.\nBaggage:\u00a0 The University will reimburse reasonable expenses associated with baggage handling (i.e. the number of pieces of luggage should be commensurate with the duration or purpose of the trip).\nFrequent Flyer Programs:\u00a0 The University will not reimburse travelers for tickets purchased with frequent flyer miles, only out of pocket costs of tickets will be reimbursed. Accumulated awards remain the property of the traveler; however, if a traveler arranges a more expensive flight solely based on a Frequent Flyer program, the traveler is responsible for the difference in cost. Frequent Flyer bonus awards should not be the deciding factor when selecting flights, but are permitted to be used to purchase upgrades or charges that might not otherwise be reimbursed by the University.\nFly America Act:\u00a0Travelers under sponsored research funding must comply with the Fly America Act which requires travelers to use:\n\u00a0 \u00a0A U.S. flag air carrier; or\n\u00a0 \u00a0A foreign carrier that operates under a U.S. Flag air carrier code-sharing agreement and identifies the U.S. flag air carrier\u2019s designator\u2019s code and flight number.\nUniversity employees will not be reimbursed any travel costs associated with the piloting of their own, borrowed, or leased aircraft when on University related business.\u00a0 The expenses related to chartering an aircraft may be allowable with the appropriate signature authority.Non-Allowable\/Non-reimbursable items\nAirline Life Insurance or any additional travel insurance premiums\nAir travel club memberships\nPersonal entertainment (movies, sporting events, etc.)\nChanges, Cancellations or Unused Airline TicketsPenalties and charges resulting from the cancellation of airline reservations shall be the University's obligation if the individual's travel has been approved in advance and the cancellation or change is made at the direction of and for the convenience of the University.Changes in travel itineraries can be frequent because of the nature of business travel. If there is a change in itinerary before a trip has commenced, the place of purchase must be contacted for a new ticket if time permits. The passenger receipt should be attached to the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report, indicating which expenses were returned for credit. If a refund is not issued, the traveler\u2019s department is responsible for tracking the proper use of future flight credits granted. If the airline ticket is reissued at the airport, make sure to retain the ticket receipt of the original ticket and document any adjustments in the fare. Travel arrangements made through Altour will be handled and tracked by Altour for processing any credits for unused airline tickets.\u00a0Airport ParkingTravelers are expected to park in the most economical airport parking lot when traveling on University business. Reimbursements requested in excess of the most economical parking, without a valid University reason and supervisor approval, will be reimbursed at a maximum rate of $15\/day, with the traveler responsible for the difference in cost.\u00a0At Dayton International Airport, University of Dayton employees will be reimbursed in full when using the negotiated discount at Park-N-Go for 15% off full service valet parking in lieu of parking in the economy lot.\u00a0 In order to utilize this discount, simply complete your profile online at https:\/\/www.daytonparking.com\/corporate\/?code=AUD15 which will apply the 15% discount off the standard rate.Car Rental (link to website information)The use of a rental car must be justified as a business necessity. When renting a car, fuel costs will be reimbursed based upon actual fuel purchased. Any employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use this card for all rental vehicle fees. In addition, all employees who rent a vehicle on University business or seek reimbursement of mileage expenses are expected to become a University Certified Driver. Information on to how to become a Certified Driver can be found here.The University has a preferred vendor relationship with Enterprise\/National Car Rental (link to program summary).

Any larger sized vehicle must be justified by a University business purpose and approved by the supervisor.\nDomestic Travel:\n\u00a0 When using contract XZ38Y40 at Enterprise or National, collision damage insurance (sometimes referred to as CDW or LDW), personal accident insurance (PAI), and liability insurance supplement (LIS) should be declined when traveling within the United States because the University has this coverage provided for all employees who use rental cars for domestic travel. If elected, such insurance is not reimbursable.\n\u00a0 If not using contract XZ38Y40 at Enterprise or National, driver must obtain the collision damage insurance.\nInternational Travel: Collision damage insurance (sometimes referred to as CDW or LDW), personal accident insurance (PAI), and liability insurance supplement (LIS) should be elected when traveling in a country outside the United States and is reimbursable.\nIndividuals who are not employees or students at the University of Dayton are not covered by the University\u2019s automobile liability insurance. Since many credit cards provide automobile insurance coverage, these individuals should check with their personal credit card to determine the coverage for which they are eligible.\nReimbursement of gas is appropriate on rental vehicles (mileage is allowable for rentals).\u00a0 However, failure to return a rental vehicle with a full gas tank, usually results in excessive gas charges.\u00a0 The University will not reimburse excessive gas charges for a failure to return the rental vehicle with a full gas tank.\u00a0 (If a reimbursement request is received with excessive gas charges, the University will reimburse a maximum of $3.50\/gallon with the individual responsible for the remainder cost.)Inspect all vehicles before driving and make sure all dents, scratches or other damage to the vehicle is noted on the rental form.RENTAL VEHICLE ACCIDENTS\nImmediately call local law enforcement to file the appropriate police and rental company reports.\nCall the \"800\" number on the back of the rental agreement to report. If needed, they will notify a tow truck and process your replacement vehicle. \u200b\nWithin 24 hours, call University Risk Management at 937-229-4503 to report the accident and\/or damage.\nNon-Allowable\/Non-reimbursable items\nRental Car Insurance detailed above \n\nCDW (damage waiver),\nDW (damage waiver),\u00a0\nPAI\/PEC (personal accident insurance\/personal effects coverage),\nPAE (personal accident and effects protection),\nSLP (supplemental liability)\n\n\nPersonal VehicleUsage of a personal vehicle will be reimbursed at a maximum of the current mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service (link here). All employees who use a personal vehicle for University business or seek reimbursement of mileage expenses are expected to become a University Certified Driver. Information on to how to become a Certified Driver can be found here. Individuals should compare the cost of a rental car vs. usage of a personal vehicle.\u00a0 Only mileage resulting from the conduct of University related business is allowed. Mileage for which reimbursement is claimed must reflect the most direct route and be the lesser of the mileage from the University of Dayton Campus or personal residence to the destination.\nFor example, mileage to Dayton International Airport will only be paid at a maximum of 16 miles or less depending on the individual\u2019s personal residence and starting point.\nPersonal mileage must be excluded in determining the mileage for which reimbursement will be made. Claims exceeding mileage computed by the most direct route from the point of departure to destination (because of field visits, picking up passengers, etc.) must be explained on the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report.\nDocumentation of mileage such as MapQuest or Google Maps must be submitted with any request.\u00a0\nDriving vs. FlyingIndividuals electing to use a personal vehicle instead of air travel must fully document the cost savings of mileage versus the flight costs.\u00a0 One should include all necessary travel costs when performing this comparison which would include, for example, airport parking, transportation to\/from hotel, mileage to the airport and parking at the hotel when driving. Flight costs used in the comparison should be obtained at approximately the same time as the conference registration in order to obtain the most appropriate flight costs and should be the lowest fare available. This cost comparison must be documented prior to the commencement of the trip. Under certain personal or medical circumstances, such exceptions may be allowed or reimbursed.If the cost comparison is not completed, a traveler may submit a request for reimbursement for a maximum round trip of 800 miles of personal mileage to cover all transportation related (airfare, parking, taxi, and gasoline) expenses.Dayton Area MileageMiscellaneous expenses such as personal mileage charges for frequent Dayton area travel should be submitted monthly, prior to the end of the following month.

LodgingThe University will reimburse individuals for actual lodging expenses incurred during University related business travel. All lodging claims must be documented by the detailed hotel\/motel receipt and attached to the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report before reimbursement will be made.

The University will not reimburse travelers for the value of free accommodations used for University related business travel.Additional lodging costs, such as Internet charges, meals, etc. charged to the hotel room should be reflected separately, on the appropriate line, on the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report. Fees associated with Internet usage in a hotel room is reimbursable if the access is required for business purposes.Employee lodging may only be charged\/reimbursed for locations in excess of 50 miles from the University of Dayton campus.

Such reviews will include consideration of any meals provided and the applicable GSA per diem rate for the trip in totality.Actual ReceiptsThe University\u2019s preferred method is the submission of actual receipts.\u00a0 If actual expenses are claimed, travelers will be reimbursed for actual and reasonable personal meal expenses documented by original, detailed receipts (i.e. not credit card slips). At a minimum, the name of the payee, date, good\/service provided and amount should appear on the receipt. Any unusual items or special circumstances causing a policy deviation should be fully explained on an attached, signed memorandum and properly approved.TipsTips are allowable and reimbursable for normal services associated with business travel such as meals, room services and taxi service, etc. Tips should be reasonable and any unusual amounts should be explained. Failure to explain any excessive tip will result in the University reimbursing a 20% tip, with the traveler responsible for the difference in cost.Per DiemIn some instances, it can be administratively burdensome to maintain actual cost receipt detail. In lieu of submitting meal receipts, a traveler may, with supervisor approval, claim the established General Services Administration (GSA) rate for domestic locations (link here) and the State Department rate for international locations (link here).\u00a0\u00a0If per diem is to be used, travelers must adhere to the following:\nPer diem must be used for the entire duration of the trip;\nPer diem must not be claimed for any meal already provided (commercial carrier, seminar, conference, etc.);\nTravelers must document the date, time, place and University related business purpose of the trip;\nTravel must include an overnight stay or exceed 12 hours of the day;\nClaim 75% of the daily per diem rate for the first and last day of travel.\nUniversity Travel CardAny employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use this card for all meal expenses when on University related business travel and follow applicable spending guidelines.Travel StatusOnly local meal expenses while in a travel status are allowed or will be reimbursed. Typically, no meal receipts in the home city, except for meal receipts at the home city airport, will be allowed or reimbursed.\u00a0 However, if the meal is in conjunction with a University related business purpose, then such expense is allowable and\/or reimbursable.Flight Travel Status\nBegins a maximum of two hours prior to departure for domestic flights and three hours prior to departure for international flights.\nEnds when the flight has arrived at the airport for both domestic and international flights.\nNon-Flight Travel Status (All Other)\nBegins when traveler leaves home\/office.\nEnds when traveler returns to home\/office.\nNon-Allowable\/Non-reimbursable items\nMeal expenses in addition to breakfast, lunch and dinner (i.e. snacks)\nEntertainmentThe University understands that occasionally it may be proper to entertain other individuals locally in the Dayton area or while traveling. Any expense incurred for University related business, while entertaining, that includes people other than the reporting individual must be recorded on the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report along with all other travel related expenditures but must follow applicable Entertainment Documentation requirements.Entertainment Documentation RequirementsIndividuals will be reimbursed for actual and reasonable entertainment expenses documented by original, detailed receipts (i.e. not credit card slips). A detailed receipt should include, the name of the payee, date, meals\/drinks provided and amount. The Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report must include:\nDetailed receipts for all expenses;\nIdentification of the persons or group being entertained; and\nA statement of the reason for such entertainment, the benefit of such entertainment to the University and to clarify the relationship of persons attending to the University\u2019s programs or activities.\nAny unusual items or special circumstances causing a policy deviation should be fully explained on an attached, signed memorandum and properly approved.Meals when only University Employees are presentTo be considered nontaxable, the meal in question must be considered to be an ordinary and necessary business expense directly related to or associated with the active conduct of University business and infrequent in nature.Examples\nA group of business colleagues meet daily for lunch to discuss bona fide business matters within the University. \u00a0This meal would be considered taxable to the employees present as the event is not infrequent in nature.\nA department chair takes his\/her administrative assistant to lunch at the end of the academic year in appreciation.\u00a0This meal would not be considered taxable to the employees present because it has an University purpose and is infrequent in nature.\nsection 7. Alcoholic BeveragesIn order to limit University liability, attendance must not be mandatory when alcohol is served. However, the University realizes that in some social situations, conducted for University business purposes, alcohol may be served or\u00a0considered as part of a meal or event. If this is in keeping with the occasion, reasonable costs will be reimbursed. As with all business meals, there must be a University related business purpose for the alcoholic beverages.Facilities & Administrative (Indirect) Cost RateIn order to comply with federal government regulations, any expense that includes an alcoholic beverage must be charged to university account 7360 (guest care).\u00a0\u00a0 Failure to properly account for alcoholic beverages purchased while on University related business will negatively affect the University\u2019s indirect cost rate and federal contractual arrangements. This applies to all University travelers whether or not they are directly involved in research.Examples\nYou travel to Chicago and your expenses total $1,000.\u00a0 One of your dinners includes an alcoholic beverage and is $50 of your total travel expenses.\u00a0 When preparing your travel form, the expenses must be allocated as follows:\u00a0 $50 to account 7360 (guest care) and $950 to the appropriate account (i.e. 7870, staff travel).\nYou take a potential donor to dinner and your expenses, which include alcoholic beverages, total $100.\u00a0 When preparing your reimbursement request, the entire meal amount of $100 must be allocated to account 7360 (guest care).\nEntertainment\/Guest CareAlcoholic beverages purchased for entertainment\/guest care when traveling are reimbursable only when the entertainment\/guest care is necessary to accomplish University related business objectives.Any alcoholic beverage expense incurred for University related business that includes people other than the reporting individual must be recorded on the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report and be in accordance with the University\u2019s Entertainment Documentation Requirements (See Section 6).\u00a0Generally, alcohol is not reimbursable or permissible for University of Dayton undergraduate, graduate or law students regardless of the source of funds. It is never permissible to provide alcohol to students who are not of a legal drinking age.section 8. Conferences and Professional MeetingsAny employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use this card for conference and professional meeting registration expenses when on University related business.When attending a conference, travelers may stay at the conference hotel, even though it may not be the most economical option available.If meals are included in the conference fee but the traveler chooses to eat elsewhere, such expenses are not reimbursable. Any exception request to this policy must include a full explanation as to the business purpose.Non-Allowable\/Non-reimbursable items\nOptional conference events (e.g. tours, sporting events, etc.)\nSection 9. Internet\/Phone ChargesDuring travel on University related business, individuals can be reimbursed for certain Internet-related expenses. Generally, in flight Wi-Fi or hotel Wi-Fi will not be allowable or reimbursed unless a valid University related business purpose is provided and approved by a supervisor.Phone Calls\/Hotel Phone UsageIndividuals can be reimbursed for personal cellular phone usage for University related business. See the University of Dayton Policy on Employer-Provided Mobile Communication Devices and Associated Services for instructions regarding these reimbursements.\u00a0Employees are encouraged to use phones other than those in their rooms, if possible, in order to avoid hotel phone charges.\u00a0 In the event a hotel room phone is used, the university related business purpose must be documented.\u00a0 Personal phone calls from a hotel phone must be reasonable in length and frequency, not to exceed ten minutes per day of travel.Non-Allowable\/Non-reimbursable\nAdditional Internet\/Wi-Fi charges at a hotel or in flight without a University related business purpose.\nSection 10. Candidates for EmploymentThe Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report should be used for a person who is a candidate for employment. The University will reimburse the individual incurring the travel expenses of the candidate. If the candidate's spouse\/companion is to accompany the candidate, generally, the spouse\/companion's travel expenses are not reimbursable.Any employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use this card for all candidate expenses when possible.The individual arranging the candidate's visit must inform the candidate of the University Travel Policy, the University Entertainment Policy and all reporting requirements. The individual arranging the trip should consider making arrangements through Altour or using a University Travel Card, giving full consideration to the convenience of the candidate. If the candidate schedules his\/her own travel arrangements, the proper documentation will still be required for reimbursement. Without the proper documentation, the candidate will not be reimbursed. The Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report should be signed by the candidate, if possible. The candidate will never be reimbursed in cash.All expenses are to be charged to sub account 7180 - Candidates for Employment. The individual who arranges for the candidate to interview is responsible for submitting the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report within the required time period.Once an offer of employment has been accepted, travel expenses are considered to be \u201cMoving Expenses.\u201dSection 11. Spousal\/Companion Travel and\/or EntertainmentIn certain circumstances, there may be a justifiable business purpose for an employee\u2019s spouse\/companion to travel, entertain or represent the University at a particular function, and therefore the spouse\/companion\u2019s travel and\/or entertainment expenses may be reimbursed in accordance with this policy.\u00a0 Justification and pre-approval must be documented.If the presence of the spouse\/companion is essential, with a documented business purpose, to the employee\u2019s ability to carry out their responsibilities, there may not be tax consequences to the employee.\u00a0Questions regarding taxability should be directed to the Tax Manager in the Treasurer\u2019s Office.\u00a0\u00a0 In certain cases, it may be desirable for the spouse\/companion to attend a function on behalf of the University without a business purpose. This may require the spouse\/companion\u2019s travel and\/or entertainment expenses to be included in the employee\u2019s taxable wages as a taxable \u201cfringe benefit\u201d and appropriate taxes withheld.\u00a0 In most cases, any spouse\/companion\u2019s travel and\/or entertainment expenses will be the personal responsibility of the employee.ExamplesAllowable - A candidate for employment is interviewing with the University.\u00a0 As part of the interview process, she\/he is accompanied by her\/his spouse\/companion for a dinner with the search committee chair.\u00a0 The search committee chair may be appropriately accompanied by her\/his spouse\/companion at the dinner.Allowable - A faculty member is having dinner with a donor and his\/her spouse\/companion. The faculty member may be appropriately accompanied by her\/his spouse\/companion at the dinner.Not allowable - An employee\u2019s spouse\/companion travels with the employee to a conference where the employee is a presenter and sightsees the area while the employee attends the conference.\u00a0 The spouse\/companion has no documented business purpose. Therefore, none of the spouse\/companion\u2019s travel expenses (meals, lodging, and transportation) will be paid by the University.Section 12. International TravelReimbursement requests for international travel follow the same guidelines as the general travel and entertainment policy. Any employee with a University Travel Card (P-card) is expected to use this card for expenses when on University related international business travel. In addition to airfare, business meals, car rentals, lodging, entertainment, etc., the traveler will be reimbursed for applicable passport\/visa fees related to the University travel, required immunizations, airport taxes, exchange rate fees, and other items necessary for conducting University business in connection with University travel.Conversion RatesAny expense reports must be submitted in U.S. dollars with an explanation and translation of the foreign receipts and their conversions. Travelers must use the currency rates that were in effect on the date the expense was incurred and\/or under one of the three options below:Option 1: Traveler maintains documentation of the conversion rate used when converting US dollars to a foreign\u00a0currency.\u00a0 If this documentation is maintained and submitted with the reimbursement request, the traveler may use this rate for all expenses for this particular trip up to the amount of documented cash converted.Option 2: If the traveler uses a personal credit card during travel, this credit card statement (in addition to the detailed receipts) can be submitted along with the reimbursement request to show the US converted dollars as documentation.\u00a0 If this option is used, please be sure to black out personal information such as credit card number and personal expenses.\u00a0 The conversion rate can be calculated from this statement and used to convert all non-credit card expenditures for this particular trip.\u00a0Option 3: Travelers may use the website www.oanda.com\/currency\/converter\/ to obtain such rates. Click on the type of currency the traveler used, the currency the traveler wants (US Dollar) and change the date to the first date of travel.\u00a0 Enter the amount of the foreign currency and the amount in US dollars will be generated. Please attach a print screen of this rate to the expense report as backup. This conversion rate, once generated, may be used to convert the remainder of the expenditures for this particular trip.Write the converted amount (US dollars) on each receipt as expenditures will be confirmed by a member of the Office of the Treasurer.Whichever method is selected it must be used for the duration of the trip.Travel Registry and Helpful HintsAny University related business trip must be registered on the University of Dayton International Travel Registry. In addition, the University provides guidelines and helpful hints regarding international travel. Anyone traveling on behalf of the University is eligible for the International SOS Travel Assistance Program. Information regarding all of these items can be located at the following link.Information related to Travel Warnings and other assistance available to international travelers can be located at the following link.Any employee traveling with a University provided cell phone must contact the UDit Service Center at 937-229-3888 or helpdesk@udayton.edu regarding international travel prior to the departure date to add the appropriate cellular travel plans and ensure the University is not charged excessive roaming charges. Failure to consult with UDit could result in the traveler liable for excessive phone charges.\u00a0 Employees with personal cell phones should contact their carrier regarding their options regarding international roaming to avoid excessive roaming charges.Section 13. Student Group TravelAll arrangements for student group travel may be paid for using a University Travel Card, through Altour Travel or by each individual self-booking.\u00a0section 14. Travel AdvancesAdvances will only be allowed in limited circumstances.\u00a0If an advance is obtained through the University Travel Card, all ATM receipts, as well as documentation of cash expenditures and their University related business purpose, must be submitted for audit along with the required\u00a0monthly report. Any other advance request must be submitted to the Office of Student Accounts, on a Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report, at least ten (10) business days prior to the scheduled departure date.\u00a0When an individual has received an advance and has funds remaining upon return from a trip, the following steps are required:\nThe remaining funds must be deposited with the Office of Student Accounts;\nDocumentation of each cash expenditure, the University related business purpose, and the teller receipt, must be attached to the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report; and\nThe Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report must be submitted to the Office of Student Accounts within a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days.\nU.S. Dollar cash expenditures can be documented on the following Cash Receipt and Expense Record. (link here) Foreign currency expenditures can be documented on the following International Cash Receipt and Expense Record. (link here)Failure to file the Travel Card monthly report or Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report within a reasonable time will cause a delay in the processing of the reimbursement, and future travel requests, advance requests, or University Travel Card usage may be denied. The University of Dayton is required to report as compensation any advances which are not accounted for by the employee. Once this amount is reported to the Internal Revenue Service, it cannot be reversed when the individual does complete the Travel\/Entertainment Expense Report.Travelers with special needs, such as a large group of students or for international travel where credit cards are not widely accepted should contact the Office of Student Accounts (travel@udayton.edu) for travel advance options.section 15.

The proper management of asbestos-containing materials will help to prevent airborne exposure in University facilities. The University has developed an asbestos management plan that is implemented through Environmental Health & Safety (EHS).Definitions(a) \u201cAsbestos\u201d is a generic term referring to six naturally-occurring fibrous silicate minerals found predominantly in metamorphic rock. Asbestos fibers are very small and may remain airborne for several hours when broken-up and dispersed into the air.(b) \u201cAsbestos-Containing Material\u201d (ACM) means any material containing more than one percent asbestos. Common examples of ACM include, but are not limited to, pipe and boiler insulation, spray-applied fireproofing, troweled-on acoustical plaster, floor tile and mastic, transite materials (shingles, siding, lab tables, hood walls), roofing materials, wall and ceiling plaster, ceiling tiles, and gasket materials.(c) \u201cAsbestos Awareness Training\u201d is provided for employees who conduct asbestos work that is not considered an asbestos project or is excluded from asbestos worker certification.(d) \u201cAsbestos Project\u201d includes the construction, demolition, repair, remodeling, maintenance, or renovation of any public or private building or structure, mechanical piping equipment or system involving the demolition, removal, encapsulation, salvage or disposal of material, or outdoor activity releasing or likely to release asbestos fibers into the air.(e) \u201cPresumed Asbestos-Containing Material\u201d (PACM) means thermal system insulation and surfacing material found in buildings, vessels and vessel sections constructed no later than 1980 that are assumed to contain greater than one percent asbestos but have not been sampled or analyzed to verify or negate the presence of asbestos.PolicyACM shall only be removed or otherwise impacted by a licensed asbestos abatement contractor utilizing licensed workers. ACM or other asbestos-contaminated debris\/waste shall be properly labeled and transported off-site by a licensed waste hauler to a registered landfill where proper manifesting procedures shall be utilized.I. \u00a0All asbestos-related activities will be managed and\/or coordinated through Environmental Health & Safety\/Risk Management (EHS\/RM) for all University-owned property. Practices include but are not limited to:\nDetermine the presence and location of ACM.\nCoordinate, oversee and manage all asbestos projects impacting ACM in University facilities including renovation and demolition.\nManage all asbestos abatement activities.\nProcure the services of licensed asbestos abatement contractors and consultants.\nConduct training to inform, provide knowledge and basic awareness on asbestos issues.\nManage the campus-wide and residential database including survey and abatement with the associated documentation.\nII. \u00a0Any University department or contractor that will be performing work with the potential to disturb suspect asbestos-containing materials in University-owned property shall coordinate work through EHS.\u00a0 EHS shall be provided with the scope of work, including drawings with demolition notes when available, along with the schedule of the project.\u00a0 All information must be submitted to EHS\/RM in a timely manner for coordination and regulatory notification purposes.\u00a0\u00a0III. \u00a0During any project in University-owned property that will involve the disturbance of asbestos-containing materials, the project manager will

Examples include serving as a tourist guide at a University museum or educational facility, working on a University advisory or development committee, or otherwise performing duties that are of benefit to the University\u2019s teaching, research, and\/or public service missions.PolicyI. PolicyIn conducting background checks for various individuals (or having such checks conducted on its behalf), assessing the results of background checks or requiring background checks, it is the University\u2019s policy to comply with all applicable federal and state laws, regulations and guidance.\u00a0Background checks will be conducted for any individual (those under the age of eighteen (18) require parental consent), paid or unpaid, engaged by the University in any service capacity in compliance with the following:\u00a0Background checks will be used to evaluate candidates\u2019 eligibility to be engaged in any work or service capacity by the University, and will not be used to discriminate on the basis of age, race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, sex\/gender, sexual orientation, disability, genetic information, military status, veteran status, familial status or any other protected category under applicable local, state or federal law, ordinance or regulation.Adverse disclosures and\/or findings will not automatically disqualify an individual from employment, employment consideration, or eligibility to be engaged in any work or service capacity by the University. The University will consider the nature and gravity of the offense(s); time since conviction; completion of sentence or any other remediation; relevance to the position for which the candidate is being considered, the position the employee is performing, or the position for which the individual is offering his or her services; and discrepancies between the background check and what the candidate\/employee self-reported.Background checks for employment decisions at the University will be facilitated by the Office of Human Resources or the Department of Public Safety based on the position description, job responsibilities or other service requirements or expectations. \u00a0A successful background check must be completed prior to the first day of work\/engagement with the University in the position identified. Any exceptions to this pre-engagement background check must be approved in consultation with the Office of Human Resources or Department of Public Safety, as applicable.Individuals who undergo background checks do so at their own risk.\u00a0 That is, they may face adverse action should negative information be listed on their results.\u00a0 For example, a current University employee who voluntarily submits to a background check (for purposes of a higher-security job assignment or a particular activity) could face adjustments in his or her University employment should negative information related to job duties be disclosed.\u00a0 A University student who voluntarily assents to a background check could be subjected to a code of conduct proceeding if certain information is obtained during a background investigation. \u00a0Further, any individual who undergoes a background check should be aware that the results may be shared with the University\u2019s Threat Assessment Team, Department of Public Safety or other teams \/ departments that tend to security issues, should such referral be deemed appropriate.\u00a0The University, in its sole discretion, retains the right to require a background check in any and all cases. The minimum process to be followed in conducting background checks is set forth in Appendix B.\u00a0II.\u00a0 Background Checks Conducted by the Office of Human ResourcesUnless a special circumstance identified in Section IV applies, the Office of Human Resources will perform background checks in the following circumstances for the following individuals in compliance with this policy and determine whether the results are acceptable, consistent with the process outlined in Appendix B:A.\u00a0 \u201cStandard\u201d Background Checks1.\u00a0 Prospective EmployeesProspective employees or candidates for employment will be informed that any offer of employment is contingent on a satisfactory background check that will be conducted by a consumer reporting agency for review by the University. \u00a0Candidates for employment who fail to participate fully or who provide inaccurate information in a standard background check may have any offer for employment rescinded. When an offer is rescinded, the candidate may not reapply for any University position until one year has passed since the candidate was notified of the adverse background check information.\u00a0 Candidates may decline to authorize a background check; in such cases, no background check will be performed, but the candidate will not be considered further.\u00a0Executives or administrators hired through an executive search firm or staffing agency must complete either a University background check consistent with position requirements or have confirmation of a background check of the required criteria having been completed by the staffing agency.\u00a0A background check is required for all staff rehires that have been separated for longer than 90 days; the Office of Human Resources will determine whether a \u201cseparation\u201d exists or whether an exception to the general 90-day rule is justified. The Office of the Provost will make such determinations for background checks on faculty members who have been separated and \u201coff contract\u201d from the University for longer than 90 days.2.\u00a0 Unpaid Non-employees and Paid Non-employeesAll paid non-employees (e.g., contractors) must successfully complete a standard background check before performing services on the University of Dayton campus, unless a background check exemption applies. Examples of background check exemptions can be found in Appendix C of this policy. With respect to unpaid non-employees, i.e., volunteers, Level 2 Volunteers (as defined in the Policy on University Volunteers) may be required to successfully complete a standard background check prior to performing services, depending on the services provided.\u00a0 Level 3 Volunteers are required to successfully complete a standard background check prior to providing services. \u00a0Such individuals can fulfill this background check requirement if their employer or agency can verify that they have undergone successful background checks (per the protocol of their respective employer or agency) that meet or exceed the background check standards of the University. \u00a0Such third-party non-employees\u2019 employer or agency must be able to furnish such records upon request. Whether a background check meets or exceeds the standards of the University will be determined by the Office of Legal Affairs in coordination with other University offices, as appropriate.B.\u00a0 \u201cEnhanced\u201d Background ChecksFrom time to time, circumstances may arise on campus that require more information -- such as by additional testing or screening -- than is provided by a Standard Background Check. \u00a0Those circumstances may depend on job description, responsibilities and location; for example, University of Dayton Research Institute personnel working with any government unit may be subject to additional requirements in compliance with the policy and procedure of the host site, government contractor, supervising unit, or University department.\u00a0 Another example is that the University may have a partnership with an entity where University employees or students may work at that entity\u2019s premises, but that entity requires stricter testing for access to its premises.\u00a0 Such circumstances will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the Office of Human Resources and may include the assistance of the Office of Contracts and Grants (particularly for government-related security clearances), all in cooperation with the host site, contractor, unit or department, as may be necessary.III. Background Checks Conducted by the Department of Public SafetyA.\u00a0 Prospective Department of Public Safety EmployeesProspective employees or candidates for employment in the Department of Public Safety will be informed that any offer of employment is contingent on a satisfactory Public Safety Background Check. \u00a0\u00a0The Department of Public Safety will determine whether the background test results are acceptable, consistent with the process outlined in Appendix B.Candidates for employment who fail to participate fully or who provide inaccurate information in a background check may be eliminated from consideration for the position. Candidates may decline to authorize a background check; in such cases, no background check will be performed, but the candidate will not be considered further.B.\u00a0 Authorized Adults\u201cAuthorized Adults,\u201d as defined in the University\u2019s \u201cChildren on Campus and Working with Minors Policy\u201d and who may be University students, employees or non-employees, must undergo a fingerprint-based background check annually if (a)\u00a0they are involved in, will be present at or have access to a University-sponsored program or non-University-sponsored program on campus; (b) the program includes overnight stays for minors; and (c) their obligations, assignments or services for the program include being present during the overnight stay portion of the program (e.g., a camp counselor). Exceptions to this requirement will be considered according to Section IV of the \u201cChildren on Campus and Working with Minors Policy.\u201d Whether adverse results impact the minor\u2019s safety or ability of the Authorized Adult to participate in the program involving minors will be determined by the person in charge of the program in conjunction with the Office of Legal Affairs.\u00a0Persons undergoing fingerprint-based background checks in order to participate in a program involving minors voluntarily undergo such checks and assume the risk and consequences should the results indicate negative information reasonably related to employment duties or student status (e.g., a violation of the University\u2019s Code of Conduct for students). Depending on the results, the person in charge of the program and Office of Legal Affairs may determine to forward certain information to the Office of Human Resources (if the Authorized Adult is a staff employee); the Office of the Provost (if the Authorized Adult is a faculty member); or the Division of Student Development (if the Authorized Adult is a student). \u00a0An Authorized Adult who is a non-employee and can verify that he or she has undergone a successful criminal background check within a year of the program involving minors, where in the discretion of the Office of Legal Affairs that check is comparable to the standard background check or fingerprint-based check conducted by or on behalf of the University, does not need to undergo the fingerprint-based check identified in this section to serve as an overnight chaperone of a University-sponsored or non-University-sponsored program on campus. \u00a0If a non-employee cannot verify such records, then a successful fingerprint-based background check is required in order to become an Authorized Adult.C.\u00a0 Fingerprinting Services for General University NeedsThe Department of Public Safety may also provide fingerprinting or fingerprint-based background check services to qualified individuals within the University community. To utilize the fingerprinting services, one must have (1) a current relationship with the University (including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff members) and (2) a bona fide need for such services related to one\u2019s position with the University (i.e. field placement, state licensure, security clearance verification).\u00a0 The Department of Public Safety reserves the right to determine what constitutes a \u201cbona fide need.\u201d\u00a0 Such results will be delivered to the requesting agency or department, or directly to the individual, depending on the specific circumstance.For more information about Fingerprinting Services please contact the Department of Public Safety via the contact information listed in Appendix A.IV.\u00a0 Special Circumstances and EventsA.\u00a0 Heightened Security Clearance or Recent VerificationFor individuals who have recently been authorized or cleared for a heightened government or other security clearance, the requirements for which meet or exceed those of the University\u2019s Standard background check, a University-initiated background check may still be required at the discretion of the Office of Human Resources and the Department of Public Safety.B.\u00a0 Student ApplicantsAt the discretion of a University admissions office, background checks may be conducted for applicants to undergraduate or graduate programs who self-disclose certain criminal or misdemeanor convictions, to verify information that becomes available to the University, or to assess or gather information specific to a program\u2019s unique requirements.C.\u00a0 Other Unique CircumstancesSituations not addressed elsewhere in this policy may arise where a University department\/unit determines a need to perform background checks for individuals seeking a particular relationship with the department\/unit, and for efficiency or other reasons, that department\/unit may desire to manage the background check process itself.\u00a0 In such circumstances, that University department\/unit may conduct and manage the background check process, so long as it obtains approval for that process from the Office of Legal Affairs with the input of the Office of Human Resources or the Department of Public Safety, depending on the type of background check at issue, and so long as it conducts such process consistent with the minimum process set forth in Appendix B.Appendix A: Contact InfoOffice of Human ResourcesSt. Mary's Hall, Rm 118Dayton, Ohio 45469-1614(937) 229-2541hr@udayton.eduFitz Hall, Rm 1951529 Brown

Process for Background Checks\n1. \u00a0The subject of the background check will be required to complete a consent form authorizing the University, or an entity acting on behalf of the University, to complete the background check process.\n\u00a0\n2. \u00a0The University will provide the subject of any background check access to a copy of his or her background check report upon request, regardless of outcome and without charge to the candidate. \u00a0In cases where information in the background check report will result in an adverse hiring decision, the University will provide a copy of the report to the candidate without his or her request.\n\u00a0\n3. \u00a0When a finding adversely impacts employment eligibility, the candidate will be notified and may be withdrawn from employment consideration.\n\u00a0\n4. \u00a0In cases in which information in a Consumer Report, such as a background check showing criminal convictions affecting the candidate\u2019s ability to perform the specific job in question, will result in an adverse employment decision, the University will provide the candidate with all required notifications pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable law(s).\n\u00a0\n5. \u00a0For background checks conducted by Public Safety for Authorized Adults participating in the overnight-stay component of a program involving minors, if adverse findings result from such a check, Public Safety will immediately send those results to the Office of Legal Affairs.\u00a0 The Office of Legal Affairs in turn will coordinate with the Office of the Provost, the Office of Human Resources or the Division of Student Development, as appropriate, to determine next steps.\u00a0 Adverse results are not to be shared with the manager of the minors program.\nNote:\u00a0 The Hiring Committee for all job searches is expected to call employment references.\u00a0 Additionally, the costs associated with conducting any fingerprint-based background checks required by this policy for \u201cAuthorized Adults\u201d in a program involving minors shall be borne (or assessed, collected or otherwise covered) by the University unit sponsoring the program.This process may be modified upon the agreement of the Office of Human Resources and the Department of Public Safety, in consultation with the Office of Legal Affairs.\u00a0 Minor modifications to process that do not materially jeopardize the fairness or legal rights owed to any individual may be made at the discretion of the Office of Human Resources and the Department of Public Safety.Appendix CBackground check requirement exemptions for paid non-employees include but are not limited to:\nPaid speakers and guest lecturers\nDeliveries such as food, florists, water,

Equipment purchased with grant funds becomes the property of the University after the award ends unless the award explicitly specifies otherwise. While the grant is active, the equipment generally moves with the grant recipient. In the case a grant recipient leaves UD, care must be taken to ensure sensitive data is not inappropriately transferred.As described in UD\u2019s Electronic Use of Confidential Data policy, confidential data should not be stored on personal devices.This policy does not apply to UD\u2019s Research Institute. Given the nature of its contract work, UDRI applies a separate standard. For more information on UDRI specific requirements, please contact the Research Information Technology Office.\u00a0Definitions(a) \"IT Equipment\":\u00a0Equipment supporting office automation or the display, processing, storage, or transfer of data.(b) \"Removable Media\":\u00a0Peripheral storage, either permanent or reusable. The latter category includes, but is not limited to, USB flash drives, CDs\/DVDs, and external hard drives.PolicyAll IT equipment purchased with University of Dayton funds must be returned to UDit when no longer needed or a need to transfer equipment outside of the originating department exists. Equipment procured after June 2009 requires purchase of asset management and recycling riders. All or portions of the work specified in this policy may, after initial collection and processing by UDit, be accomplished by 3rd parties contractually bound to the data sanitization requirements of this policy.UDit Technology Support Services (TSS) will move and\/or dispose of unnecessary IT equipment after appropriate paperwork has been completed. To request an equipment move or disposal:\nPrint and complete the equipment change form located at http:\/\/www.udayton.edu\/udit\/_resources\/documents\/policies\/Equipment_Removal_Form.pdf and keep it with the corresponding equipment.\nCall the UDit Help Desk (937-229-3888) and place an equipment change request. A TSS representative will contact you via phone within two business days to schedule an appointment for equipment removal.\nFunctioning IT equipment will be evaluated for redisposition within the UD community or used for replacement parts. Special dispensation may be made for repurposing equipment outside of UD, but requires approval of Purchasing and UDit.All re-allocated computers and removable media will be cleaned of sensitive data and licensed software before being re-deployed within UD or transferred outside the university for either redisposition or destruction. In cases of intradepartmental transfer, this responsibility falls to that unit\u2019s IT support. Computer hard drives will be erased using software compliant with NIST Special Publication 800-88 standards. In the case this is not possible or not cost effective, hard drives (after removal) and\/or removable media will be physically destroyed.

The scope includes any credit or debit card activities conducted at all University of Dayton locations.This policy also applies to all external organizations contracted by University of Dayton departments, faculty, staff, students, organizations and individuals to provide outsourced services for credit or debit card processing for University of Dayton business.PolicyModifications to our systems, whether planned or unplanned, can impact our ability to securely deliver services on time, on budget, and in good working order. Additionally, legal and industry requirements governing particular classifications of data may dictate controls. This is the case with systems that process credit card information. Changes to Payment Card Industry (PCI) environments must go through a formal change control process (PCI Requirement #6.4). Note that PCI requirements apply to the entire environment, all components involved in processing, storage and transport of data, not simply the servers and POS terminals. In general, for a change, or enhancement, to be approved, a solid business case must be presented that demonstrates the risk and lost opportunities in not making the change are significantly higher than they are for making the change.A formal Request for Change (RFC) will be required under the following circumstances:\nModification to the network infrastructure, security controls, hardware, operating systems, applications, database, files, fields, screens, reports, or any other elements.\nAddition of new elements \u2013 hardware or software - that utilize or extend delivered system functions including data.\nRequests for deviation from central budget including the addition of products, third party products, services, and hardware.\nThe Change Control Board may vary depending on the request. Reviewers will consist of UD\u2019s PCI Program Manager, UDit\u2019s IT Risk Management Officer, UD\u2019s Internal Auditor, and the owner of the system(s) for which the change is being requested.There is not an exact order in which the process should occur. Evaluations and research may occur before or after the request is prepared. The primary objective of the process is to insure that a valid business case has been prepared that demonstrates a return on investment that is greater than the costs and risks associated with the change and that all PCI requirements continue to be met. Persons requesting a change to a PCI environment will submit an RFC form to the Change Control Board. In some very few cases, application of monthly operating system patches or daily antivirus signature update, for example, changes can be considered pre-approved and will not require submission of a formal change request beforehand. However, server database records should still be updated as soon as possible afterwards to reflect the environment\u2019s current status. If there\u2019s any question as to whether a change is nominal enough to be considered a candidate for pre-approval, please contact the PCI Program Manager or UDit\u2019s IT Risk Management Officer. PCI environments will be tested, as required, quarterly and upon completion of approved changes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The Change Control Board will provide a written decision or request for additional information.

All University employment policies, practices and procedures are administered in a manner consistent with our Catholic and Marianist identity.In pursuance of this policy the University reaffirms its commitment to an Equal Employment and Affirmative Action Program consisting of three basic goals:\nThe analysis of current practices and policies and the adoption of new or revised practices and policies when necessary to ensure the establishment of effective and specific objectives and procedures for equalizing opportunities in each employment unit.\nThe elimination of any practice and the correction of any individual inequity that may discriminate toward minority groups, women, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans.\nThe intensified recruitment and consideration of minority group members and women to ensure that candidates and employees with appropriate qualifications, potential, and responsibilities are afforded equal opportunity for selection, training, and promotion, and will be compensated without discrimination due to race, sex, disability, veteran status, or any other illegal discrimination ground.\nIt must also be recognized that as a federal government contractor, the University must have an Affirmative Action Program that is acceptable to the appropriate federal agencies. This program not only monitors hiring policies to ensure equal employment but also acts as a vehicle for determining any deficiencies in the area of employment. In addition, those subcontractors hired by the University are bound by these same regulations.While more specifically stated in the above policy these goals are inherent in the governing documents of the University, which affirm the living traditions of Catholicism and the Society of Mary. It follows then, that each individual having the authority to make recommendations for the appointment and promotion of academic, administrative, and staff positions is charged, both ethically and legally, with the responsibility of assisting in placing qualified members of minority groups and women in the mainstream of University employment.By rising to the challenge of this Affirmative Action and University Employment Policy the University is responding to the intent and spirit of its tradition and beliefs.Affirmative Action for Persons with Disabilities and Protected VeteransAs a federal government contractor with contracts in excess of $10,000, the University of Dayton complies with Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, as well as various Ohio laws and does not discriminate against individuals with disabilities and veterans.The University takes affirmative action to employ and advance persons in the above categories and includes an Affirmative Action clause covering these individuals in every contract.The University of Dayton prohibits unlawful discrimination against a qualified employee or applicant on the basis of a disability or veteran status and will take affirmative action to employ, promote, and otherwise treat in a nondiscriminatory manner all qualified individuals in employment practices, including but not limited to hiring, promoting, demoting, transferring, recruiting, advertising, terminating and compensating.The University invites employees with disabilities and\/or veterans to self-identify so that they may be included in the Affirmative Action Plan. This can be done by informing the Office of Human Resources at any time. This information may also assist the University in placing employees in appropriate positions and making accommodations for disabilities.Individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans can assist the University by stating (1) any special methods, skills and procedures which qualify them for positions that they might not otherwise be able to do because of a disability and (2) the reasonable accommodations the University could make which would enable them to perform the essential functions of the job, including special equipment, changes in the physical layout of the job, the modification of nonessential duties relating to the job, or other reasonable accommodations as required by law.

To recognize superior leadership or achievement in a chosen field of endeavor or in the face of extraordinary circumstances;2. To acknowledge a selfless spirit of service that has contributed significantly to improving the world, the Church, the Miami Valley, or the individual's particular community;3. To express appreciation for exceptional generosity that has advanced the Vision of the University of Dayton to be a national leader in Catholic higher education; or4. To publicly identify and recognize worthy role models for students, faculty, alumni, and the community to emulate in their own lives.The recipients of honorary degrees, although chosen for any of the reasons listed above, must exemplify the Catholic and Marianist traditions of leadership and service.\u00a0 They have been determined to be living role models, working tirelessly for the good of fellow human beings.\u00a0\u00a0 The University uses the bestowing of honorary degrees to demonstrate and reinforce the importance of taking an active role in community leadership and service.\u00a0Honorary degrees are typically awarded at major University events and ceremonies including convocations, symposia, public lectures and commencements. Relating the experiences of honorary degree recipients to graduating students serves as a capstone to the University\u2019s efforts to develop in students the knowledge, skills, motivation, and religious and moral convictions that will compel them to join others in addressing critical issues facing our society.NOMINATION PROCEDURE:Honorary degrees are awarded by the Board of Trustees upon recommendation of the President.\u00a0 The President appoints a standing committee that will serve at his discretion and will provide him with advice relative to the selection of such recipients.\u00a0\u00a0The Honorary Degree CommitteeThe Honorary Degree Committee is comprised of representatives of the faculty, students, alumni, Marianist Community, and administration.\u00a0 Membership on the Honorary Degree Committee usually runs for a period of three years, with renewal at the discretion of the President. A committee Chair is appointed by the President from among the committee members.The President is an ex-officio member of the committee.\u00a0 The Vice President for University Advancement or his\/her designee serves on the committee as the President's designee, assisting the committee in its deliberations and in any other way necessary.The committee solicits nominations for honorary degrees from the entire University community.\u00a0 Nominees usually are not persons actively engaged at the University in full time, contractual, or salaried positions or currently members of University Boards, Councils, or Committees.\u00a0 They may be local, national, or international, according to the guidelines in the following section.The committee conducts its meetings as needed and makes its suggestions to the President one year prior to awarding the degree.\u00a0 Because the committee's work is advisory in nature, the deliberations of the committee will remain confidential and reported only to the President.The President and the Board of TrusteesThe President receives the report of the Honorary Degree Committee.The President confers with the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees about the nominees.\u00a0 In addition to those submitted by the Honorary Degree Committee, nominations can be made by the President and members of the Board of Trustees, independent of the committee\u2019s recommendations.After consulting with the Executive Committee, the President makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees.\u00a0 The Board makes the final decisions on the awarding of honorary degrees.President\u2019s Office StaffThe President's office staff handles all the hosting details of the honorary degree process, sending the invitations to the nominees, collecting the citations, and organizing the ceremonies at which the degrees are awarded.\u00a0 Members of the Honorary Degree Committee may be asked to assist in this process.GUIDELINES FOR CONFERRING HONORARY DEGREES:Prospective recipients of honorary degrees can be classified many ways: leaders in their respective fields, nationally-recognized persons, former elected officials, philanthropists, outstanding organizational leaders, distinguished alumni, dedicated servants to the University, and others.\u00a0 The rationale for recognizing an individual with an honorary degree as listed in the \u201cPurpose\u201d section should always be kept in mind when nominating honorary degree candidates.\u00a0 However, we must also recognize that the University\u2019s standard procedure for bestowing honorary degrees may not always be appropriate, depending on the stature of the recipient.\u00a0In general, these guidelines should be followed for various classifications of honorary degree recipients:Nationally-recognized persons - Recipients who are nationally known persons, former elected officials, and\/or recognized leaders in their fields generally prefer to use occasions such as this as an opportunity to make a public address.\u00a0 Because the University has chosen to focus their commencement ceremonies on the graduates rather than on speeches, recipients of honorary degrees bestowed at commencement ceremonies do not have that option.As an alternative, honorary degree recipients who are recognized national leaders should receive their degrees in a separate ceremony, perhaps tied to a significant event at the University or in the recipient\u2019s field, or in conjunction with a University function \u00a0(e.g., the Distinguished Speaker Series).\u00a0 This will enable them to make a public address and perhaps reach a broader audience than if the degree were conferred at commencement.\u00a0Although the cost, in both money and effort, of such an event should not be taken lightly, conferring honorary degrees to these types of individuals in a special ceremony will both ensure their acceptance of the honor and focus some national attention on the University of Dayton.Outstanding Organizational Leaders - Honorary degree recipients who are chosen as a result of the contributions they and their organizations have made to the University of Dayton and\/or their communities should be recognized in a way that brings appropriate recognition to both.\u00a0 As with national leaders, this may be difficult to accomplish if the degree is given at commencement exercises, so perhaps a separate ceremony is most appropriate in these cases.\u00a0 An effort should be made to tie the awarding of the degree to a special event at the University or at the recipient\u2019s organization.Philanthropists, Distinguished Alumni, Dedicated Servants to the University - For most of these honorees, bestowing their degree at commencement exercises is very appropriate.\u00a0 However, there will be some individuals for whom it will be more meaningful to confer their degrees at a special event, such as a ribbon-cutting for a University facility.\u00a0Reference Documents\n\nCode of Regulations of University of Dayton Section 7 (j)\n\n\nUniversity of Dayton300 College ParkDayton, OH 45469937-229-1000info@udayton.eduhttps:\/\/udayton.eduRequest InfoVisitApplyContactDirectionsAlumniCareersBookstorefacebooktwitteryoutubeinstagramlinkedinPorchesPoliciesReport a ConcernPrivacy & TermsNondiscriminationDiversity\n\n\n","summary":"The University of Dayton chooses to recognize and honor individuals of extraordinary achievement, distinguished service, or exemplary character by awarding honorary doctorate degrees appropriate to their accomplishments.

Maintenance of Policy:\u00a0Office of Legal Affairs, Office of Human Resources, and Office of the ProvostDefinitions(a) \u201cVolunteer\u201d (also known as an \u201caffiliate\u201d in certain areas of campus) is an unpaid non-employee who, of his or her own volition, performs services for the University of Dayton, where such services are of mutual benefit and related to the business of the University, meant to support official University activities, or intended to provide experience in a specific area, and where such service is offered and performed with no expectation of compensation in any form.\u00a0 A volunteer is an individual who is not currently enrolled as a student or employed by the University as faculty, staff or a student employee, as those individuals are already subject to the University\u2019s Code of Conduct and other applicable policies. For purposes of this policy, \u201cvolunteer\u201d does not include members of the Board of Trustees who are solely serving the University as a trustee, as trustees are already subject to a Code of Business Conduct\/Conflict of Interest Policy and other expectations set forth in the University\u2019s governing documents.(b) \u201cAdditional Preconditions\u201d (\u201cpreconditions\u201d) require a volunteer whose service is above a Level 1 (see Section I) to satisfy additional requirements prior to service, dependent upon the nature of the service to be provided. Such requirements or preconditions, as determined by a University Representative, and may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: reviewing policies and procedures, visiting\/working in a laboratory, signing a confidentiality agreement, completing driver certification, background check, signing the volunteer agreement, providing signed documentation of receiving the health and safety\u00a0program and questionnaire, signing a waiver or University terms and conditions, etc.Level 2 and 3 volunteers are required to sign the University of Dayton Volunteer Agreement.(c) \u201cUniversity Representative\u201d \u2013 For purposes of this policy, a University Representative is a University of Dayton employee who engages with a potential volunteer regarding the volunteer\u2019s performance of services. University representatives are responsible for determining a volunteer\u2019s level classification and additional preconditions as needed, as well as ensuring all necessary preconditions are satisfied prior to a volunteer\u2019s service.PolicyThe University may accept the services of a volunteer, provided the terms of this policy are met.\u00a0 In its sole discretion, the University may refuse, decline or discontinue the services of a volunteer for nondiscriminatory reasons.Before an individual performs services for the University as a volunteer, a University representative must designate the volunteer\u2019s level of service. Most volunteers performing services for the University will be classified as Level 1 volunteers; Level 1 volunteers are subject to this policy, but are not expected to complete any additional preconditions prior to performing services. Additional preconditions are required for volunteers that exceed the ordinary range of duties, i.e., beyond minimal time and engaging in more than a low level of risk.\u00a0 These volunteers will be classified as a Level 2, or 3. Examples of services that trigger a Level 2 or 3 classification can be found in Section I below, with corresponding preconditions found in Section II.I.\u00a0Volunteer Level ClassificationLevel 1 \u2013 Generally, most volunteers will be classified as Level 1. Volunteers serving at this level are expected to expend minimal time and engage in lower risk activities. Examples of Level 1 volunteers include:(a) a single afternoon passing out water;(b) guest speaking in a lecture; or(c) serving as a tour guide for short periods of time.Level 2 \u2013 Volunteers who engage in a service above minimal time or above the level of a lower risk activity. Examples of Level 2 service includes:(a) activity within a potentially hazardous area such as a University laboratory or mechanical room, e.g., Kettering Laboratories;(b) driving University owned, leased, or rented property, e.g., University vehicles, golf carts, or utility vehicles;(c) use of University owned and controlled equipment, e.g., University tools, forklift, etc.;(d) service that includes handling cash;(e) service in which the likelihood of an accident while performing the service or work is more than negligible, i.e., physical activity could result in injury;(f) service where the chance of damage of property from an accident is more than negligible if an accident occurred, e.g., any alteration to a University owned facility or ground; or(g) service that is performed more than three feet off the ground but no higher than a step stool or a 2-step ladder.\u00a0Level 3 \u2013 The services provided by Level 3 volunteers require controlled access to the UDit system or to University buildings.II. Additional Preconditions to Service Based on Level Classification.An individual serving the University as a volunteer is subject to the terms of this policy and may be subject to certain additional preconditions to be satisfied prior to that individual\u2019s service as a volunteer, based on the individual\u2019s classification as designated by a University representative. Level 1 is the default level for individuals serving as a volunteer, while Levels 2 and 3 require added preconditions. The University reserves the right to require the completion of any additional preconditions for any volunteer. Below are the designated levels and corresponding preconditions.Level 1Level 1 is the default level for individuals serving the University as a volunteer. Level 1 volunteers must comply with the general terms set forth in this policy.Level 2Level 2 volunteers must comply with the general terms set forth in this policy, sign the University of Dayton Volunteer Agreement, as well as successfully complete any additional preconditions as determined by a University representative.Level 3Level 3 volunteers must comply with all requirements set forth in this policy, sign the University of Dayton Volunteer Agreement, successfully complete a background check, consistent with the requirements of the University\u2019s Background Check Policy, successfully complete any addition preconditions as determined by a University Representative, and must provide any other applicable documentation required by the Office of Human Resources or Environmental Health & Safety \/ Risk Management (e.g., proof of insurance, etc.).III. General Terms Applicable to All University VolunteersA.

To serve as a volunteer, an individual must be under the general supervision of a University employee or a student organization recognized by the Center for Student Involvement.\u00a0C. Volunteers at the University of Dayton are expected to abide by all applicable University policies and procedures (including but not limited to the Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy), any confidentiality requirements applicable to the information to which they have access (which may require the signing of a confidentiality agreement), as well as any external regulations that govern their actions.D. Volunteers at the University of Dayton are expected to perform work and services in accordance with the University\u2019s Statement of Dignity, which recognizes that discrimination, harassment, or any other conduct that diminishes the worth of a person is incompatible with the University\u2019s fundamental commitment as a Catholic University. Specifically, under the Statement of Dignity:\u00a0 Every person regardless of race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, sex\/gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, genetic information, military status, veteran status, familial status or disability shall be treated with respect and dignity. No person shall be subject to any sexual, racial, psychological, physical, verbal or other similar harassment or abuse, or be denied equitable consideration for access to employment and the programs, services, and activities of the University.E. A background check may be required prior to certain volunteer service under the University of Dayton\u2019s Background Check Policy and the University of Dayton\u2019s Children on Campus and Working with Minors Policy.\u00a0 Additional training may also be required.\u00a0 Performance of volunteer service may be contingent on successful completion of one or both.F. Volunteers are not considered employees of the University of Dayton, nor are they covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act or other employment laws through the University of Dayton. Volunteers are not eligible for wages, compensation, employee benefits, workers\u2019 compensation, or unemployment benefits.G. A volunteer serves at the discretion of the University of Dayton. The University may discontinue the service of a volunteer for any reason, at any time, without prior notice or cause.H. Volunteers are prohibited, and must refrain, from performing the following:\nPerforming hazardous activities or operating heavy equipment\u00a0without prior written approval, including driving University owned, leased, or rented vehicles without first being certified according to the University Vehicle Use and Training Policy or other departmental safety training requirements;\nEntering into any contract on behalf of the University of Dayton unless such approval is granted in writing, and a signed Volunteer Agreement is on file;\nPerforming any activity that would be considered inappropriate for a University of Dayton employee;\nWorking in laboratories or with infectious agents, including human blood, unless all the necessary training has been completed.\nI. A volunteer may not use his or her volunteer position to compete with the University in any manner.\u00a0 A volunteer is expected to disclose any conflicts of interest (i.e., any circumstances that would impair the volunteer\u2019s ability to perform his or her volunteer services in a fair and impartial manner) to his or her supervisor, the Center for Student Involvement (if serving with a student organization), the Office of the Provost, or Human Resources when any such conflict exists.\u00a0 A volunteer shall avoid conflicts of interest with the University, subject to any contractual requirements between the University and that volunteer\u2019s sponsoring organization.\u00a0J. All rights, title, and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights pertaining thereto) in any and all works created, made, conceived, invented, developed, discovered or reduced to practice by a volunteer in the performance of his or her services for the University shall belong to the University, unless specified otherwise in writing and agreed to by the Office of Legal Affairs.K. A volunteer may not hold a University leadership position; cannot be responsible for directing other employees, work, or programs or be identified as \u201cdirector\u201d or by a similar term; does not have the authority to make decisions regarding employment or affecting the terms of a University employee\u2019s employment (e.g., supervisory responsibilities, including but not limited to the ability to hire, fire, etc.); does not have the authority to commit significant University resources to another party, service, project, etc.; and does not have the ability to bind the University contractually.\u00a0IV. Expense Reimbursement, Stipends, and Other Nominal BenefitsA. In accordance with University guidelines, individuals may be reimbursed for expenses in carrying out assigned duties.\u00a0 Such expenditures must be authorized in writing in advance by the volunteer\u2019s University supervisor.B. Volunteers may be provided certain nominal benefits related to their service, such as admission to University events or other privileges, as approved by their supervisor.C. All cash and cash equivalent awards (e.g., gift cards), gifts, or prizes, represent taxable income to the individual, beginning with the first dollar. All non-cash awards, gifts or prizes valued greater than $100 represent taxable compensation to the individual and are subject to the appropriate federal, state, and employment tax withholdings, as well as included on an individual\u2019s year-end tax document.V. General Eligibility and\/or Disqualification of VolunteersA.\u00a0 Any questions regarding the eligibility or suitability of an individual to serve as a University volunteer, or the applicability or satisfaction of the requirements of this policy, should be directed to the Office of Legal Affairs, the Office of Human Resources, or the Office of the Provost.\u00a0B.\u00a0 Any University employee who becomes aware of a volunteer\u2019s noncompliance with University policy or applicable law or regulation should, in addition to following any protocol be required by the policy or law\/regulation that has been violated, report the matter to the Office of Legal Affairs.\u00a0 The Office of Legal Affairs will coordinate resolution of the issue with (a) the Office of Human Resources if the volunteer is undertaking staff services; (b) the Office of the Provost if the volunteer is serving with faculty; or (c) the Division of Student Development if the volunteer is assisting in student activities.VI. Relationship to Other Standards, Practices or RequirementsNothing in this policy is meant to supersede or replace the standards of any other applicable University policy, law or regulation, or the protocols of any other entity involved with a volunteer service for the University.\u00a0 Satisfying the requirements of this policy does not relieve a person from any obligation he or she may have to follow the protocols of another policy or another entity that may apply to the particular situation. A volunteer\u2019s work and services should align with UD\u2019s Catholic and Marianist values. Additionally, individual University units maintain the discretion to impose measures beyond those required by this policy on University volunteers they have engaged.VII. \u00a0\u00a0 Unique SituationsRare circumstances may arise where a volunteer is desired to take on responsibilities beyond those contemplated by this policy. Such a volunteer is permitted only with written approval by the University President, General Counsel and (a) the Vice President for Human Resources (if the volunteer is undertaking staff services); (b) the Provost (if the volunteer is serving with or as faculty); or (c) the Vice President for Student Development (if the volunteer is assisting in student activities). Protocols and requirements will be developed for that particular volunteer situation which, at a minimum, will require compliance with all requirements applicable to a Level 3 Volunteer.Reference Documents\nUniversity of Dayton Background Check Policy\nUniversity of Dayton Children on Campus and Working with Minors Policy\nUniversity of Dayton Vehicle Use and Driver Training Policy\nFair Labor Standards Act\nUniversity of Dayton Policy on Authority to Formulate and Sign Contracts\nUniversity of Dayton Volunteer Agreement\nUniversity of Dayton Policy on the Use of Facilities\nUniversity of Dayton Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy\n\nUniversity of Dayton300 College ParkDayton, OH 45469937-229-1000info@udayton.eduhttps:\/\/udayton.eduRequest InfoVisitApplyContactDirectionsAlumniCareersBookstorefacebooktwitteryoutubeinstagramlinkedinPorchesPoliciesReport a ConcernPrivacy & TermsNondiscriminationDiversity\n\n\n","summary":"Recognizing the value of volunteers in furthering the University\u2019s vision, mission, and core values, this policy outlines the relationship between volunteers and the University of Dayton.\u00a0 This policy is meant to reduce risk and protect the interests of the University, its volunteers, and the community it serves."},{"university":"dayton","name":"electronicuseofconfidentialdata","policy":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Electronic Use of Confidential Data  : University of Dayton, Ohio\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Dayton\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nGive\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch University of Dayton\n\nSubmit Search\n\nGo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliciesInformation Technology Policies\nElectronic Use of Confidential Data \n\n\n Navigation \n                University of Dayton PoliciesAll PoliciesAcademic Affairs PoliciesAdvancement PoliciesAthletics PoliciesAudit, Risk and ComplianceCampus MinistryEnrollment Management PoliciesFacilities Management and Planning PoliciesFinance and Administration PoliciesHuman Resources PoliciesInformation Technology PoliciesChange Management for PCI Environments Confidentiality Agreement Requirement for Access to UD's Central SystemsDisposal and Redisposition of IT Equipment and Removable MediaElectronic Use of Confidential Data Fair Responsible and Acceptable Use of Electronic Resources FTC Red Flags RuleIT Incident Handling IT Remote Access PolicyPCI General PCI Systems StandardsServer Audits URL Assignments PolicyWeb Privacy Legal Affairs PoliciesMarketing and CommunicationsMission and Governance PoliciesResearch PoliciesStudent Development PoliciesElectronic Use of Confidential Data Policy HistoryEffective Date:\u00a0February 2008Approval:\u00a0December 17, 2015Policy History:\u00a0\nApproved in Original Form: February 2008\nApproved as Amended: December 17, 2015\nMaintenance of Policy: \u00a0UDit & VP for Finance and AdministrationScopeThis policy applies to all University personal computing and communication devices and all UD servers and services (whether located at UD or hosted externally) hosting data. Confidential data should not be hosted on personally owned devices.Individual data elements are classified as personally identifying or business sensitive in Appendix A. Separate documents within the associated framework will provide detailed standards describing how systems hosting these classifications, as well as public information, must be administered from data collection to system disposal.A future addendum to this policy should include guidance on the use, storage, and disposal of paper-based confidential information.PolicyThe University of Dayton has an obligation to protect the confidential data it collects and processes in pursuit of its business operations. Staff and students will be educated regularly as to the legal and ethical concerns\/requirements surrounding confidential data, their own as well as that of fellow students and colleagues, and its handling.Long used as unique identifiers, the Social Security Number (SSN) is a frequent target for identify theft and other illegal and harmful activities and requires special mention. The University\u2019s official position on the use of SSNs, based on executive directive, is to use SSNs only where explicitly required by law or explicitly approved by the Provost.In all other cases, the University requires the use of a unique University ID (UDID) number. The UDID numbers replace SSNs for identification and as indices to personnel records.\u00a0The following guidelines govern information classified as either personally identifying or business sensitive:\nDisclosure: Forms and web pages requesting confidential data should contain a privacy disclosure outlining, but not limited to, what will be collected, who authorized collection of this data, how the data will be used, how long the data will be maintained, how to correct data elements and who will have access to data\nStorage: Servers, whether located at UD or hosted externally, containing confidential data must be implemented in accordance with documented standards and subject to audit. All devices (including servers, backup tapes, desktop\/laptop computers, removable media and mobile communication devices) hosting confidential data require encryption of data at rest or suitable compensating control\nAccess: Access to confidential data is restricted to those with a demonstrated business need and requires regular renewal of a confidentiality agreement\nTransmission: Transmission of confidential data requires use of encrypted transport protocols\nDiscovery: Automated tools will be provided and used to discover and log existence of confidential data on servers and personal computing\/communications devices\nDisposal: Media housing confidential\/sensitive data must be physically destroyed or sanitized in accordance with NIST standards or equivalent upon disposal or redeployment in accordance with UD\u2019s Equipment and Removable Media Disposal\u00a0Policy\nServers will be periodically audited in accordance with UD\u2019s Server Audits policy to ensure adherence to standards for access, use, and storage of data types as outlined by this policy and related standards documents. An inventory of Approved Hosts of Confidential Information will be maintained, reviewed, and approved regularly by the VP for Finance and Administrative Services (or a delegate). Any exceptions to the framework requirements must be approved and documented.The authority to monitor and ensure compliance will be the responsibility of the UDit Risk Management Officer in cooperation with the CIO and VP for Finance and Administrative Services. Violations of this policy will be considered serious and will result in disciplinary action. An employee who violates this policy may be held responsible for the cost of mitigation due to loss or breach.Reference Documents\nISO 27002 2013 Sec. #8.2\nUDit Incident Handling Policy\nApplicable Regulations\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)\nAppendix A: Data ClassificationThis appendix attempts to identify the individual elements of data categorized as either personally identifying or business sensitive.I.

being used, the University will comply with IRS regulations and other applicable laws, and expects all employees to assist in this commitment by adhering to University policies and practices as well as federal, state and local laws concerning gifts and awards.\u00a0 Disregard for IRS or other legal requirements in the performance of one\u2019s duties for the University may be subject to disciplinary action by the University.CASHAll cash and cash equivalent awards (e.g. gift cards), gifts or prizes, represent taxable income to the individual, beginning with the first dollar.\u00a0 Cash and cash equivalents are never considered de minimis regardless of the dollar amount.NON-CASHAll non-cash awards, gifts or prizes valued at $100 or less may be considered de minimis.\u00a0 De minimis awards, gifts and prizes may only be provided on an occasional basis.\u00a0 Anything\u00a0 greater than $100 represents taxable compensation to the individual and is subject to the appropriate federal, state and employment tax withholdings, as well as included on an individual\u2019s year-end tax document.LIFE EVENTSA life event acknowledgement may include a non-cash item or a financial donation to a charitable organization using University funds in accordance with University guidelines.\u00a0 Such life event acknowledgements, when de minimis, do not represent taxable income to the individual.\u00a0 Any financial donation must follow the Guidelines for Charitable Giving Using UD Funds, which include but are not limited by certain approvals and reporting requirements.PARTICIPANTS IN UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON RESEARCH STUDIESThe University IRB (Institutional Review Board) approves and governs research studies involving human subjects.\u00a0 Any participant in a research study should follow the applicable IRB guidelines.\u00a0 IRS regulations allow employees participating in research studies to be compensated outside the Payroll system as long as the nature of the activity performed by the employee is separate and distinct from the responsibilities associated with his\/her position at the University.FOREIGN RECIPIENTSAny payment to a foreign individual should be made in compliance with the University\u2019s Non-Resident Payment Policy.RAFFLESAny raffles or games of chance require pre-approval by both the Office of Legal Affairs and the Tax Manager, to ensure that

department) will result in no tax consequences to the recipient.\u00a0 However, personal contributions cannot be combined with University funds nor used to offset the value of a non cash item to qualify as de minimis.\nAll personal contributions must be paid directly to the vendor.\u00a0 If any reimbursement from the University is sought, the entire amount of the gift will be used to

Maintenance of Policy:\u00a0Director, Contracts and GrantsScopeThis policy applies to the University of Dayton\u2019s college, schools, departments, and Research Institute conducting sponsored research.PolicyFederal regulations provide principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost. General provisions for selected items of cost are contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, Section J, to be superseded by the OMB Uniform Guidance, Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles. These principles apply irrespective of whether a particular item of cost is treated as a direct cost or a facility and administrative (F&A or indirect) cost.Unallowable costs should be either properly segregated in the University\u2019s accounting system or identifiable from departmental records to ensure that they will not be charged to the government.In cases of discrepancy between the provisions of a specific sponsored agreement and the provisions of Circular A-21, the agreement should govern.The following is a quick reference guide for determining \u201cunallowable\u201d costs. It is not intended to replace Circular A-21. Refer to the complete text for establishing allowability of costs.\nAdvertising \u2013 costs of advertising designed solely to promote the institution are unallowable. Advertising for recruitment of employees or human subjects is allowable.\nAlcoholic Beverages\nAlumni Activities\nBad Debts\nCommencement or Convocation Costs\nContingency Provisions\nCharitable Contributions, Donations, Remembrances\nEntertainment costs, including amusement diversion, social activities, and any costs directly associated with such costs (such as tickets to shows or sporting events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities)\nFines and Penalties\nFund Raising and Investment Costs\nGoods or Services for Personal Use of Employees (including office gifts)\nHousing and Personal Living Expenses of University Officers\nInterest (with specific exceptions)\nLobbying\nLosses on other sponsored agreements or contracts (cost overruns).\u00a0 Any excess of costs over income under any other sponsored agreement or contract of any nature is unallowable.\u00a0 This includes, but is not limited to, the institutions contributed portion by reason of cost-sharing agreements or any under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for indirect costs.\nMemberships in any civic or community organization, country club, social or dining club\nPatents (with specific exceptions)\nPre-agreement costs, unless approved by the sponsoring agency or permitted under expanded authorities\nPublic Relations costs of meetings, conventions, convocations or other activities of the institution including : (a) costs of displays, demonstrations, and exhibits; (b) costs of meeting rooms, hospitality suites, and other special facilities used in conjunction with shows and other special events; and (c) salaries and wages of employees engaged in setting up and displaying exhibits, making demonstrations and providing briefings.\u00a0 Costs of promotional items and memorabilia, including models, gifts, and souvenirs are also unallowable.\u00a0 See A-21 for specific exceptions, which may include costs specifically required by the award, communicating with the public and press pertaining to specific activities or accomplishments which result from the performance of the award, and conducting general liaison with news media and others as necessary to keep the public informed on matters of public concern.\nSelling and marketing of any products or services of the institution, except as direct costs with prior approval of the sponsor.\nStudent activity costs incurred for intramural activities, student publications, student clubs, etc.\nIn addition to unallowable costs, charges to federally sponsored agreements must also exclude costs that are directly associated with the unallowable costs.\u00a0 A directly associated cost is defined in federal regulations as any cost which is generated solely as a result of the incidence of another cost, and which would not have been incurred had the other cost not been incurred.\u00a0 An example of the cost that is directly associated with an unallowable cost is the cost of airfare to go to another city for the purpose of entertaining business associates, or for fundraising.\u00a0 Since the entertainment and fundraising costs are expressly unallowable under OMB Circular A-21, and the airfare would not have been incurred had the unallowable costs not been incurred, the airfare is an unallowable directly associated cost.RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCEMENT, REMEDIES , SANCTIONSThe Office of Contracts and Grants, UDRI Director\u2019s Office, Research Accounting, and Research Purchasing Offices are responsible for enforcement of this policy to ensure that no unallowable costs are charged to sponsored programs.Applicable Federal Regulations\nOffice Of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions, Section J, to be superseded by the OMB Uniform Guidance, Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles.\n\nUniversity of Dayton300 College ParkDayton, OH 45469937-229-1000info@udayton.eduhttps:\/\/udayton.eduRequest InfoVisitApplyContactDirectionsAlumniCareersBookstorefacebooktwitteryoutubeinstagramlinkedinPorchesPoliciesReport a ConcernPrivacy & TermsNondiscriminationDiversity\n\n\n","summary":"The purpose of this policy is to ensure compliance with federal regulations regarding unallowable costs for sponsored research programs."},{"university":"dayton","name":"emergencyshowerinstallationandmaintenance","policy":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Emergency Shower Installation and Maintenance : University of Dayton, Ohio\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Dayton\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nGive\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch University of Dayton\n\nSubmit Search\n\nGo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliciesAudit, Risk and Compliance\nEmergency Shower Installation and Maintenance\n\n\n Navigation \n                University of Dayton PoliciesAll PoliciesAcademic Affairs PoliciesAdvancement PoliciesAthletics PoliciesAudit, Risk and ComplianceAsbestos Management PolicyEmergency Shower Installation and MaintenanceEnvironmental Health and Safety PolicyFire Safety and Evacuation PolicyHazardous Materials Management PolicyLaboratory\/Technical Area Safety PolicyOpen Flame PolicySafety Training PolicyDrone\/Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) PolicyGolf Cart\/Utility Vehicle PolicyVehicle Use and Driver Certification PolicyCampus MinistryEnrollment Management PoliciesFacilities Management and Planning PoliciesFinance and Administration PoliciesHuman Resources PoliciesInformation Technology PoliciesLegal Affairs PoliciesMarketing and CommunicationsMission and Governance PoliciesResearch PoliciesStudent Development PoliciesEmergency Shower Installation and MaintenanceScopeFacilities Planning and Construction Management will work with the appropriate parties, such as Environmental Health & Safety, etc., to ensure that the emergency showers are appropriately located, alarmed and marked.

The university\u2019s internal networks, its computer hosts and the various services not intended to be made publicly available are restricted to campus access.\u00a0 Remote access to these resources may be necessary on occasion to allow an employee to work remotely, a vendor to repair or upgrade a server, a student to collaborate on a project, etc.\u00a0 The following rules will apply:\nAny access to these resources requires authentication thru one of UD\u2019s formal VPN solutions. Given the nature of the resources on the Academic network, UDit will actively restrict the use of cloud-based, remote access tools - GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, Teamviewer, etc. at the application level on that network.\u00a0\nIt is the responsibility of all employees and students with VPN privileges to ensure that unauthorized users are not allowed access to internal university networks and associated content. University usernames and passwords shall not be shared.\nEnd users shall ensure that all devices connecting remotely have current anti-virus software, are patched with respect to operating system and application updates and have firewalls enabled.\nSolutions that circumvent routing and security solutions shall be identified and disabled.\nAll university acceptable use and security policies that apply to access from on-campus workstations also apply to users of remotely connecting workstations.\nAs documented in UD\u2019s Electronic Use of Confidential Data policy, all reasonable efforts should be made to protect University data, keeping it on secured servers and devices wherever possible and never copied to personal equipment.\n\u00a0Reference Documents\nUniversity of Dayton Telecommuting Policy\nISO 27002 2013 Sec. # 9.1.2\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework PR.AC-3\n\nUniversity of Dayton300 College ParkDayton, OH 45469937-229-1000info@udayton.eduhttps:\/\/udayton.eduRequest InfoVisitApplyContactDirectionsAlumniCareersBookstorefacebooktwitteryoutubeinstagramlinkedinPorchesPoliciesReport a ConcernPrivacy & TermsNondiscriminationDiversity\n\n\n","summary":"This policy\u00a0details the University of Dayton\u2019s policy regarding off-campus access to its internal networks and non-public IT equipment and information resources."}]
