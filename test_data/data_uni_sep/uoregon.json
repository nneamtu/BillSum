A party to the mediation may disclose confidential mediation communications to a person for the purpose of obtaining advice concerning the subject matter of the mediation, if all the parties agree.(f) A written mediation communication may be disclosed or introduced as evidence in a subsequent proceeding at the discretion of the party who prepared the communication so long as the communication is not otherwise confidential under state or federal law and does not contain confidential information from the mediator or another party who does not agree to the disclosure.(g) In any proceeding to enforce, modify or set aside a mediation agreement, a party to the mediation may disclose mediation communications and such communications may be introduced as evidence to the extent necessary to prosecute or defend the matter. At the request of a party, the court may seal any part of the record of the proceeding to prevent further disclosure of mediation communications or agreements to persons other than the parties to the agreement.(h) In an action for damages or other relief between a party to the mediation and a mediator or mediation program, mediation communications are not confidential and may be disclosed and may be introduced as evidence to the extent necessary to prosecute or defend the matter.

The University or the mediator may use or disclose confidential mediation communications for research, training or educational purposes, subject to the provisions of ORS 36.232(4).(8) The terms of any agreement arising out of the mediation of a workplace interpersonal dispute are confidential so long as the parties and the agency so agree in writing. Any term of an agreement that requires an expenditure of public funds, other than expenditures $1,000 or less for employee training, employee counseling or purchases of equipment that remain the property of the University, may not be made confidential.(9) When a mediation is subject to section (6) of this policy, the University will provide to all parties to the mediation and to the mediator a copy of this section or an explanation of where a copy of the policy may be obtained. Violation of this provision does not waive confidentiality or inadmissibility.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

A Research Professor will have qualifications and research expectations equal to or exceeding those for a tenure-track\/tenured professor at the same rank in related fields.j. POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR: This category can only be used in the Postdoctoral Scholar classification. This category requires a non-tenure track paid appointment for a temporary and defined period of formally mentored research, instruction, librarianship, or scholarly training, for the purpose of allowing the Postdoctoral Scholar to acquire the professional skills needed to pursue a career path of his or her choosing. The appointment requires a doctoral degree. At the time of appointment, hiring documentation should include an articulated program of mentoring with an identified mentor.(4) The following are the ranks within categories that apply to faculty members. Ranks define the level of promotion within a category.a. PROFESSOR: Ranks in this category in ascending order are assistant professor, associate professor, and professor.b. CLINICAL PROFESSOR: Ranks in this category in ascending order are assistant clinical professor, associate clinical professor, and clinical professor.c. PROFESSOR OF PRACTICE: The only rank in this category is professor of practice.d. INSTRUCTOR: Ranks in this category in ascending order are instructor, senior instructor I, senior instructor II.e. LECTURER: Ranks in this category in ascending order are lecturer, senior lecturer I, senior lecturer II.f. LIBRARIAN: Ranks in this category in ascending order are assistant librarian, associate librarian, and senior librarian.g. RESEARCH ASSISTANT: Ranks in this category in ascending order are research assistant, senior research assistant I, senior research assistant II.h. RESEARCH ASSOCIATE: Ranks in this category in ascending order are research associate, senior research associate I, senior research associate II.i. RESEARCH PROFESSOR: Ranks in this category in ascending order are assistant research professor, associate research professor, and research professor.j. POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR: The only rank in this category is Postdoctoral Scholar.(5) At the time of hire, the University shall assign each faculty member a rank within the classification and category described in the job posting. Nothing shall preclude a faculty member from being assigned and performing other duties not described in his or her specific classification, category, or rank as long as those duties are consistent with his or her job description. Academic title can be assigned to staff members in unclassified academic service, whether the type of service is teaching, research, extension, administration or other service. Deans, vice presidents, and the President may have the academic rank of professor as determined by the University\u2019s criteria.(6) If the University non-renews a position in the Career classification for economic or programmatic reasons, then the position cannot be refilled in the Visiting, Pro Tem or Postdoctoral Scholar classification within the subsequent two years unless approved by the Provost or his or her designee.(7) The duration of a position in the Pro Tem classification shall be no more than three years. If the University decides to continue a position in the Pro Tem classification for longer than three years, the position must be converted to a Career position. In rare cases, a department or unit may petition the Provost to continue a position in the Pro Tem classification for longer than three years for legitimate pedagogical or legitimate programmatic reasons. Permission to continue a position in the Pro Tem classification for longer than three years must be granted by the Provost or designee in writing.(8) The duration of a position in the Postdoctoral Scholar classification shall be no more than three years. Postdoctoral mentors, however, may petition the Provost or designee for an extension of no more than two years. Permission to continue a position in the Postdoctoral Scholar classification for longer than three years must be granted by the Provost or designee in writing.(9) Faculty members in the Career classification shall have the right to petition the Provost or designee to have their position recategorized if they believe that their position was categorized incorrectly at the time of first hire or their position has evolved to more closely resemble a different category. If a petition for recategorization is denied, a faculty member may petition again after completion of at least one additional year of service in the position.(10) Faculty members in the Pro Tem or Visiting or Postdoctoral Scholar classification who believe that their positions should be positions in the Career classification may petition for reclassification after the completion of two years of appointment. Because the defining characteristic of the Pro Tem and Visiting and Postdoctoral Scholar classifications is their limited duration, the decision of the Provost or designee should be guided by the current and anticipated duration of the position.(11) When a position is reclassified from a non-tenure track classification into the Tenure Track and Tenured classification, a new national search is always required to fill the position. For other classifications, a national search is permissible, but not required when the original search was national in scope and when the incumbent has had successful reviews.(12) A reclassification or recategorization shall take effect at the beginning of the next fiscal year, contract renewal, or academic year, or other date as approved by the Provost or designee.(13) A change in rank within a category requires a promotion.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 2: Appointments, promotion and tenure\nOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(42 CFR 93.201)Bad Faith means a material and demonstrable failure to meet the standards for Good Faith set forth herein as a Complainant, a witness, an Inquiry Panel member, an Investigation Panel member, or the RIO. The context in which actions have occurred is a relevant and important factor to be taken into account in determining whether an individual has acted in Bad Faith.Complaint means a Person who in Good Faith makes an Allegation of Research Misconduct. A Complainant need not be a member of the University community. (42 CFR 93.203)Conflict of Interest means any personal, professional, or financial relationship that influences or reasonably would be perceived to influence the impartial performance of a duty assigned under this Policy by any of the following: a member of an Inquiry Panel, Investigation Panel, the RIO, the DO, the Provost or the President.Counsel means lay or legal counsel secured by a Respondent to serve as an advisor to the Respondent in Misconduct Proceedings against the Respondent.Evidence means any document, tangible item, or testimony offered or obtained during a Research Misconduct Proceeding that tends to prove or disprove the existence of an alleged fact relevant to the Allegation at issue in that Misconduct Proceeding.

(42 CFR 93.219)Policy means this policy concerning Allegations of Misconduct in Research.Questionable Research Practices means practices that do not constitute Misconduct or Unacceptable Research Practices but that require attention because they could erode confidence in the integrity of Research.Recklessly means disregard for or indifference to the consequences or risks of one's acts.Research encompasses the scholarly production of knowledge. This includes a systematic experiment, study, evaluation, demonstration or survey designed to develop, interpret or contribute to general knowledge (basic research) or specific knowledge (applied research). Research may be conducted by: (1) a faculty member or other employee of the University as part of his or her non-instructional scholarly activities, or (2) a student in fulfillment of any independent study requirement at the University whose product is intended to be an original scholarly or creative work of potentially publishable quality (including, without being limited to, a master's project or thesis, or doctoral dissertation).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AA.\u00a0 RIO means the University's Research Integrity Officer.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 BB. \u00a0Research Record means the record of data or results from scholarly inquiry, including, without being limited to, Research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, journal articles, books and other publications of any kind in any media and any material in any media necessary to support the content of any such document, presentation, or publication.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CC.\u00a0 Respondent means the person against whom an Allegation of Research Misconduct is directed or who is the subject of a Research Misconduct Proceeding.

The context in which an adverse action has occurred, including its materiality, is a relevant and important factor to be taken into account in determining whether it constitutes Retaliation.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EE.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sequestration means the process of securing Evidence.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 FF.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Significant Departure means a marked divergence from standard practices.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GG.\u00a0\u00a0Unacceptable Research Practices means practices that do not constitute Misconduct but that violate applicable laws, regulations, or other governmental requirements, or University rules or policies, of which the Respondent had received notice or of which the Respondent reasonably should have been aware, for proposing, performing, reviewing, or reporting Research.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HH.\u00a0\u00a0VPRI means the University's Vice President for Research and Innovation.\u00a0\u00a0PREAMBLEThe University of Oregon is committed to supporting a research community that operates at the highest level of integrity.\u00a0 This commitment extends not only to supporting research that is conducted with high, technical quality but with the collegial, professional and ethical processes with which research is performed.\u00a0 As part of this commitment it is necessary to clarify actions that are not acceptable (e.g. constitute research misconduct) and the procedures that will allow both the unveiling of research misconduct and adequate safeguards against the potential damage caused by inappropriate accusations.\u00a0 With the goal of promoting research integrity, this policy defines (a) \"research misconduct,\" (b) the steps for making an allegation of research misconduct, and (c) the steps for examining and acting on such allegations.\u00a0Professional misconduct is unacceptable in all forms. Research Misconduct is a specific type of professional misconduct that involves \"fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The need for formal processes for defining and acting on allegations of research misconduct include the following:1.Public trust is generated on the faith that conclusions are accurate to the best of our knowledge and ability.\u00a0 Academic honesty is critical to the reliability of the knowledge yet to be discovered.2.Defining a high expectation for research integrity establishes a community of scholarship that minimizes research misconduct.3.Universities receiving federal funds must comply with requirements promulgated by the federal agencies to ensure high integrity in the research process, and formal procedures for addressing instances of research misconduct.4.The right of the University to self-govern and self-regulate brings a responsibility to create clear procedures for defining and responding to research misconduct\u00a0Members at all levels of the academic community (students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff) have a responsibility to encourage high research integrity and report instances of what they, in good faith, believe to be a lack of integrity in scholarship and research.\u00a0 Examination of such a concern is a continuation of the search for intellectual truth, not a breach of collegiality.\u00a0 The University of Oregon seeks to emphasize education about ethical issues, to achieve consensus regarding good ethics, and to promote ethical research practices.\u00a0NOTE: Portions of the Preamble text are adapted with permission from the Colorado State University Administrative Procedures for Research Misconduct. Portions of the Policy are adapted from the federal Office for Research Integrity sample policy, and Michigan State University's policy.\u00a0\u00a0POLICY STATEMENTThis Policy applies to Allegations of Research Misconduct and Research Misconduct involving:Applications or proposals for support for Research, research training or activities related to that Research or research training, such as the operation of tissue and data banks and the dissemination of Research information;all Research, whether funded or not;all research training programs, whether funded or not;all activities that are related to Research or research training, such as the operation of tissue and data banks or the dissemination of Research information, whether funded or not; andPlagiarism of Research Records produced in the course of Research, research training or activities related to that Research or research training. This includes any Research proposed, performed, reviewed or reported, or any Research Record generated from that Research, regardless of whether an application or proposal for extramural funds resulted in a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other form of extramural support.This Policy does not apply to authorship or collaboration disputes.This Policy applies only to Allegations of Research Misconduct that occurred within the timeframes set forth by the applicable agency regulations.The University accepts the following definition established by the U.S. Public Health Service: \"Misconduct means Fabrication, Falsification, or Plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing Research, or in reporting Research results. Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating Research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the Research is not accurately represented in the Research Record. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. Research Misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.\u00a0In order for a finding of Misconduct to be made, the following three criteria must be met:There must be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant Research community; and,The Misconduct must be committed Intentionally, Knowingly or Recklessly; and,The Allegation must be proven by a Preponderance of the Evidence.\" (42 CFR 93.103, 104; 45 CFR 689.1, 2(c), DoDI 3210.7 E2.1.4, 10)Confidentiality: Disclosure of the identity of Respondents and Complainants in Research Misconduct Proceedings is limited, to the extent possible, to those who need to know, consistent with a thorough, competent, objective and fair Research Misconduct Proceeding.\u00a0Except as may otherwise be prescribed by applicable law, confidentiality must be maintained for any records or Evidence from which Research subjects might be identified. Disclosure is limited to those who have a need to know to carry out a Research Misconduct Proceeding.\u00a0ROLES RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Vice President for Research and Innovation (VPRI) or designee is responsible for the University's compliance with applicable federal regulations, including but not limited to notifying sponsoring agencies at the appropriate time and keeping the University's Inquiry Panels and Investigation Panels well informed with respect to the compliance requirements placed upon them. In the event the VPRI or designee has a potential Conflict of Interest with respect to a particular Allegation of Misconduct, the President or designee shall determine who shall be responsible for review of the particular Allegation.\u00a0For purposes of this Policy, the current designee of the VPRI for all Research Integrity Officer (RIO) responsibilities may be found on the website of the VPRI.Deciding Official (DO) means the institutional official who makes final determinations on Allegations of Research Misconduct and any institutional administrative actions; the Vice President for Research and Innovation serves as the Deciding Official. The Deciding Official will not be the same individual as the Research Integrity Officer and should have no direct prior involvement in the institution's Inquiry, Investigation, or allegation assessment. A DO's appointment of an individual to assess Allegations of Research Misconduct, or to serve on an Inquiry Panel or Investigation Panel, is not considered to be direct prior involvement. The DO appoints the chair and members of the Inquiry Panel and Investigation Panel, ensures that those panels are properly staffed and ensures that there is expertise appropriate to carry out a thorough and authoritative evaluation of the Evidence. The DO also determines whether each person involved in handling an Allegation of Research Misconduct has an unresolved personal, professional, or financial Conflict of Interest and shall take appropriate action, including recusal, to ensure that no person with such conflict is involved in the Research Misconduct Proceeding. In cooperation with other institutional officials, the DO will take all reasonable and practical steps to protect or restore the positions and reputations of Good Faith Complainants, witnesses, and panel members and counter potential or actual retaliation against them by Respondents or other Institutional Members. In the event the Vice President for Research and Innovation or designee has a potential Conflict of Interest with respect to a particular Allegation of Misconduct, the President or designee shall determine who shall be responsible as DO for review of the particular Allegation.\u00a0The DO will receive the Inquiry report and after consulting with the RIO and\/or other institutional officials, decide whether an Investigation is warranted under the criteria in 42 CFR \u00a7 93.307(d), 7 CFR \u00a7 3022.3 or other applicable regulation. Any finding that an Investigation is warranted must be made in writing by the DO and must be provided to the relevant federal agency, together with a copy of the Inquiry report meeting the requirements of 42 CFR \u00a7 93.309, 45 CFR \u00a7 689.4(b)(2)(d), 7 CFR \u00a7 3022.6, DoDI 3210.7 E4.1.5 or other applicable regulation within 30 days of the finding. If it is found that an Investigation is not warranted, the DO and the RIO will ensure that detailed documentation of the Inquiry is retained for at least 7 years after termination of the Inquiry, so that the federal agencies may assess the reasons why the institution decided not to conduct an Investigation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The DO will receive the Investigation report and, after consulting with the RIO and\/or other institutional officials, decide whether Research Misconduct occurred and, if so, decide what, if any, institutional administrative actions are appropriate. The DO shall ensure that the final Investigation report, the findings of the DO and a description of any pending or completed administrative actions are provided to the correct federal agency, as required by regulation (42 CFR 93.315, 45 CFR 689.4(b)(5), 7 CFR 3022.10, DoDI 3210.7 E4.1.7).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Research Integrity Officer (RIO)means the institutional official responsible for: (1) assessing Allegations of Research Misconduct to determine if they fall within the definition of Research Misconduct, are covered by 42 CFR \u00a7 93, 45 CFR \u00a7 689, 7 CFR \u00a7 3022, DoDI 3210.7 and other applicable regulations, and warrant an Inquiry on the basis that the Allegation is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential Evidence of Research Misconduct may be identified; and (2) overseeing Inquires and Investigations. These responsibilities include the following duties related to Research Misconduct Proceedings:Consult confidentially with persons uncertain about whether to submit an Allegation of Research Misconduct;Receive Allegations of Research Misconduct;Assess each Allegation of Research Misconduct in accordance with Section VII(B) of this Policy to determine whether it falls within the definition of Research Misconduct and warrants an Inquiry;As necessary, take interim action and notify federal agencies of special circumstances, in accordance with Section V(F) of this Policy;Sequester Research data and Evidence pertinent to the Allegation of Research Misconduct in accordance with Section V(E) of this Policy and maintain it securely in accordance with this Policy and applicable law and regulation;Provide confidentiality to those involved in the Research Misconduct Proceeding as required by 42 CFR \u00a7 93.108, other applicable law, and institutional policy;Notify the Respondent and provide opportunities for him\/her to review\/ comment\/respond to Allegations, Evidence, and panel reports in accordance with Section V(D) of this Policy;Inform Respondents, Complainants, and witnesses of the procedural steps in the Research Misconduct Proceeding;Assist the DO in determining whether each person involved in handling an Allegation of Research Misconduct has an unresolved personal, professional, or financial Conflict of Interest and take appropriate action, including recusal, to ensure that no person with such conflict is involved in the Research Misconduct Proceeding;In cooperation with other institutional officials, take all reasonable and practical steps to protect or restore the positions and reputations of Good Faith Complainants, witnesses, and panel members and counter potential or actual retaliation against them by Respondents or other Institutional Members;Keep the DO and all relevant parties apprised of the progress of the review of the Allegation of Research Misconduct;Notify and make reports to federal agencies as required by law;Ensure that administrative actions taken by the institution and federal agencies are enforced and take appropriate action to notify other involved parties, such as sponsors, funding agencies, law enforcement agencies, professional societies, and licensing boards of those actions; andMaintain records of the Research Misconduct Proceeding and make them available to federal agencies in accordance with Section V(G) of this Policy.Complainant: The Complainant is responsible for making Allegations in Good Faith, maintaining confidentiality, and cooperating with the Inquiry and Investigation. As a matter of good practice, the Complainant should be interviewed at the Inquiry stage, given the transcript or recording of the interview, and have the opportunity to correct and resubmit the transcription. The Complainant must be interviewed during an Investigation, be given the transcript or recording of the interview, and be able to correct and resubmit the transcription. The Complainant is entitled to:reasonable and practical efforts by the institution to maintain the Complainant's identity in confidence, upon request.Respondent: The Respondent is responsible for maintaining confidentiality and cooperating with the conduct of an Inquiry and Investigation. The Respondent is entitled to:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Good Faith effort from the RIO to notify the Respondent in writing at the time of or before beginning an Inquiry;An opportunity to comment on the Inquiry report and have his\/her comments attached to the report;Be notified of the outcome of the Inquiry, and receive a copy of the Inquiry report that includes a copy of, or refers to applicable regulations and the institution's policies and procedures on Research Misconduct;Be notified in writing of the Allegations to be investigated within a reasonable time after the determination that an Investigation is warranted, but before the Investigation begins (within 30 days after the institution decides to begin an Investigation), and be notified in writing of any new Allegations not addressed in the Inquiry or in the initial notice of Investigation within a reasonable time after the determination to pursue those Allegations;Be interviewed during the Investigation, have the opportunity to have the recording or transcript, to correct the transcript, and have the corrected transcript included in the record of the Investigation;Have interviewed during the Investigation any witness who has been reasonably identified by the Respondent as having information on relevant aspects of the Investigation, have the recording or transcript provided to the witness, the opportunity for the witness to correct the transcript, and have the corrected transcript included in the record of Investigation; andReceive a copy of the draft Investigation report and, concurrently, a copy of, or supervised access to the Evidence on which the report is based, and be notified that any comments must be submitted within 30 days of the date on which the copy was received and that the comments will be considered by the institution and addressed in the final report.\u00a0The Respondent should be given the opportunity to admit that Research Misconduct occurred and that he\/she committed the Research Misconduct. With the advice of the RIO and\/or other institutional officials, the DO may terminate the institution's review of an Allegation that has been admitted, if the institution's acceptance of the admission and any proposed settlement is approved by the appropriate federal agency.\u00a0As provided by regulation and this Policy, the Respondent will have the opportunity to request an institutional appeal.\u00a0OTHER POLICY PRINCIPLESResponsibility to Report Misconduct. All Institutional Members will report observed, suspected, or apparent Research Misconduct to the RIO. If an individual is unsure whether a suspected incident falls within the definition of Research Misconduct, he or she may meet with or contact the RIO to discuss the suspected Research Misconduct informally, which may include discussing it anonymously and\/or hypothetically. If the circumstances described by the individual do not meet the definition of Research Misconduct, the RIO will refer the individual or Allegation to other officials with responsibility for resolving the problem.\u00a0At any time, an Institutional Member may have confidential discussions and consultations about concerns of possible Misconduct with the RIO and will be counseled about appropriate procedures for reporting Allegations.Cooperation with Research Misconduct Proceedings. Institutional Members will cooperate with the RIO and other institutional officials in the review of Allegations and the conduct of inquiries and Investigations. Institutional Members, including Respondents, have an obligation to provide Evidence relevant to Research Misconduct Allegations to the RIO and other institutional officials.Protecting Complainants, Witnesses, and Panel Members. Institutional Members may not retaliate in any way against Complainants, witnesses, or panel members. Institutional Members should immediately report any alleged or apparent retaliation against Complainants, witnesses or panel members to the RIO. The RIO will review the Allegation of retaliation and, if necessary, work with other institutional officials to make all reasonable and practical efforts to counter any potential or actual retaliation and protect and restore the position and reputation of the person against whom the retaliation is directed.Protecting the Respondent. As requested and as appropriate, the RIO and other institutional officials shall make all reasonable and practical efforts to protect or restore the reputation of persons alleged to have engaged in Research Misconduct, but against whom no finding of Research Misconduct is made.\u00a0During the Research Misconduct Proceeding, the RIO is responsible for ensuring that Respondents receive all the notices and opportunities provided for in 42 CFR Part 93 and the policies and procedures of the University. Respondents may consult with legal Counsel or a personal advisor (who is not a principal or witness in the case) to seek advice and may bring the Counsel or the personal adviser to interviews or meetings on the case. However, Respondent's Counsel or personal advisor presence at interviews or meetings is restricted to advising (as opposed to representing or responding on behalf of) the Respondent.Sequestering the Evidence. At the time of or before beginning an Inquiry, the RIO must make a Good Faith effort to notify the Respondent(s) in writing, if the Respondent is known. If the Inquiry subsequently identifies additional Respondents, they must be notified in writing. On or before the date on which the Respondent is notified, or the Inquiry begins, whichever is earlier, the RIO must take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the Research Records and Evidence needed to conduct the Research Misconduct Proceeding, inventory the records and Evidence and sequester them in a secure manner, except that where the Research Records or Evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or Evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of the instruments. The RIO may consult with federal agencies for advice and assistance in this regard.\u00a0The manner in which sequestration shall occur will to the maximum extent possible, while complying with 42 CFR 93.307, 7 CFR \u00a7 3022.11(b),(c) and other applicable federal regulations, protect the confidentiality of the Respondent and his or her ability to continue his or her program of ResearchInterim Administrative Actions and Notification to Agencies of Special Circumstances. Throughout the Research Misconduct Proceeding, the RIO will review the situation to determine if there is any threat of harm to public health, federal funds and equipment, or the integrity of the Public Health Service (PHS) or other federally supported Research process. In the event of such a threat, the RIO will, in consultation with other institutional officials and appropriate federal agencies, take appropriate interim action to protect against any such threat. Interim action might include additional monitoring of the Research process and the handling of federal funds and equipment, reassignment of personnel or of the responsibility for the handling of federal funds and equipment, additional review of Research data and results or delaying publication. The RIO shall, at any time during a Research Misconduct Proceeding, notify the appropriate federal agency immediately if he\/she has reason to believe that any of the following conditions exist:Health or safety of the public is at risk, including an immediate need to protect human or animal subjects;Federal agency resources or interests are threatened;Research activities should be suspended;There is a reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law;The Research Misconduct Proceeding at any point reveals behavior that may be criminal in nature;Federal action is required to protect the interests of those involved in the Research Misconduct Proceeding;The Research Misconduct Proceeding may be made public prematurely and appropriate federal agency action may be necessary to safeguard Evidence and protect the rights of those involved; or,The Research community or public should be informed.Maintaining Records for Federal Agency Review. The RIO must maintain and provide to appropriate federal agencies upon request \"records of Research Misconduct Proceedings.\" Unless custody has been transferred to a federal agency or a federal agency has advised in writing that the records no longer need to be retained, records of Research Misconduct Proceedings must be securely maintained for 7 years after completion of the proceeding or the completion of any federal agency proceeding involving the Research Misconduct Allegation. The RIO is also responsible for providing any information, documentation, Research Records, Evidence or clarification requested by a federal agency to carry out its review of an Allegation of Research Misconduct or of the institution's handling of such an Allegation.Completion of Cases; Reporting Premature Closures to Federal Agencies. Generally, all Inquiries and Investigations will be carried through to completion and all significant issues will be pursued diligently. The RIO must notify the appropriate federal agency in advance if there are plans to close a case at the Inquiry, Investigation, or appeal stage on the basis that Respondent has admitted guilt, a settlement with the Respondent has been reached, or for any other reason, except: (1) closing of a case at the Inquiry stage on the basis that an Investigation is not warranted; or (2) a finding of no Misconduct at the Investigation stage, which must be reported to the appropriate federal agency, as prescribed in this Policy.Respondent Termination or Resignation Prior to Completing Inquiry or Investigation. The termination of the Respondent's institutional employment, by resignation or otherwise, before or after an Allegation of possible Research Misconduct has been reported, will not preclude or terminate the Research Misconduct Proceeding or otherwise limit any of the institution's responsibilities.\u00a0If the Respondent, without admitting to the Misconduct, elects to resign his or her position after the institution receives an Allegation of Research Misconduct, the assessment of the Allegation will proceed, as well as the Inquiry and Investigation phases, as appropriate based on the outcome of the preceding steps. If the Respondent refuses to participate in the process after resignation, the RIO, DO and any Inquiry or Investigation Panel will use their best efforts to reach a conclusion concerning the Allegations, noting in the report the Respondent's failure to cooperate and its effect on the Evidence.\u00a0\u00a0EXCLUSIONS AND SPECIAL SITUATIONSInterim Administrative Actions and Notifying Federal Agencies of Special Circumstances: Throughout the Research Misconduct Proceeding, the RIO will review the situation to determine if there is any threat of harm to public health, federal funds and equipment, or the integrity of the PHS supported Research process. In the event of such a threat, the RIO will, in consultation with other institutional officials and federal agencies, take appropriate interim action to protect against any such threat. Interim action might include additional monitoring of the Research process and the handling of federal funds and equipment, reassignment of personnel or of the responsibility for the handling of federal funds and equipment, additional review of Research data and results or delaying publication. The RIO shall, at any time during a Research Misconduct Proceeding, notify federal agencies immediately if he\/she has reason to believe that any of the following conditions exist:Health or safety of the public is at risk, including an immediate need to protect human or animal subjects;Federal Agency resources or interests are threatened;Research activities should be suspended;There is a reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law;The Research Misconduct Proceeding at any point reveals behavior that may be criminal in nature;Federal action is required to protect the interests of those involved in the Research Misconduct Proceeding;The Research Misconduct Proceeding may be made public prematurely and Federal Agency action may be necessary to safeguard Evidence and protect the rights of those involved; orThe Research community or public should be informed.\u00a0PROCEDURESAllegationAllegation. Any member of the University or other person who chooses to make an Allegation shall contact the RIO (see Appendix A, for additional information on submitting an Allegation).Evidence. Allegations must be supported by Evidence.Misconduct vs. Unacceptable or Questionable Research Practices. Concerns expressed as part of an Allegation may not rise to the level of Research Misconduct.Good Faith. Allegations must be made in Good Faith.Preliminary AssessmentConsultation. The RIO shall advise the DO and Office of the General Counsel of all Allegations.Preliminary Assessment. In the event of an Allegation, the RIO shall promptly conduct a Preliminary Assessment to determine whether an Inquiry is warranted. Preliminary Assessments generally will be finalized within 15 business days.Nature and Purpose of the Preliminary Assessment. The Preliminary Assessment is a preliminary process whose purpose is to cull out a clearly erroneous, unsubstantiated, or Bad Faith Allegation before the Respondent is subjected to an Inquiry or an Investigation. Hence, in conducting the Preliminary Assessment, the RIO is not obligated to do any interviews on the Allegation or to engage in an exhaustive review of all Evidence relevant to such Allegation. However, should testimony be obtained during a Preliminary Assessment, it shall be obtained from Complainants, Respondents, witnesses or other involved parties through private interviews rather than through a formal Inquiry process.Sequestration of Evidence. Any Evidence brought forward by Complainants, Respondents, Witnesses or others or solicited by the RIO during the Preliminary Assessment will be appropriately sequestered.Preliminary Assessment - Standard of Determination. The RIO, in consultation with the DO and the Office of the General Counsel shall determine that an Inquiry is warranted if, in his or her judgment, (1) the Respondent's alleged conduct could constitute Misconduct or Unacceptable Research Practices, and (2) there is credible Evidence to support further review of the Allegation.Inquiry Warranted. If the RIO determines that an Inquiry is warranted, the RIO shall prepare a written Preliminary Assessment which explains the basis for his or her determination. The RIO shall transmit copies of the written Preliminary Assessment to the Respondent and the DO. The RIO shall also notify the Complainant of the outcome of the Preliminary Assessment and provide the Complainant with a brief summary of the Preliminary Assessment.Inquiry Not Warranted - End of Review. If the RIO determines that an Inquiry is not warranted, the RIO shall prepare a Preliminary Assessment report that states the basis and rationale for his or her determination. The RIO shall provide a copy of the Preliminary Assessment report to the Respondent, the Complainant, and the DO. The determination that an Inquiry is not warranted shall conclude the University's review of that Allegation.Bad Faith. If the RIO concludes that the Complainant acted in Bad Faith in making the Allegation, or that the Complainant or any witness acted in Bad Faith during the Preliminary Assessment, the RIO shall refer the matter for administrative review and appropriate action as set forth in Section VII(L) below.InquiryAppointment. If it is determined that an Inquiry is warranted, the DO shall promptly appoint an Inquiry Panel of at least three members, chosen for their pertinent expertise. While Inquiry Panels will usually be composed of University faculty, they may also include persons other than University faculty when the DO determines that such persons have experience or expertise useful to the Inquiry. The DO shall select one of its panel members to act as the Inquiry Panel chairperson.Charge. The DO, with the assistance of the RIO, shall draft a Charge to the Inquiry Panel based upon the written Preliminary Assessment. The DO shall submit that Charge and a copy of the written Preliminary Assessment to the Inquiry Panel and the Respondent at the beginning of the Inquiry.Briefing. Before the Inquiry begins, the RIO and an attorney from the Office of the General Counsel shall brief the Inquiry Panel on this Policy, other relevant University regulations, and legal and procedural issues that the Inquiry Panel is likely to encounter in conducting the Inquiry.Standard for Determination. The Inquiry Panel and the DO shall conduct the Inquiry to determine whether an Investigation is warranted. Based on the Inquiry Panel's report, the DO shall determine that an Investigation is warranted if, in her or his judgment, an Investigation could reasonably result in a finding that Misconduct occurred. To so determine, the DO must find that the Respondent's alleged conduct could constitute Misconduct and that there is credible Evidence to support further review of the Allegation. Furthermore, the DO must also find that there is sufficient credible Evidence that an Investigation could reasonably conclude with a finding that Misconduct occurred, in accordance with the criteria in Procedure Section F(5) below. The Inquiry is completed when the DO makes this determination.Purpose and Nature of Inquiry. Like the Preliminary Assessment, the Inquiry is a preliminary process. Its purpose is to cull out an insufficiently substantiated, erroneous, or Bad Faith Allegation before the Respondent is subjected to an Investigation. Although it is expected that the Inquiry will be more comprehensive than the Preliminary Assessment, the members of the Inquiry Panel, like the RIO, are not obligated to conduct any interviews on the Allegation or to engage in an exhaustive review of all Evidence relevant to the Allegation.Assistance for Inquiry Panel. The RIO shall secure for the Inquiry Panel such special scientific or technical assistance as it requests to evaluate an Allegation.Evidence. All Inquiry Panel requests for review of Evidence shall be made to and managed by the RIO.Communication with Involved Parties. All Inquiry Panel communication with Complainants, Respondents, witnesses and other involved persons will be made through and managed by the RIO.Other RIO Participation. The RIO shall provide training with respect to regulatory requirements, and administrative support to the Inquiry Panel. The RIO will not participate in the deliberations of the Inquiry Panel. The Inquiry Panel may request the assistance of the RIO during its deliberations and in the preparation of the Inquiry report.Timing. The work of the Inquiry Panel shall be completed within 60 days of its inception unless circumstances warrant a longer period, in which event the Inquiry Panel Chair person or the RIO shall notify the DO and the Respondent of the reason for the delay and the date on which the Inquiry is expected to be completed. The DO shall decide whether the delay is warranted. If the DO determines that it is, the RIO shall so notify the Respondent. If the DO finds the delay unwarranted, the RIO shall work with the Respondent, the Inquiry Panel to expedite completion of the Inquiry, but the Inquiry shall continue until its completion if, despite their diligent efforts, it cannot be finished in 60 days. The RIO shall make the report about the delay part of the Misconduct Proceeding Records and notify the appropriate federal agencies.Inquiry ReportContent. The Inquiry Panel shall prepare an Inquiry report that reflects the perspectives of all members of the panel, with the following information:the name and position of the Respondent if the Respondent is an employee of the University, or the name and degree program of the Respondent if the Respondent is a student at the University;the nature of the alleged Misconduct and how it does or does not fit within the definition of Misconduct;a description of the Evidence it reviewed and the sufficiency, credibility, and merit of that Evidence; and,summaries of any interviews it conducted.Deviation from Practice. If the alleged Misconduct involves a serious deviation from commonly accepted practices, Evidence of such practices and an analysis of the Allegation in light of such practices shall be included in the Inquiry report.Draft Report; Comments. The RIO shall send the Respondent a copy of the draft Inquiry report. The Respondent may return comments on the draft Inquiry report to the RIO within seven days of receipt of the draft Inquiry report. If the Respondent comments on the draft Inquiry report, the Inquiry Panel shall consider such comments and make any changes in the Inquiry report it deems appropriate in light of such comments. The Respondent's comments shall be included as an appendix to the final Inquiry report.DO Opinion on Final Draft Report. After making any changes it deems appropriate in the draft Inquiry report in light of the Respondent's comments, the Inquiry Panel shall prepare a final draft of the Inquiry report. The RIO shall send the DO a copy of the final draft of the Inquiry report, attaching any RIO comments regarding procedural questions and concerns. If the DO, with advice from the Office of the General Counsel, finds that the final draft Inquiry report reflects procedural error by the Inquiry Panel in conducting the Inquiry, the DO shall so inform the RIO and shall submit an opinion to the RIO and the Inquiry Panel, within 14 days after delivery of the final draft Inquiry report to the DO, to identify and explain the Inquiry Panel's procedural error. The Inquiry Panel shall either correct the error before completing the Inquiry report, or shall notify the DO in the final Inquiry report or concurrently with its issuance that it does not believe a material procedural error occurred. The opinion by the DO, if one was issued, shall be included as an appendix to the final Inquiry report.Determination Regarding InvestigationDO Determination on Investigation. Following delivery of the final Inquiry report to the DO, the DO shall prepare a written determination as to whether an Investigation is warranted. The DO may request the assistance of the RIO in the preparation of the determination, but shall not seek the RIO's opinion as to whether an Investigation is warranted.Investigation Warranted. If the DO determines that an Investigation is warranted, the written determination may be summary in nature, provided that the DO sets forth the Evidence that supports his or her determination in sufficient detail for the Respondent and an Investigation Panel to understand the basis for the DO's decision.Investigation Not Warranted. If the DO determines that an Investigation is not warranted, the written determination shall be more comprehensive and shall include a detailed statement of why the Respondent's alleged conduct would not, under the definition in these Procedures, constitute Misconduct, or why the available Evidence is insufficient, or lacks sufficient credibility or merit, to warrant an Investigation.Distribution of Final Report and DO Determination. The RIO shall send the Respondent a copy of the final Inquiry report and the determination of the DO.Initiation of Investigation. If the DO determines that an Allegation warrants an Investigation, he or she shall initiate an Investigation.No Investigation. If the DO determines that an Investigation is not warranted, this determination will conclude the University's review of that Allegation, except as provided in Section VII(J) below.Bad Faith. If the DO concludes that the Complainant acted in Bad Faith in making the Allegation, or that the Complainant or any witness acted in Bad Faith during the Inquiry, the DO shall refer the matter for administrative review and appropriate action, as set forth in Procedure Section L below.Notification. Promptly after completion of the Inquiry, the RIO shall notify the Complainant of its outcome and provide the Complainant with a brief summary of the Inquiry report and the determination of the DO.InvestigationInvestigation Panel. The DO shall initiate an Investigation within 30 days of his or her determination that an Investigation is warranted. The DO shall appoint an Investigation Panel of not less than three members, chosen for their pertinent expertise. While Investigation Panels will usually be composed of University faculty, they may also include persons other than University faculty when the DO determines that such persons have experience or expertise useful to the Investigation. The DO shall select one of the Investigation Panel members to act as its chairperson.Notifications.Notification - Internal. The RIO shall notify the Provost and the General Counsel's Office of the initiation of the Investigation.Notification - Funding Source. When the alleged Misconduct involves Research supported by an external (non-University) funder, the RIO shall work with the Office of Research Services and Administration to also notify the source of the funding of the Investigation before the start of the Investigation. Such notification shall include the name of the Respondent, the general nature of the Allegation, and the relevant grant application, grant number, or other identification for the support.Charge. The DO, with the assistance of the RIO, shall draft a Charge to the Investigation Panel based on the Inquiry report and the determination of the DO. The RIO shall submit a copy of that Charge, the Preliminary Assessment referral, the Inquiry report, and the determination of the DO to the Investigation Panel and the Respondent at the beginning of the Investigation.Briefing. Before the Investigation begins, an attorney from the Office of the General Counsel and the RIO shall brief the Investigation Panel on this Policy, other relevant University regulations, and legal and procedural issues that the Investigation Panel is likely to encounter in conducting the Investigation.Standard for Determination. Based on the Investigation Panel's report, the DO shall determine if Misconduct occurred, if the Respondent was responsible for it, and the extent, gravity, and actual and potential consequences of the Misconduct. To conclude that Misconduct occurred, the DO must find:a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant Research community; andthat the Misconduct was committed Intentionally, Knowingly, or Recklessly; and,that the Allegation was proven by a Preponderance of the Evidence.Evidence Review. The Investigation Panel shall examine all Evidence that it deems pertinent to the Allegation. All Investigation Panel requests to review Evidence shall be made to and managed by the RIO. At its discretion, the Investigation Panel may also inspect laboratories and examine laboratory specimens, materials, procedures, and methods. The Respondent will be provided copies of, or supervised access to, all Evidence made available to the Investigation Panel.Testimony.Interviews. When possible, the Investigation Panel shall conduct interviews with the Complainant, the Respondent, and other persons, if any, who have material information regarding the Allegation.Transcript. The RIO shall arrange for the preparation of a transcript of each witness's interview testimony and shall send the transcript to the witness for comment or correction. The witness shall have seven days after his or her receipt of the transcript to deliver comments on, and corrections of any errors in, the transcript to the RIO. Both the transcript and any such comments and corrections shall be made part of the Misconduct Proceeding Records. The RIO shall give the Respondent a copy of the corrected transcript of any interview testimony.Communication with Involved Parties. All Investigation Panel communication with Complainants, Respondents, witnesses and other involved persons will be made through and managed by the RIO.Assistance for Investigation Panel. If the Investigation Panel decides that it needs special scientific or technical expertise to evaluate an Allegation, it shall so advise the RIO, who shall secure for the Investigation Panel the assistance that it requests.Other RIO Participation. The RIO shall provide training with respect to regulatory requirements, and administrative support to the Investigation Panel. The RIO will not participate in the deliberations of the Investigation Panel. The Investigation Panel may request the assistance of the RIO during its deliberations and in the preparation of the Investigation report.Timing. The work of the Investigation Panel shall be completed within 120 days of its inception, or a request for extension shall be made.Extension. If the work of the Investigation Panel cannot be completed in that period, the Investigation Panel chair or the RIO may request an extension from the DO, in which event the RIO shall notify the Respondent of the reason for the delay and the date on which the Investigation is expected to be completed. The report about the delay shall be included in the Misconduct Proceeding Records. If the alleged Misconduct involves Research supported by a federal funding source, the RIO shall notify it of the delay; request an extension; explain why the extension is necessary; and provide a progress report of the Investigation Panel's and the DO's activities to date and an estimate of the completion date of the Investigation.Notice of Stay. If the Investigation is stayed and the alleged Misconduct involves Research supported by a federal funding source, the RIO shall promptly inform it of the date and expected duration of the stay, and of the reason for staying the Investigation.Investigation ReportContent. The Investigation Panel shall prepare a written Investigation report that reflects the perspectives of all members of the panel. It shall include:the name, degree(s) and position(s) of the Respondent;the relevant application or grant number, if the alleged Misconduct involves sponsored Research;a description of the Allegation and the name, if known and not held in confidence, of the Complainant;a summary of the Evidence reviewed, including, without being limited to, an account of how and from whom it was obtained;a transcript of each interview conducted during the Investigation;for each separate Allegation, an analysis of any explanation offered by the Respondent and the Evidence in support thereof;an analysis of each separate Allegation pursuant to the standards set forth in Section VII(F)(5) above;in an Allegation of serious deviation from accepted practices, a description of the Evidence regarding the accepted practices in the discipline and an analysis of the Allegation in light of such practices;a copy of this Policy and any other University policies and procedures relevant to the Investigation.Draft Report; Comments.

The RIO shall send the DO a copy of the final draft of the Investigation report, attaching any RIO comments regarding procedural questions and concerns. If the DO, with advice from the Office of the General Counsel, finds that the final draft Investigation report reflects procedural error by the Investigation Panel in conducting the Investigation, the DO shall so inform the RIO and shall submit an opinion to the RIO and the Investigation Panel, within 14 days after delivery of the final draft Investigation report to the DO, to identify and explain the procedural error. The Investigation Panel shall either correct the error before completing the Investigation report or shall notify the DO in, or concurrently with the issuance of, the final Investigation report that it does not believe a material procedural error occurred. The opinion by the DO, if one was issued, shall be included as an appendix to the final Investigation report.Determination Regarding MisconductDO Determination on Misconduct. Following delivery of the final Investigation report to the DO, the DO shall prepare a written determination as to whether Misconduct occurred. The DO may request the assistance of the RIO in the preparation of the determination, but shall not seek the RIO's opinion as to whether Misconduct occurred.Misconduct Finding. If the DO finds that Misconduct occurred, the written determination must include:the DO's determination that:there was a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community; andthe Misconduct was committed Intentionally, Knowingly, or Recklessly; andthe Allegation was proven by a Preponderance of the Evidence; anda determination whether any part of the Research Record needs correction or retraction as a result of the finding of Misconduct, and, if so, an explanation of that correction or retraction.No Misconduct Found. If the DO does not find that Misconduct occurred, he\/she shall explain the reasons for his or her decision in the written determination, with specific reference to the pertinent criteria set forth in Procedure Section F(5) above.Bad Faith. If the DO concludes that the Complainant acted in Bad Faith in making the Allegation, or that the Complainant or any witness acted in Bad Faith during any Misconduct Proceeding, the DO shall refer the matter for administrative review and appropriate action as set forth in Procedure Section L.Distribution of Final Report and Determination; Comments. The RIO shall send a copy of the final Investigation report and the DO's determination regarding Misconduct to the Respondent. The Respondent may deliver comments on the Investigation report and the DO's determination to the RIO within 14 days of the delivery of the final Investigation report and DO's determination to the Respondent. The RIO shall include any such comments in the Misconduct Proceeding Records.Notifications.Complainant. Promptly after completion of the Investigation, the RIO shall notify the Complainant of its outcome and provide the Complainant with a brief summary of the Investigation report and the DO's determination regarding Misconduct, including those portions of the Investigation report and the DO's determination that address the Complainant's role and testimony, if any, in the Investigation.Federal Support. When the alleged Misconduct involves Research supported by a federal funding source, the RIO shall submit the Investigation report, the DO's determination regarding Misconduct, and comments from the Respondent on the Investigation report and determination, if submitted, to the federal funding source. It may accept the Investigation outcome, ask for clarification or additional information, which shall be provided by the RIO, or commence its own independent investigation.Other Funding Source. When the Alleged Misconduct involves Research supported by a non- federal funding source, the RIO shall notify it of the outcome of the Investigation promptly after the completion of the Investigation and provide it with a brief summary of the Investigation report, the DO's determination regarding Misconduct, and such other information, if any, as it may request in response to the RIO's notification.AppealRight. A Respondent who has applied for or received support from a federal funding source for the Research in relation to which the Misconduct occurred may have the right under federal funding source regulations to appeal a finding of Misconduct by the DO as part of an Investigation to that federal funding source. In addition, all Respondents who are found to have committed Misconduct have the right to an internal University appeal. During appellate proceedings no sanction will be imposed and no disciplinary proceeding will be commenced as a consequence of the finding of Misconduct.External Appeal Record. If the Respondent appeals a finding of Misconduct by the DO as part of an Investigation to a federal funding source, the RIO shall attempt to obtain copies of all documents filed in that appeal.Procedure.Internal Appeal. The Respondent may appeal a finding of Misconduct to the RIO within 30 days of the date of the finding. The appeal must be in writing and must set forth the reasons (whether substantive or procedural) the Respondent believes the finding of Misconduct is wrong. The RIO will submit the appeal to the President for decision.Review and Recommendation. The President may appoint a University faculty member or administrator who does not have a Conflict of Interest and who has not previously been involved in the review of the Allegation under this Policy to review the Misconduct Proceeding Records and the appeal and make recommendations to the President.Request for Additional Information. The President, or the President's designee, may request further information about the Misconduct Proceedings in writing from the RIO. A copy of such information shall be provided to the RespondentBasis for Decision. The President's decision on the appeal shall be based on the Misconduct Proceeding Records, as clarified or supplemented by the RIO in response to any request for further information about the Misconduct Proceedings, and the Respondent's appeal.New Evidence. If the RIO learns of previously unavailable material Evidence relevant to the finding of Misconduct during the appeal, the RIO shall inform the President and the Respondent of the new Evidence. If the President concurs that the new Evidence could materially affect the finding of Misconduct, the President shall remand the finding of Misconduct to the DO for his or her consideration of the new Evidence. The DO may consult as necessary members of the Investigation Panel. The DO shall notify the President within 14 days that he\/she finds the new Evidence immaterial to his or her prior finding or that he\/she wishes to reopen the matter. The President may extend this period for good cause by notice to the Respondent and the RIO.Decision. The President shall issue a decision and rationale affirming or reversing the finding of Misconduct within 30 days after the submission of the appeal to the RIO. The President may extend this period for good cause by notice to the Respondent and the RIOFinal Resolution and OutcomeExoneration. If the Preliminary Assessment results in a determination that an Inquiry is not warranted, or if the DO decides, as part of an Inquiry, that an Investigation is not warranted, or if the DO does not find, as part of an Investigation, that Misconduct has occurred, or if a finding of Misconduct is reversed on appeal, the RIO and the administration shall make diligent efforts to restore the Respondent's reputation. These efforts shall be undertaken in consultation with the Respondent, provided that they shall:be reasonable and practicable under the circumstances and proportionate to the damage to the Respondent's reputation as a result of the Allegation;be consistent with applicable federal funding source expectations, if the Research which was the subject of the Allegation was supported by that federal funding source; andnot affect the University's ability to take action against the Respondent for Unacceptable Research Practices which come to the University's attention as a result of the review of the Allegation under this Policy.Misconduct Found.Actions. When there is a final decision that Misconduct has occurred:the DO, after consultation with the Provost, shall take appropriate actions in response to the finding of Misconduct. Such actions may include:the imposition of sanctions within the authority of the DO or Provost and initiating University disciplinary proceedings appropriate to the finding of Misconduct pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, orreferring the finding of Misconduct to another administrator who has authority to impose sanctions and initiate disciplinary proceedings; andthe RIO, after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel and the DO, shall attempt to correct, and\/or seek retraction of, any part of the Research Record materially affected by the Misconduct. The Respondent will not interfere with the RIO's efforts in these regards.Disciplinary Action. The University views Misconduct as grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, including procedures for challenging or grieving disciplinary action.Degree Revocation. Misconduct which materially affects the original scholarly or creative work included in a master's or doctoral thesis submitted in fulfillment of degree requirements at the University constitutes grounds for the revocation of that degree.Government Sanctions. In addition to sanctions imposed by the University, certain federal funding sources may impose sanctions of their own, if the Misconduct involved Research which they supported.Serious Deviation. The University may take action, including disciplinary action, in response to a finding of Misconduct based on a serious deviation from accepted practices even if an Allegation against the same Respondent based on Fabrication, Falsification, or Plagiarism has not been sustained and the University has an obligation under Section VII(J)(1)(2) above with respect to the unsustained Allegation.New Evidence. If, following a final nonappealable decision that Misconduct has occurred, the Respondent learns of previously unavailable material Evidence relevant to the determination of Misconduct, the Respondent shall send that Evidence to the RIO with an explanation of its origin and importance. The RIO shall submit the new Evidence to the DO. The DO shall promptly consider the new Evidence and notify the President of its impact on the Investigation report and on the finding of Misconduct. The DO may consult with the Investigation Panel as needed. Based on the new Evidence and the information from the DO, the President may reverse or affirm the previous finding of Misconduct, or remand the matter to the DO to conduct a new Investigation in light of the new Evidence. The President shall issue that decision with stated rationale within 30 days of receiving the notice from the DO, but may extend this period for good cause by notice to the Respondent and the RIO.Termination. If the DO terminates the review of any Allegation, an explanation for such termination shall be included in the Misconduct Proceeding Records.Unacceptable or Questionable Research PracticesReferral from Proceedings. During an Inquiry, the DO may find that, while a Respondent's conduct does not warrant an Investigation, it nevertheless constitutes an Unacceptable or Questionable Research Practice. Similarly, during an Investigation, the DO may find that, while a Respondent's conduct does not constitute Misconduct, it nevertheless constitutes an Unacceptable or a Questionable Research Practice. Any such finding shall be referred to the appropriate administrator for review. The administrator may deem further action appropriate, including, in the case of Unacceptable Research Practices, disciplinary action pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, including procedures for challenging or grieving disciplinary action.Discovery and Report. Unacceptable or Questionable Research Practices may also be discovered in circumstances other than a review of an Allegation under this Policy. When that happens, the alleged Unacceptable or Questionable Research Practice should be referred to the appropriate administrator for review and such further action, if any, as the administrator may deem appropriate, including, in the case of Unacceptable Research Practices, disciplinary action pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, including procedures for challenging or grieving disciplinary action.Bad FaithComplainant or Witness.Referral for Action. If the RIO or the DO concludes that a Complainant or witness who is a University employee or student acted in Bad Faith in a Misconduct Proceeding, the matter shall be referred to the appropriate administrator for review. The administrator may deem further action appropriate, including disciplinary action.Discipline. The University views Bad Faith by a Complainant or witness who is a University employee or student as grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, including procedures for challenging or grieving disciplinary action.Inquiry and Investigation Panel Members, RIO.Investigation. If the DO receives a complaint or report that an Inquiry Panel member, an Investigation Panel member, or the RIO did not act in Good Faith in carrying out any of his or her duties under these Procedures, the DO will investigate the complaint or report, with advice from the Office of the General Counsel, and in cooperation with the RIO, if the complaint or report is not against or about the RIO.DO Action. If the DO concludes that the individual about whom the complaint is made did not act in Good Faith in carrying out any of his or her duties under this Policy, and that the failure to act in Good Faith had a materially adverse impact on any Misconduct Proceeding, the DO shall:take such action as may be necessary to preserve the integrity of the review of the Allegation, including, without being limited to, replacing the affected individual, abrogating the Misconduct Proceeding so affected and any subsequent Misconduct Proceedings in which the same Allegation was reviewed, and initiating new Misconduct Proceedings to substitute for those abrogated; andrefer the matter to the appropriate administrator for review and such action, if any, as the administrator may deem appropriate, including disciplinary action in instances of Bad Faith.Discipline. The University views Bad Faith by a member of an Inquiry Panel, a member of an Investigation Panel, or the RIO as grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, including procedures for challenging or grieving disciplinary action.Protecting Participants in Misconduct Proceedings Protection of Position and Reputation. The University shall make diligent efforts to protect the position and reputation of each individual who has, in Good Faith, participated in a Misconduct Proceeding as a Complainant, witness, Inquiry Panel member, Investigation Panel member, Counsel, or RIO, or who has otherwise cooperated in the review of an Allegation under these Procedures. These efforts shall be:reasonable and practical under the circumstances;proportionate to the risk to the individual's position and reputation; andconsistent with applicable funder expectations, if the Research which was the subject of the Allegation was supported by a federal funding source.Retaliation.Prohibition. University employees and students shall not engage in or threaten Retaliation.Referral for Action. If the RIO receives a complaint or report of Retaliation or threatened Retaliation by a University employee or student, the RIO shall refer the matter to the appropriate administrator for review and such action, if any, as the administrator may deem appropriate, including disciplinary action.Discipline. The University views Retaliation by a University employee or student as grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to applicable University policies, procedures, and contracts, including procedures for challenging or grieving disciplinary action.Protection against Retaliation. The University shall make diligent efforts to provide protection against Retaliation by individuals who are not University employees or students. These efforts shall be reasonable and practical under the circumstances and, if the Research which was the subject of the Allegation whose review led to the Retaliation was supported by a federal funding source, shall be consistent with applicable funder expectations.\u00a0APPENDIX A: Information on Submitting an Allegation of Research MisconductUpholding the integrity of research is essential to the mission of research, and to the public investment and trust that supports it. The University of Oregon takes seriously its obligation to maintain an environment of scholarly integrity and to respond promptly to allegations of research misconduct. This information sheet is intended to provide helpful information to individuals who are considering making an allegation of research misconduct.\u00a0What is Research Misconduct?For the purposes of this policy research misconduct is defined as:Plagiarism, the use of another person's words, results, processes or ideas without giving appropriate credit,Fabrication, the making up of data or results and recording or reporting them,Falsification, the manipulating of research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record, or,Any other practice that seriously deviates from practices commonly accepted in the discipline or in the academic and research communities.\u00a0Research misconduct can occur at all stages of engaging in research, including proposing, performing, reviewing or reporting research.\u00a0What is not Research Misconduct?Honest errors or differences of opinion do not constitute research misconduct.Authorship disputes concerning whether one is first, second, or third author does not constitute research misconduct. Research misconduct may have occurred if you feel your name has been left off the paper altogether, and your ideas, processes, results or words have been used without appropriate credit.Unacceptable research practices may not rise to the level of research misconduct but do violate applicable laws, regulations, or other governmental requirements, or University rules or policies.Questionable research practices do not rise to the level of research misconduct or unacceptable research practices, but do require university attention because they could erode the confidence in the integrity of university research.Harassment or relational issues do not constitute research misconduct, but are taken seriously by the university. You can discuss these types of concerns with the Title IX Coordinator.\u00a0Who can I ask for help on what is or is not research misconduct?The university Research Integrity Officer (RIO).\u00a0Who can make an allegation of research misconduct?Any person has the right to bring forward an allegation of research misconduct. That includes any member of the University (faculty, student or staff) as well as anyone from outside the university.\u00a0Who do I tell about an allegation of research misconduct?All allegations of research misconduct need to be communicated to the Research Integrity Officer (RIO), whose contact information is at the end of this document. You can discuss an allegation in person, by phone, in writing, or by any other means of communication. You can also contact the RIO to have a general discussion without having to make an allegation.\u00a0Why is it important that an allegation is made in good faith?An allegation of research misconduct is made in good faith when the person making the allegation sincerely believes in the truth of the information on which the allegation is based and at the time the allegation is made. An allegation of research misconduct can have a serious impact on the career of the person against whom the allegation is made, so it is important that a person choosing to make an allegation give the matter careful thought before proceeding.\u00a0What is an allegation made in bad faith and what are the consequences?An allegation of research misconduct is made in bad faith if the person making the allegation knows about or recklessly disregards information that would negate the allegation. Knowingly bringing forward an allegation in bad faith could result in any of the disciplinary actions and procedures listed in the student code of conduct.\u00a0What happens when I make an allegation of research misconduct?When the Research Integrity Officer (RIO) receives an allegation of research misconduct, the RIO will ask you to come in and discuss the allegation. The RIO will ask you questions about information that supports the allegation, your relation (student, employee, etc) to the individual against whom the allegation is being made, and if there are others who may know about information related to the allegation. The RIO will tell you about your rights and responsibilities, including that if you ask; the RIO must take all reasonable steps to keep your identity confidential. Once you have made an allegation, you are also obligated to keep the process confidential, and to not discuss it with anyone other than the RIO. The RIO, not you, is responsible for looking into the allegation you have made. In most cases the RIO's initial, informal review should be completed within 15 business days. The RIO will then let you know whether the allegation will be reviewed formally.\u00a0What kind of evidentiary support must there be to determine research misconduct?At a minimum, there must be documents, records, lab notebooks, manuscripts or drafts, etc. (for details please reference the definition of Evidence on page two of policy) that show the alleged misconduct. You may or may not have all the records that would be reviewed; however, there must be sufficient documentation or compelling reasons for an allegation to move from a discussion with the Research Integrity Officer to a more formal review process. A formal review process must find sufficient documentation supporting the allegation in order for a determination of misconduct to be made.\u00a0What could happen to me if I make an allegation of research misconduct?When a person makes an allegation of research misconduct in good faith, they are entitled to have the university take all reasonable and practical steps to protect them from adverse actions (e.g., retaliatory actions) that can be directly linked to anyone involved in the informal or formal review of an allegation of research misconduct.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 6: Research, general\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

However, ownership of University equipment is vested in the University of Oregon on behalf of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education, and not in any specific unit or department regardless of whether the equipment was purchased with University funds or donated by an external agency or private individual. Such items need not be listed on the University's equipment inventory to qualify as University equipment.University equipment may be used only in the conduct of University-related activities. Except as required for the proper accomplishment of the University's mission or for the obvious and recognized purposes of an individual unit or department, University equipment may not be borrowed by, or rented or loaned to any person or group for non-University purposes without the prior written approval of the Vice-President for Administration, on the recommendation of the appropriate dean or director.Department heads and unit directors may loan or rent equipment under their stewardship to other units of the University for University purposes and are free to transfer control of equipment to other University units upon the agreement of both unit directors and in compliance with University inventory control procedures.They also may negotiate with equipment vendors for the trade-in value of equipment they intend to replace in compliance with State Board purchasing policies and procedures.When an item listed on the University's equipment inventory is no longer needed or when it is judged to be of no value, the Office of Business Affairs shall be notified. The Office of Business Affairs is authorized to declare such equipment surplus or scrap and to determine how it shall be disposed of according to appropriate State Board policies and procedures.(See also OAR 580-50-035 and FASOM 02.40A[2], 4101, 4102, 4111, 4113, 4150, 4201)\u00a0Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a004\/04\/1986Issued by:\u00a0Vice-President for AdministrationDate:\u00a004\/04\/1986Revision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 4.000 to 04.00.06Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It therefore strives to support and recognize such faculty who wish to continue contributing to their academic disciplines in ways beneficial to the University and the community.This Policy Statement sets forth, in general terms, the rights and privileges of the University's emeritus faculty.Academic AffairsDoug BlandyPolicy Statement:\u00a0\u00a0A.\u00a0 Appointment to Emeritus StatusThe University will award emeritus status to any faculty member retiring after at least five years at the highest rank available to her\/his appointment type; provided, however, that any faculty member retiring, or contracting to retire, before December 31, 2014 will not be subject to the foregoing five-year requirement.The Provost or her\/his designee--in consultation with the appropriate dean, department head, or director--may award emeritus status to a retiring faculty member without regard to the foregoing standard.Emeritus status, if awarded, normally will become effective immediately upon a faculty member\u2019s retirement.\u00a0 Deans, department heads, directors, and the Provost or designee will strive to complete all necessary paperwork by that time.Emeritus faculty will be listed in the University Bulletin, in the appropriate school or department.The Provost or designee, with consent of the Faculty Personnel Committee, may withhold or withdraw emeritus status for good cause, defined as any act that would justify dismissal for cause of an active, tenured faculty member.B.\u00a0 Participation in Faculty GovernanceAn emeritus faculty member may introduce and address motions in the Faculty Senate and Faculty Assembly, as provided by the Constitution and bylaws adopted by those bodies.\u00a0An emeritus faculty member also will retain full governance rights--including voting rights--within her\/his school or department whenever on the University payroll and serving actively in an instructional or research capacity.\u00a0 In addition, a school or department may, if it wishes, grant such rights to emeritus faculty at other times.C.\u00a0 Use of University Facilities and ResourcesThe University will provide, insofar as reasonably possible, working space and academic services to emeritus faculty so they may continue their academic activities.\u00a0 Deans, department heads, and directors will be responsible for assigning such space and services, considering, among other criteria, the likelihood an emeritus faculty member will make sustained, productive use of them.An emeritus faculty member also may apply for University financial support for research, travel to professional meetings, and the like.\u00a0 Again, deans, department heads, and directors will rule on such applications, considering always the typically higher priority of regular, active-duty faculty members.\u00a0D. \u00a0Additional PrivilegesThe University\u2019s Human Resources Department regularly compiles a list (http:\/\/hr.uoregon.edu\/benefits\/retirement\/university-services-available-retired-unclassified-employees) and provides descriptions of all privileges extended to retired employees.\u00a0 Currently, these privileges include such items as staff-rate class enrollments, discounted athletic tickets, and free campus parking when not on the University payroll.In order to encourage the continuing academic and intellectual contributions of emeritus faculty, the University will make every reasonable effort to continue granting to such faculty free campus parking whenever they are not on the University payroll.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0Robert Berdahl, Interim PresidentDate:\u00a005\/01\/2012Issued by:\u00a0Academic AffairsDate:\u00a005\/01\/2012Revision History:\u00a002\/02\/1991 Originally issued02\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.130 to 02.01.1004\/11\/2012 Revised and approved by UO Senate05\/01\/2012 Revision approved by Robert Berdahl, Interim President <signed copy>Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Fund Raising, Generally All solicitation of funds from students for whatever purpose is prohibited unless authorized by the chief executive of the University of Oregon (University):(1) Fund raising refers to activities which intend to raise monies through the solicitation of donations, the charging of admission, or the selling of goods and\/or services. The authority to approve or disapprove all activities and requests involving solicitation of funds or fund raising for whatever purpose on the University campus is vested in the University President. The reference to selling of goods and\/or services herein pertains only to sales by and for the direct benefit of the University, or its divisions, departments or units.(2) For student groups, the University President has delegated fund raising authority as outlined in Policy 571.011(B).(3) The campus mail service may be used only for University fund drives authorized by the University President or the President's authorized representative.(4) The University President has authorized participation by University employees and students in the annual fund drive of the Lane County United Appeal. The President has also authorized fund drives by the University of Oregon Development Fund, with donations to be designated for general purposes of the Fund or for any specific purpose of the Fund.(5) Each University administrative unit may charge admission for cultural activities assigned to its field of responsibility presented in facilities assigned to that unit. Other University fund raising activities by administrative units must receive the prior approval of the responsible dean or vice president. Employee groups shall apply to the Director of the Erb Memorial Union for approval of fund raising activities.(6) In order to eliminate duplication of effort, deans, department heads, and employees shall obtain approval from the Director of Development before approving or engaging in fund raising off the campus.(7) All funds received by University administrative units shall be deposited in appropriate accounts under regulations issued by the Director of Business Affairs. Information concerning the administration of gifts to the University and to the University of Oregon Development Fund may be obtained from the Director of Business Affairs.(8) Sales of products at designated campus locations may be held at times scheduled and approved by the Director of the Erb Memorial Union. Persons or groups selling products at non-authorized times and locations may be subject to eviction proceedings or other penalties.B. Fund Raising on Campus by Student Groups(1) For the purpose of this Policy, the term \"fund raising\" shall refer to those events and activities by student groups which raise monies through the solicitation of donations, the charging of admission, or the sale or exchange of products or services. The reference herein to the sale or exchange of products or services is not intended to include instances of commercial solicitations or commercial transactions as described in UO Policy 571.050.0030even if the sale or transaction is consummated by one or more members of a student group.(2) The authority to approve or disapprove all activities in requests involving the solicitations of funds or fund-raising from students for whatever purpose is vested in the University President by applicable policies (see UO Policy 571.011(A)).(3) No student organization shall engage in fund raising except pursuant to prior approval in compliance with these regulations.(4) The University President hereby delegates his approval authority for student fund raising as follows:(a) All fund raising on the premises, grounds, and in the facilities of the Erb Memorial Union (EMU) shall require the prior approval of the Director of the EMU. The EMU Director may subdelegate in writing all or part of such approval authority to the EMU Board or to the President of the Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO);(b) For all other student fund raising activities on the campus, recognized and registered student organizations shall apply to the Director of the EMU for approval. Authority for approval of such activities may be delegated to the ASUO President by the Director of the EMU in writing;(c) The University President reserves the right to revoke and\/or exercise any of the powers herein delegated if at any time the University President determines that the responsibilities delegated have not been met. The EMU Director shall also reserve the right to revoke and\/or exercise any of the powers subdelegated if at any time the EMU Director determines that the responsibilities subdelegated have not been met.(5) All student fund raising activities shall comply with the following restrictions:(a) The application must state a description of the event, the purpose of the event, where the funds will go, and specifically, the use to which funds will be put;(b) The time and place of the event must be scheduled by the sponsoring group with the University Scheduling Officer at the EMU;(c) Except in respect to lectures or appearances of individuals or groups on the campus officially sponsored by the University for the educational and cultural development of students, funds raised shall not be paid to or retained by any individual. This shall not prevent the leasing of space at the University to sellers of personally handicrafted non-food items, the sale of which adds to the educational and cultural development of students;(d) The only acceptable uses to which funds raised on campus by students or student groups may be put are:(A) For the cultural and educational enrichment of the University community;(B) For the benefit of the student fundraising organization, in line with its statement of purpose filed at the time of registration or recognition as a student organization or as thereafter updated; or(C) For donation to legitimate charitable organizations. The decision of the legitimacy of a specific charitable organization rests with the EMU Director or, upon delegation, with the ASUO President.(e) Except for lease of retail space (see IMD 7.160), facilities located on University property shall not be used for the purpose of private gain (see IMD 7.155) [Editor\u2019s Note Only: OAR 580-050-0035 was no longer in existence as of the governance transition of 07-01-14];(f) The use of facilities must comply with the Oregon State Board of Higher Education statement respecting partisan political activities, September 8, 1970.(Minutes OSBHE Meeting #389-41, 9\/8\/70, p. 685) \". . . the Board has said, and now reiterates, that the facilities, equipment, supplies, and other resources of its institutions must not be diverted to partisan political use. This affirmation is not intended to interfere with the traditional use of campus facilities as public forums nor with the political rights of faculty members and students. Nor is it intended to modify relationships with any of the duly recognized student organizations on campus, including the Young Republicans and Young Democrats, and any other political groups characteristically functioning on the campuses. What it seeks to avoid is the colleges and universities becoming agents of direct political action . . .\"(g) Sponsoring student organizations shall utilize ticket controls and audit procedures prescribed by the EMU staff for all student fund raising events to ensure that student fund raising regulations are met;(h) All student fund raising events involving the sale of products or services must in addition receive the prior approval of the EMU Director;(i) The failure of a student organization to comply with these procedures shall be grounds for the denial for subsequent privileges of use of University facilities to the non-complying organization or to the individuals who have acted on its behalf.(6) In all cases of fund raising, applicant student organizations shall file written applications on the forms provided.(7) Funds raised shall be deposited in the appropriate account:(a) Registered and recognized student organizations using facilities owned or operated by the University for fund raising shall deposit those funds in a Trust Fund Account in the Erb Memorial Union;(b) Funds raised by University-affiliated programs, organizations, or departments, i.e., ASUO and its agencies, EMU programs, residence halls, University departments and the like, shall be deposited in the appropriate EMU account, University departmental account or Trust Fund account;(c) Tickets available from the EMU shall be used by both recognized and registered groups where admission is charged.(8) Student organizations engaged in fund raising shall file a financial report seven days before the end of each term, or within seven days after any fund raising event in which gross receipts exceed $1,000. The report shall provide detail of the amount of funds raised, itemized expenditures, a net balance, and shall itemize the uses to which the balance has been or will be put. Two copies of the report shall be filed on the appropriate forms. One copy shall be submitted to the EMU Director and one copy shall be submitted to the ASUO President. Failure to file a true and accurate report shall constitute:(a) Grounds for denial of future permission to utilize the University facilities to the student organization, to the individuals who have acted on its behalf, and to the scheduling member;(b) A basis for prosecution under the University of Oregon Code of Student Conduct; and(c) Grounds for any other remedies afforded by law for misappropriation of funds or misuse of property.(9) The University President, the EMU Director, or upon delegation, the ASUO President shall reserve the right to review any fund raising event sponsored by a University student group. A representative of the group may be required to meet with the University President, the EMU Director, or the ASUO President to give information about the event.C. Delegations of Authority to ASUO(1) The Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO), acting through the ASUO President, shall exercise the following authority, which is hereby delegated by the University President:(a) To formulate general policies relating to student organizations and on-campus extra-curricular activities;(b) To grant recognition to student groups, or to withdraw recognition from them, as a basis for use of certain campus facilities by said groups;(c) To develop criteria to \"guide\" the University calendar and scheduling officer (who is Director of the Erb Memorial Union) in scheduling campus student events and programs.(2) The ASUO President may exercise the delegated powers directly, or may appoint an administrative body representative of the University community to assist in the administration of such delegated responsibilities. The ASUO President shall notify the University President in writing of the mechanism by which the ASUO President will exercise these delegated responsibilities.(3) This delegation is subject to any policies and administrative arrangements which may be subsequently established by the University President or the faculty of the University. The University President reserves the right to revoke and\/or exercise any of the powers herein delegated if at any time the University President determines that the responsibilities delegated have not been met.(4) The student activity regulations (see Memo 17.030) policies governing the EMU facilities and grounds, and scheduling policies (see Memos 18.010 through 18.080) shall remain in full force.(5) The Director of the Erb Memorial Union is delegated by the University President full authority for the supervision, management, and operation of the EMU, its immediate premises, and its programs, subject to the provisions of any governance document agreed to by the University President.D. Use of University Facilities (1) Users must schedule facilities in advance with the scheduling office, providing reasonable advance notice.(2) All health, safety, fire, and other regulations must be observed.(3) Additional costs incurred by janitorial or other services must be reimbursed to the University.(4) Any user may be required by the Office of Business Affairs to render the University safe and secure from all claims of damage or liability by posting a bond or by other means.(5) Scheduled activities must not disrupt or interfere with classes or other scheduled activities.(6) Any user may be required by the scheduling office to meet other additional conditions necessitated by the nature of the requested use.(7) Use of facilities does not in any way imply that the University endorses, encourages, or approves the purposes of the users.(8) Classes, registration, and other academic uses take priority over all other uses of all facilities. Academic activities are defined as registration, commencement, workshops, and classes of the schools and colleges of the Division of Academic Affairs, and do not include cultural events, athletics, and extra-curricular events, or practice or preparation times for such events.(9) Departments have priority for nonacademic use of space in their own departments for uses related to their own field of responsibility.(10) Responsibility to the University President for proper non-academic use of University space is assigned to the administrator in charge of each facility, or to the Director of the Erb Memorial Union when no single administrator is so assigned. The administrator in charge of each facility is responsible for approval of the use of that facility for non-academic purposes.(11) Administrators and directors of facilities that are scheduled for public events shall make available written guidelines for such use. Users shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such guidelines.E. Use of Department of Intercollegiate Athletics Facilities (1) Events using facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics must be scheduled at that Department's event scheduling office to insure that the date of an event will not conflict with other previously scheduled programs.(2) A contract to use a Department of Intercollegiate Athletics facility must be signed by a responsible officer of the organization, group, or department seeking such use and a certificate of insurance shall be provided by non-University users in compliance with University contract requirements. Users of McArthur Court are also required to inform the Fire Marshal of the City of Eugene that they have assumed full responsibility for strict adherence to the fire laws and code of the State of Oregon.(3) A schedule of rental fees is established by the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics and is published in Policy 571.060(A).(4) Registration and other academic uses of McArthur Court will take priority over all other uses (see Section D).(5) Non-academic athletic uses of McArthur Court have priority over other non-academic uses, except as noted in subsection (6) of this section.(6) The Director of Erb Memorial Union, or the Director's representative, shall have priority during the academic year (September 16 through June 15) to schedule events in McArthur Court at any time the facility is not in athletic or academic use. Any commitment made by the Department of Inter-collegiate Athletics for use of McArthur Court by the Erb Memorial Union shall not be subject to later changes by the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. Adequate preparation time shall be provided by the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics for all cultural events scheduled in McArthur Court, with the amount of such preparation time to be specified in the prior commitment for use.(7) The Director of Intercollegiate Athletics, or the Director's representative, may schedule non-athletic events in McArthur Court, but only in the summer vacation period between the first day following the June Commencement and the day before the first day of Fall term registration, inclusive. The Director of Intercollegiate Athletics, or the Director's representative, may also schedule one non-athletic event in McArthur Court during the Thanksgiving vacation period, the winter vacation period, and the spring vacation period. Any number of performances by one performer or group within 72 hours in those vacation periods will be regarded as one event. The Director of Intercollegiate Athletics shall consult with the Erb Memorial Union Director before scheduling non-athletic events in McArthur Court. The consultation should include discussion of scheduling conflicts, ticket prices, and student admissions. Final decisions will be made by the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics.(8) The Director of Intercollegiate Athletics is responsible to the University President for the proper use of McArthur Court for non-academic use of the facility. The Director of Intercollegiate Athletics may, at the Director's discretion, require users to post a bond in advance or meet other additional conditions (see Section D). If, while an event is being presented, the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics finds such users are not using the facility in a safe, legal manner, the Director may ask the Director of Campus Security to close the event:(a) All users must pay costs involved, including but not limited to costs of setting up stages or supplemental seating, services of custodians, installation of public address systems, and the use of other standby labor;(b) The Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, the Erb Memorial Union and its components, the Associated Students of the University of Oregon and its components, are exempt from any rental fee;(c) The use of the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics facilities by non-University organizations shall follow the guidelines established by the Department under Section B(11).(9) All fund raising conducted during intercollegiate athletic events must receive prior approval from the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics and shall comply with Sections A and B.(10) Signs and banners of materials that do not create a safety or fire hazard may be displayed at any time an athletic facility is open to the public:(a) In areas outside a stadium or arena, signs and banners may not be affixed to Department of Intercollegiate Athletics property or facilities and signs and banners may not impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic at parking lot entries, within parking lots, at or on driveways, at or on facility approaches or aprons or at entry gates;(b) Inside Department of Intercollegiate Athletics facilities or areas signs or banners without sticks or poles, etc. are allowed so long as they do not obstruct the field of vision of other members of the audience.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Given the nature of these investigations, these summary reports cannot risk further exposure of sensitive information, and so can be expected to be minimal in their level of detail beyond the two requirements stipulated herein (namely, a summary accounting of the number of Reports issued and how many of the Reports required notification).Scope of Duty to Report: Any University of Oregon faculty, staff, student, vendor or contractor who has a reasonable cause to believe that sensitive data has been exposed to unauthorized persons must immediately notify the UO Information Security Office.\u00a0 Individuals can either send an email to security@ithelp.uoregon.edu or call (541) 346-5837. Employees who identify themselves and make a good faith report of suspected fraud, waste, or abuse are protected from retaliation, in accordance with Oregon law.

These funds are derived from the overhead generated by grants and contracts performed within the University. The use of these funds is limited to facility renovation and rehabilitation. The Oregon State Board of Higher Education Financial Administration Standard Operating Manual Section 01.26A and Section 0.04D outline Board guidelines for the expenditure of Building Use Credits.1. Building Use Credits are distributed four times a year to provide a relatively timely response to critical situations. Quarterly distribution tends to even out the workload for estimators, designers and other Facilities Services workers who may be engaged in the implementation of these projects.2. Requests from Deans and Directors should be directed to the appropriate Vice-President or to that Vice President's designee. Each Dean and Director should determine how best to solicit requests from department heads and others within that individual's jurisdiction.Building Use Credit requests are to be made by a simple memorandum. The request should describe the need for the proposed project, outline generally the nature of the proposed improvement, and identify the building(s) and room(s) involved. It also should include a reasonably recent and reliable estimate of costs to be obtained from the Facilities Services estimator.3. As soon as a proposal is received, it will be reviewed by the Vice-President to determine the extent and urgency of need and its eligibility for funding from Building Use Credits. Simultaneously, it will be reviewed by the Campus Planning Office to determine the necessity for further review by others, including the Campus Planning Committee. If additional reviews are required or if the proposal presents programmatic questions requiring additional consultation, appropriate referrals will be made automatically and the affected Dean(s) or Director(s) will be notified.4. In mid-February, May, August and November, the President and Vice-Presidents will review proposals collected and cleared during the preceding three months. The amount of funds available for the quarterly distribution will be determined, and the relative priorities of the proposals in hand will be established.5. Projects approved for funding will be identified, and the Vice President for Resource Management will be instructed to request the Board's Office to transfer the funds.Deans and Directors will be advised of the status of their requests. Proposals given priority but not funded will be carried forward to the next cycle, where they will be evaluated in relation to other proposals then under consideration.6. Upon notification of OSSHE approval, the Vice-President for Administration will authorize Facilities Services to proceed with project implementation.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a003\/01\/1985Issued by:\u00a0Vice-President for AdministrationDate:\u00a003\/01\/1985Revision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010\u00a0 Policy number revised from 6.000 to 06.00.03Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Purposes of Sabbatical LeaveSabbatical leave is granted to faculty for purposes of research, writing, advanced study, travel undertaken for observation and study of conditions in our own or in other countries affecting the applicant\u2019s field or related scholarly or professional activities. Sabbatical leave is granted when it can be shown that the applicant is capable of using this period in a manner which will thereafter increase the applicant\u2019s effectiveness to the university and to the state. Only the Provost or designee can approve applications for sabbatical leave.B. Eligibility for Sabbatical Leave(1) A faculty member at .5 FTE or greater with the rank of Senior Instructor I or II, Senior Lecturer I or II, Associate Professor, Professor, Senior Research Assistant I or II, Senior Research Associate I or II, Associate Research Professor, Research Professor, Associate Librarian or Senior Librarian may be considered for sabbatical leave:After having been continuously appointed without interruption by a sabbatical leave for 18 quarters (excluding Summer Session) or, in the case of 12-month faculty, 72 months; orAfter having accumulated the equivalent of 6.0 FTE academic or fiscal years over an indefinite period of 9-month or 12-month appointments uninterrupted by a sabbatical leave.Prior service at the ranks of Instructor, Lecturer or Assistant Librarian, Research Assistant, Research Associate, or Assistant Research Professor when leading to a promotion to a higher rank, may be considered as part of the period of accumulated service for the purposes of the time requirement for sabbatical eligibility.(2) A series of appointments shall be considered continuous whether or not interrupted by one or more authorized leaves of absence other than a sabbatical leave. An authorized leave of absence will not prejudice the faculty member's eligibility for sabbatical leave. Faculty members may be considered for subsequent sabbatical leaves after again satisfying the conditions specified in subsections (1)(a) or (b) of this section. Cases involving mixed terms of service may be adjusted by the Provost or designee, in accordance with the principles set forth in this section. Funding contingent faculty members with an appointment in the Instructor, Lecturer, Research Assistant or Research Associate category are ineligible for sabbaticals pursuant to this policy.(3) Applicants for a sabbatical leave must present a careful statement of plans for the leave period, and a justification of the leave in terms of the criteria stated above. The request must be accompanied by an official application form, a curriculum vitae, and a description of current teaching; scholarship; research and creative activity; service; and other professionally relevant activities.(4) For institutional convenience, and at the initiative and sole discretion of the institution, a sabbatical leave may be delayed by up to two years. In such instances, the faculty member will become eligible for a succeeding sabbatical leave after an equivalently reduced period of years. This section applies to a maximum of 14 consecutive years, covering two possible sabbatical leaves. The same agreement may be agreed to in subsequent 14-year periods.(5) Salary received by a faculty member during a sabbatical shall be calculated as follows:(a) Salary during sabbatical leave shall be a percentage determined under subsection 5 (b), (c) or (d) of this policy of the faculty member\u2019s annual rate in effect at the time the sabbatical leave begins. The percentage is determined by multiplying the faculty member\u2019s base salary rate at the time of sabbatical leave by the average FTE at which the faculty member was appointed during the 6.0 FTE years immediately prior to the sabbatical leave.(b) For faculty on 9-month appointments, salary shall be:One academic year (three terms) on 60% salary determined under subsection 5(a);Two-thirds of an academic year (two terms) on 75% salary determined under subsection 5(a);One-third of an academic year (one term) on 100% salary determined under subsection 5(a).(c) For faculty on 12-month appointments, salary shall be:One year on 60% salary determined under subsection 5(a);Two-thirds of a year on 75% salary determined under subsection 5(a);One-third of a year on 100% salary determined under subsection 5(a).(d) For faculty with appointments in the School of Law, salary shall be:One academic year (two semesters) on 50% salary during the period of sabbatical leave;One-half academic year (one semester) on 100% salary during the period of sabbatical leave.D. Sabbatical Leave ReportsAt the end of the sabbatical leave, the staff member shall submit a report of the accomplishments and benefits resulting from the leave to the department head, the dean and the Provost.E. Obligation to ReturnEach faculty member, in applying for sabbatical leave, shall sign an agreement to return to the University for a period of at least one year's service on completion of the leave. If a faculty member fails to fulfill this obligation, he or she shall repay the full salary paid during the leave plus the health care and retirement contribution paid by the University on behalf of the faculty member during the leave. This amount is due and payable three months following the date designated in the sabbatical agreement for the faculty member to return to the University.F. Supplementing of Sabbatical IncomesTo the extent approved in writing by the Provost or designee, faculty members on sabbatical leave may supplement their sabbatical salaries to a reasonable degree, provided that such supplementation strictly conforms to the stated and approved purposes of the sabbatical leave.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 3: Faculty, general\nOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

ResignationsNotice of resignation shall be filed in the President\u2019s office as early as possible but in no event later than one month before the resignation is to take effect.B. Timely Notice(1) If any appointment of a full-time academic staff member who is on an annual tenure appointment as defined in UO Policy 580.021.0100-135 Section (1)(b)(A) is not to be renewed for reasons other than for cause or financial exigency, timely notice of nonrenewal shall be given in writing as follows: during the first annual appointment, by March 15 for those whose contracts expire June 15, or at least three months' notice given prior to expiration of the appointment; during the second year of service, by December 15 for those whose contracts expire on June 15, or at least six months given before expiration of the appointment; in the third and subsequent years, at least 12 months' notice that may be given at any time. In the event that notice is given to faculty members who are in the first or second year of an annual tenure appointment after the prescribed deadline, they shall also receive 12 months' notice of nonrenewal.(2) Timely notice shall be given to part-time academic staff members on annual appointments on the same basis as to full-time faculty members cited above, except that the length of timely notice for part-time faculty members shall be calculated in terms of FTE years of service rather than in calendar years.C. TerminationsTerminations can be either for cause or not for cause. Policies regarding terminations for cause and other sanctions apply to all members of the academic staff, both those having indefinite tenure and those not having indefinite tenure.D. Termination Not for CauseTermination not for cause is defined as any termination other than for cause as set forth in Section F:(1) Staff Members with Indefinite Tenure:(a) The appointment of an academic staff member with indefinite tenure will not be terminated for reasons other than for cause, except for financial exigency or program or department reductions or eliminations. Before the appointment of any academic staff member on indefinite tenure can be terminated for financial exigency, a bona fide determination will be made by the President that a financial exigency does exist, and that sufficient funds are not available for payment of compensation for the position concerned. Program or department reductions or eliminations may be made by the President, upon determination, pursuant to University procedures providing for faculty and other appropriate input, that such reductions or eliminations are consistent with University goals and needs;(b) Responsibility for the decision as to whether a state of financial exigency exists, and the subsequent decision on actions necessary to meet the financial exigency, or the decision as to the necessity for program or department reductions or eliminations resulting in termination of employment of tenured faculty, shall rest with the President. In considering such matters, the President shall confer in a timely manner with appropriate faculty and other University councils and with the Board concerning the issues involved in arriving at decisions in the foregoing areas;(c) University procedures relating to program or department reductions or eliminations shall reflect a regard for the rights of the affected academic staff member, and such procedures may not be used as a substitute for the provisions of Sections G through S that set forth the procedural protections to be accorded staff members;(d) If a tenured faculty member's appointment is terminated or if the appointment of a nontenured faculty member is terminated before the end of the period of appointment because of financial exigency, or because of program or department reductions or eliminations, the released faculty member's place will not be filled by a replacement within a period of two years, unless the released faculty member has been offered reappointment and a reasonable time within which to accept or decline it;(e) If the staff member cannot be retained either in the position in which presently employed or in some alternate position, maximum possible notice of termination shall be provided the academic staff member being terminated for financial exigency, and in the case of faculty terminated because of program or department reductions or eliminations not demonstrably related to a state of financial exigency, 12 months' notice shall be given.(2) Staff Members without Indefinite Tenure. Appropriate notice of termination shall be provided staff members holding annual tenure appointments as set forth in Section B. If the employment of such staff member is being terminated for financial exigency or program or department reductions or eliminations so as to render impossible the provision of notice as set forth in Section B, maximum possible notice will be provided.E. Other Personnel Actions Not for CauseAs authorized by statute and by authority delegated to the President, personnel may be transferred or reassigned within an institution in accordance with the staff needs of the institution or other units. Such personnel actions should not be considered sanctions for cause unless they result from actions described in Section G.F. Termination and Other Sanctions for CauseThe appointment of a tenured or nontenured academic staff member may be terminated, or other sanctions imposed, for cause. Sanctions for cause include oral or written warning or reprimand, removal from an assigned post and reassignment, suspension for a period not to exceed one year and termination. Sanctions more severe than oral or written warning or reprimand shall be imposed in accordance with the procedure in Sections G through S. Sanctions of oral or written warning or reprimand may be imposed in accordance with University procedures.G. Definition of Cause(1) \"Cause\" shall mean:(a) Conviction of a felony or of a crime involving moral turpitude during the period of employment by the University (or prior thereto if the conviction was willfully concealed in applying to the University for employment);(b) Conduct proscribed by UO Policy 580.022.0045; or(c) Failure to perform the responsibilities of an academic staff member, arising out of a particular assignment, toward students, toward the faculty member's academic discipline, toward colleagues or toward the University\u00a0 in its primary educational and scholarly functions and secondary administrative functions of maintaining property, disbursing funds, keeping records, providing living accommodations and other services, sponsoring activities and protecting the health and safety of persons in the University community.(2) Evidence to demonstrate cause under the standard set forth in subsection (1)(c) of this definition of \"cause\" may include, but is not limited to, evidence of incompetence; gross inefficiency; default of academic integrity in teaching, research or scholarship; intentional or habitual neglect of duty and failure to perform adequately for medical reasons.H. Initiation of Formal ProceedingsIf the President determines that there is probable cause to impose a sanction or sanctions more severe than an oral or written warning or reprimand on an academic staff member, the President shall attempt to reach a satisfactory resolution of the matter. If no satisfactory resolution is reached within a reasonable time, the President shall authorize the preparation of formal charges in accordance with University procedure. The charges shall specifically state the facts believed to constitute grounds for imposition of a sanction or sanctions. The person authorized to prepare the charges shall not participate in evaluating the charges. Charges shall be filed with the President, and a copy personally delivered, or sent by certified mail, to the academic staff member within ten days after the authorization of preparation of charges. The charges or a notice accompanying the charges shall inform the academic staff member of the right to a formal hearing on the charges and of the academic staff member's duty to notify the President within ten days after the charges have been delivered or sent whether such hearing is desired.I. Temporary Suspension of Academic Staff MemberNo restraints shall be placed on the academic staff member between the filing of charges and the President\u2019s action on the hearing committee's report. However, if at any time during the pendency of charges against an academic staff member, the President makes a written finding stating the reason that there is a clear and present danger that the academic staff member's continued performance of duties will be harmful to the University, to the academic staff member or to the public at large, the President may suspend the academic staff member, without loss of compensation, from some or all duties.J. Academic Staff Member's Request for a Formal HearingWithin ten days after the personal delivery or mailing of a copy of the charges to the academic staff member, the academic staff member who is so charged shall state in writing to the President whether a formal hearing on the charges is desired. This ten-day period may be reasonably extended by the President. If the academic staff member requests in writing that a formal hearing not be held, the President may impose an appropriate sanction or sanctions on the academic staff member to be effective as determined by the President. The President shall promptly give written notice thereof to the academic staff member provided, however, that the appointment of an academic staff member shall not be terminated except as provided in Section O.K. Hearing CommitteeUnless the academic staff member requests in writing that a formal hearing on the charges not be held, such hearing shall be held before a special ad hoc committee of from three to five members. Committee members shall be selected in the following manner: the advisory council, faculty senate or other proper elective faculty body shall appoint one or more permanent panels each consisting of ten faculty members; from one, or if necessary, two, of the permanent panels, the same elective body will name from three to five to serve as the hearing committee. The academic staff member and the administration are each allowed one peremptory challenge; a committee member so challenged will then be replaced from the same panel or panels of ten each by the elective body initially charged with impaneling. The committee shall be constituted promptly and shall complete the hearing and its report within 30 days of its constitution, if possible. The hearing committee shall elect a chair from among its members.L. Conduct of Hearing(1) The committee shall set a date for the hearing, giving the academic staff member and the administration sufficient time to prepare the case. The academic staff member and the administration shall have the option of assistance by counsel, both in preparing for and at the hearing. Not less than one week before the hearing date, the academic staff member shall file with the committee any written statement regarding the case. The committee shall review the charges and the academic staff member's statement, if any, prior to the hearing.(2) The committee shall consider the case on the basis of the obtainable information and decide what, if any, sanction or sanctions it will recommend be imposed on the academic staff member. The academic staff member shall have the option of a public or private hearing. The conduct of the hearing shall be under the control of the committee chair, subject to the requirements of this chapter and the procedure of the committee. The committee chair shall have the powers of a hearing officer as defined in Section Y.(3) A verbatim record of the hearing shall be kept. At the hearing, the committee shall receive the testimony of witnesses, on oath or affirmation, and other evidence concerning any disputed facts. The administration shall have the burden of proving its formal charges against the academic staff member, and the committee findings shall be according to the preponderance of the evidence.(4) The committee shall not be bound to follow court procedures or rules of evidence, except as otherwise required by law. The academic staff member shall have the right to appear, to participate in the hearing, and to present relevant evidence to the committee. The academic staff member may be represented by counsel with or without being present. The academic staff member and the administration shall have the right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses. Insofar as possible, the administration will secure the cooperation, for attendance at the hearing, of witnesses requested by the academic staff member. The academic staff member and the administration shall be given reasonable opportunity to submit rebuttal testimony or other evidence. At the conclusion of the testimony, the committee may permit each side to make an oral or written summation; if the privilege is extended to one side, it must be extended to the other side. When the committee is satisfied that all pertinent and available evidence has been received, and that such summations as it deems appropriate have been presented, the hearing will be adjourned. The committee will then go into executive session for the purpose of deliberation.M. Committee\u2019s ReportThe committee, by agreement of a majority of the members thereof, shall make explicit findings based on the hearing record with respect to each specification in the formal charges lodged against the academic staff member. Within ten days following determination of its findings, the committee shall recommend, by agreement of a majority of its members what, if any, sanction or sanctions shall be imposed on the academic staff member. The President and the academic staff member shall be given copies of the findings and recommendation. The verbatim record of the hearing shall be made available to the President and to the academic staff member. A copy shall be made available at cost on request by the academic staff member.N. Action by the PresidentIf deemed necessary, the President may refer the matter back to the committee for further findings of fact. The President shall, promptly after receipt of the committee's final report and after reasonable opportunity to consult with the Board and others, give the academic staff member and the Board written notice of the decision. If the decision is to impose a sanction or sanctions on an academic staff member, the notice shall include the reasons therefor, and when it is to be effective, provided, however, that the appointment of an academic staff member shall not be terminated except as provided in section O.O. Date of TerminationIf the appointment of an academic staff member is to be terminated for cause, the appointment shall neither be terminated earlier than one month nor later than one year from the date of the written notice of the President\u2019s decision, provided however, that an academic staff member having indefinite tenure whose appointment is terminated for cause other than misconduct shall continue to receive salary at the current rate for one year from the date of the written notice of the President\u2019s decision.P. Review of the Board(1) The Board shall review any case involving imposition of a sanction or sanctions on an academic staff member having indefinite tenure on written notice of appeal by the academic staff member. The appeal shall be filed with the Board Secretary within ten days (or within such extension of time as permitted by the Chair) of the date of the written notice of the President\u2019s decision, stating grounds for the appeal, with a copy to the President. The Board may on its own initiative review any case involving the question of imposing a sanction or sanctions on an academic staff member. On receiving written notice of appeal by an academic staff member having indefinite tenure or on notice of the Board's decision to review a case, the President shall forward to the Board Secretary a copy of the charges in the case and the academic staff member's written statement, if any, in answer thereto, and the verbatim record of the hearing, and any exhibits, the committee's findings and recommendations and a copy of the notice of the President\u2019s decision.(2) The Board may review the case on the record only; return the case to the institution from which it came for the receipt of further evidence or testimony; conduct such hearings as it deems proper for its review; refer the matter to a committee of Board members for consideration, including possible hearings, and recommendations; or refer the matter to a hearing officer for hearings and recommendation. The Board shall make such determination of the case, pursuant to its policies, as it deems just.(3) If the Board sustains the decision to impose a sanction or sanctions on the academic staff member, the sanction or sanctions shall be effective at the date originally named by the President, or such later date as determined by the Board.Q. Board's Initiative in Bringing Investigation or ChargesOn any occasion when it appears to the Board that there is probable cause to impose a sanction or sanctions on an academic staff member, the Board may direct the President to determine whether there is such probable cause. If the President finds that there is probable cause to impose a sanction or sanctions on the academic staff member, the President shall have formal charges prepared and proceed with the case as provided in Section H. If the President finds that there is not probable cause to impose a sanction or sanctions on the academic staff member, the President shall transmit such report to the Board, including a full statement of reasons for the finding. If the Board, after receipt of the report, deems that the facts of the case warrant the filing of formal charges, the Board shall provide the President with a statement explaining its exceptions to the findings and may direct the President to have formal charges prepared or, at the request of the president, the Board may direct some person within the University to prepare the formal charges. The subsequent procedure shall be the same as if charges were initially authorized to be prepared by the President.R. No ReprisalsNo employee of the University shall be subject to any reprisals by the University for appearing as a witness or for participating as a member of a committee in any of the proceedings provided for in this division.S. Personnel RecordsNo notation shall be made in the personnel record of an academic staff member of any investigation that has not resulted in formal charges being brought against the academic staff member under Sections F through Q or that has not resulted in the imposition or a sanction of oral or written warning or reprimand in accordance with University procedures, as provided in Section F.T.

The commitment to free speech and freedom of inquiry described in this policy extends to all members of the UO community: Faculty, staff, and students. It also extends to all others who visit or participate in activities held on the UO campus.Free speech is central to the academic mission and is the central tenet of a free and democratic society. The University encourages and supports open, vigorous, and challenging debate across the full spectrum of human issues as they present themselves to this community. Further, as a public institution, the University will sustain a higher and more open standard for freedom of inquiry and free speech than may be expected or preferred in private settings.Free inquiry and free speech are the cornerstones of an academic institution committed to the creation and transfer of knowledge. Expression of diverse points of view is of the highest importance, not solely for those who present and defend some view but for those who would hear, disagree, and pass judgment on those views. The belief that an opinion is pernicious, false, and in any other way despicable, detestable, offensive or \"just plain wrong\" cannot be grounds for its suppression.The University supports free speech with vigor, including the right of presenters to offer opinion, the right of the audience to hear what is presented, and the right of protesters to engage with speakers in order to challenge ideas, so long as the protest does not disrupt or stifle the free exchange of ideas. It is the responsibility of speakers, listeners and all members of our community to respect others and to promote a culture of mutual inquiry throughout the University community.Access to UO facilities and space is governed by a complementary policy, Scheduling Use of UO Facilities.\u00a0Exclusions and Special Situations:\u00a0The UO recognizes the contribution made by the University of Michigan policy statements and practice guides in this formulation of UO Policy.

The workgroup was also supported administratively by Pam Palanuk and Marilyn Skalberg.\u00a0The workgroup developed a draft policy that was discussed with the Faculty Advisory Council, the Deans, and Leadership Council. The draft policy was posted for comment on both the Provost's and Senate websites.The final version incorporating revisions based on the ensuing feedback was reviewed and adopted by the Senate with minor revisions at its last meeting of May 26, 2010.

A written reprimand, a letter from a responsible University supervisor to an employee of the University in which that employee's unsatisfactory or unacceptable behavior or work performance is described and the necessity for change is noted. A reprimand also warns of future disciplinary procedures that shall be taken in the absence of improved performance. A written reprimand is often in order when previous oral or written warnings have not had their hoped for effect. Certain circumstances may warrant issuing a written reprimand as the first disciplinary action taken against an employee. A written reprimand can be distinguished from a written warning or admonition in that a reprimand is placed in an employee's personnel file and retained there for a predetermined amount of time.Procedures:\u00a0When a supervisor believes that issuing a written reprimand to a classified, or student employee, may be appropriate, the supervisor should consult with the Director of the Office of Human Resources to make sure that all appropriate University policies, procedures, and contractual relationships are observed.When a supervisor believes that issuing a written reprimand to a member of the faculty may be appropriate, the supervisor should contact the vice president to whom the supervisor is responsible to make sure that all appropriate University policies and procedures are observed.Formal processes, such as a hearing by a peer panel, that must be made available to employees before sanctions more serious than written reprimands may be imposed are not required prior to issuing a written reprimand. However, employees do have the right to know with specificity what behavior or performance has been found to be deficient and to respond to or dispute the findings, before a written reprimand may be issued. Providing this opportunity to the employee to be heard may be accomplished either in a face-to-face meeting between the supervisor and the employee, with any representatives the parties may wish to have present, or it may take place in writing. In either case, the supervisor must tell the employee what the deficient behavior is, and ask for any information, explanation, or other evidence that the employee may have that might change the supervisor's understanding of the situation. Supervisors have the responsibility to consider any information or contrary evidence the employee may submit before issuing a letter of reprimand.A written reprimand should be in letter form addressed to the employee and signed by the supervisor. It should be delivered to the employee in confidence or sent via the U.S. Postal Service with a return receipt requested, and it should contain the following elements:1. A description of the behavior or performance that has been found to be unacceptable or unsatisfactory. If University rules or policies have been violated, those should be cited.2. A description of the supervisor's expectations for future behavior or work performance or any suggested or required remedial activities that the employee must undertake or should consider undertaking.3. A description of any further disciplinary processes and sanctions that may be pursued if the employee does not improve or repeats the unacceptable behavior.4. The period of time that the written reprimand shall remain in the employee's personnel file.5. Notice to the employee that he or she has the right to place a rebuttal of the written reprimand in the personnel file to be retained there so long as the written reprimand is also present.Written reprimands are documents relating to employee discipline, and therefore are confidential under state law and university policy. It is a violation of law and policy to disclose such personal information to anyone who does not have a University imposed need to know, The University may acknowledge to those inquiring that institutional action has been taken regarding an employee, but the existence of a written reprimand or any of the reprimand's contents may not be disclosed.Issued by:\u00a0PresidentRevision History:\u00a010\/27\/1993 Reviewed and Recommended by President's StaffSupersedes 3\/7\/86 Procedure Guideline: Written Reprimands02\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.01 to 03.04.04Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Determination of Residence(1) For purposes of admission and instruction fee assessment, the University shall classify a student as Oregon resident or nonresident. In determining resident or nonresident classification, the primary issue is a person's intent in coming to Oregon. Intent is inferred from a person's conduct and history as they relate to the requirements of these residency policies. If a person is in Oregon primarily for the purpose of obtaining an education, that person will be considered a nonresident. It is possible for an individual to qualify as a resident of Oregon for purposes of voting or obtaining an Oregon driver's license and not meet the residency requirements established by this policy.(2) An Oregon resident is a financially independent person who, prior to the term for which Oregon resident classification is requested, has both: (a) established and maintained a domicile in Oregon as provided under Section A\u00a0 12 consecutive months; and (b) during that period, has been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student.(3) A student may be considered primarily engaged in educational activities regardless of the number of hours for which the student is enrolled. However, a student who is enrolled for more than 8 hours in any semester or quarter during the 12-month period referred to in Section B(2) of this policy shall be presumed to be in Oregon for primarily educational purposes. Such period of enrollment shall not be counted toward the establishment of a bona fide domicile of 12 consecutive months in this state unless the student proves, in fact, establishment of a bona fide domicile in this state primarily for purposes other than educational.(4) An Oregon resident is also a financially dependent person who is claimed as a dependent by another person who has both: (a) established and maintained an Oregon domicile as provided under Section A(1) for 12 consecutive months; and (b) during that period, has been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student.(5) A financially dependent person who is claimed as a dependent by another person who has not established and maintained an Oregon domicile shall be presumed to be a non-resident. This presumption may be overcome by evidence of the student's long-standing presence in Oregon and demonstration of other factors under Section C.(6) The criteria for determining Oregon resident classification shall also be used to determine whether a person who has moved from Oregon has established a non-Oregon residence.(7) If University records show that the residence of a student or the person upon whom the student is dependent is outside of Oregon, the student shall continue to be classified as a nonresident until entitlement to resident classification is shown. The burden of showing that the residence classification should be changed is on the student requesting the change.(8) Notwithstanding Section B(4) of this policy, a student who is financially dependent on a non-Oregon resident may nonetheless be considered an Oregon resident if the student resides in Oregon for at least 12 consecutive months with a parent or legal guardian who has both: (a) established and maintained an Oregon domicile under Section A(1) for 12 consecutive months; and (b) during that period, has been primarily engaged in activities other than those of being a college student.C. Residency Consideration Factors(1) The following factors, although not necessarily conclusive or exclusive, have probative value in support of a claim for Oregon resident classification:(a) Reside in Oregon for 12 consecutive months prior to the beginning of the term for which resident classification is sought and during that period be primarily engaged in activities other than those of a college student;(b) Reliance upon Oregon resources for financial support;(c) Domicile in Oregon of persons legally responsible for the student;(d) Acceptance of an offer of permanent employment in Oregon; and(e) Ownership by the person of his or her living quarters in Oregon.\u00a0(2) The following factors, standing alone, do not constitute sufficient evidence to effect classification as an Oregon resident:(a) Voting or registration to vote;(b) Employment in any position normally filled by a student;(c) The lease of living quarters;(d) Admission to a licensed practicing profession in Oregon;(e) Automobile registration;(f) Public records, for example, birth and marriage records, Oregon driver's license;(g) Continuous presence in Oregon during periods when not enrolled in school;(h) Ownership of property in Oregon or the payment of Oregon income or other Oregon taxes; or(i) Domicile in Oregon of the student's spouse;.\u00a0(3) Reliance upon non-Oregon resources for financial support is an inference of residency in another state.\u00a0D. Evidence of Financial Dependency(1) In determining whether a student is financially dependent, a student must provide:(a) Evidence of established domicile as provided under Section A(1) of the person claiming the student as a dependent; and(b) The identification of the student as a dependent on the federal and state income tax returns of the person claiming the student as a dependent. Additional documentation to substantiate dependency during the current calendar year may be required at a later time if deemed necessary by the institution.(2) A student who provides evidence that he or she is a financially dependent person under these rules shall not be required to establish a 12-month domicile prior to classification of resident status, provided such a student may not be classified as a resident while receiving financial assistance from another state or state agency for educational purposes.E. Residence Classification of Armed Forces Personnel(1) For purposes of this policy, members of the armed forces means officers and enlisted personnel of:(a) The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard of the United States;(b) Reserve components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard of the United States;(c) The National Guard of the United States and the Oregon National Guard.\u00a0(2) Notwithstanding Section B, active members of the armed forces and their spouses and dependent children shall be considered residents for purposes of the instructional fee if the members:(a) Reside in this state while assigned to duty at any base, station, shore establishment, or other facility in this state;(b) Reside in this state while serving as members of the crew of a ship that has an Oregon port of shore establishment as its home port or permanent station; or(c) Reside in another state or a foreign country and file Oregon state income taxes no later than 12 months before leaving active duty.(3) An Oregon resident entering the armed forces retains Oregon residence classification until it is voluntarily relinquished.(4) An Oregon resident who has been in the armed forces and assigned on duty outside of Oregon, including a person who establishes residency under Section E(2)(c) of this policy, must, within a reasonable time, demonstrate an intent to retain classification as an Oregon resident. Such intent may be shown by returning to Oregon within six months after completing service in the armed forces.(5) A person who continues to reside in Oregon after separation from the armed forces may count the time spent in the state while in the armed forces to support a claim for classification as an Oregon resident.(6) The dependent child and spouse of a person who is a resident under Section (E)(2) of this policy shall be considered an Oregon resident. \"Dependent child\" includes any child of a member of the armed forces who:(a) Is under 18 years of age and not married, otherwise emancipated or self-supporting; or(b) Is under 23 years of age, unmarried, enrolled in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher learning, and dependent on the member for over one-half of his\/her support.F. Residence Classification of Members of Oregon Tribes(1) Students who are enrolled members of federally recognized tribes of Oregon or who are enrolled members of a Native American tribe which had traditional and customary tribal boundaries that included parts of the state of Oregon or which had ceded or reserved lands within the state of Oregon shall be assessed resident tuition regardless of their state of residence.(2) For purposes of this policy, the federally recognized tribes of Oregon are:(a) Burns Paiute Tribe;(b) Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw;(c) Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon;(d) Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon;(e) Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation;(f) Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation;(g) Coquille Indian Tribe;(h) Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians;(i) Klamath Tribes.(3) For purposes of this policy, the Native American tribes which had traditional and customary tribal boundaries that included parts of the state of Oregon or which had ceded or reserved lands within the state of Oregon are:(a) CALIFORNIA:(A) Benton Paiute Tribe;(B) Big Bend Rancheria;(C) Big Lagoon Rancheria;(D) Blue Lake Rancheria;(E) Bridgeport Indian Colony;(F) Cedarville Rancheria;(G) Fort Bidwell Indian Tribe;(H) Hoopa Valley Tribe;(I) Karuk Tribe of California;(J) Likely Rancheria;(K) Lookout Rancheria;(L) Lytton Rancheria;(M) Melochundum Band of Tolowa Indians;(N) Montgomery Creek Rancheria;(O) Pit River Tribe;(P) Quartz Valley Indian Community;(Q) Redding Rancheria;(R) Roaring Creek Rancheria;(S) Smith River Rancheria;(T) Susanville Rancheria;(U) Tolowa-Tututni Tribe;(V) Winnemucca Colony;(W) XL Ranch.;(X) Yurok Tribe.(b) IDAHO:(A) Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho;(B) Shoshoni-Bannock Tribes.(c) NEVADA:(A) Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute Tribes;(B) Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe;(C) Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe;(D) Lovelock Paiute Tribe;(E) Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe;(F) Reno-Sparks Indian Colony;(G) Summit Lake Paiute Tribe;(H) Walker River Paiute Tribe;(I) Winnemucca Indian Colony;(J) Yerington Paiute Tribe.(d) OKLAHOMA: Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma.(e) WASHINGTON:(A) Chehalis Community Council;(B) Colville Confederated Tribes;(C) Quinault Indian Nation;(D) Shoalwater Bay Tribe;(E) Yakama Indian Nation.(4) A student seeking to be assessed resident tuition under the provisions of this policy shall submit, following procedures prescribed by the University, a photocopy of tribal enrollment which documents tribal membership.G. Residence Classification of Non-CitizensA person who is not a citizen of the United States may be considered an Oregon resident if the person qualifies as a resident under Section B and is one of the following:(1) A lawful permanent resident. The date of approval of lawful permanent residency shall be the earliest date upon which the 12-month residency requirements under Section B may begin to accrue.(2) An immigrant granted refugee or political asylum in the United States. The date of approval of political asylum or refugee status shall be the earliest date upon which the 12-month residency requirements under Section B may begin to accrue.(3) A person holding one of the following non-immigrant visa classifications: A, E, G, H-1B, H-1C, the spouse or child of a person holding an H-1B or H-1C visa, I, K, L, NATO, O, R, S, T, TN, U, or V. The date of the issuance of a visa for one of these classifications shall be the earliest date upon which the 12-month residency requirements under Section B may begin to accrue. A person possessing a non-immigrant or temporary visa that is not identified under this policy shall not be considered an Oregon resident.H. Changes in Residence Classification(1) If an Oregon resident student enrolls in an institution outside of Oregon and later seeks to re-enroll in the University, the residence classification of that student shall be re-examined and determined on the same basis as for any other person.(2) A financially dependent student who is dependent on a person who establishes a permanent Oregon residence as defined Section B(2) during a term when the dependent student is enrolled at the University may register as a resident at the beginning of the next term.(3) Once established, classification as a resident continues so long as the student remains in continuous academic year enrollment in the University.(4) A person who seeks classification as a resident under these rules shall complete and submit a notarized Residence Information Affidavit. The affidavit and all required supportive documents and materials must be submitted by the last day to register for the term in which resident status is sought.(5) The University is not bound by any determination of residency except by duly authorized officials under procedures prescribed by this policy including timely submittal of the notarized affidavit.I. Review of Residence Classification Decisions by IRC(1) An interinstitutional residency committee (IRC) is established consisting of the officers determining student residence classification at Eastern Oregon University, Southern Oregon University, Oregon State University, Oregon Tech, Portland State University, Western Oregon University and the University of Oregon. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. A majority of a quorum may make decisions.(2) Residence cases of unusual complexity, especially where there may be conflict of rules, may be referred by an institution residence classification officer to the IRC for decision.(3) Any person who is aggrieved by the institution residence classification may, within ten days of the date of mailing or other service of classification decision, appeal the classification to the IRC. The appeal must be in writing and shall be filed with the institution. An aggrieved person may supply written statements to the IRC for consideration in reviewing the case and may also make an oral presentation to the IRC on a date to be scheduled by the IRC. The decision of the IRC shall be final unless appealed.(4) A person dissatisfied with the IRC decision may, within ten days of the date of the mailing or other service of the IRC decision, appeal the IRC decision to the president or designee of the originating University. An appeal to the president shall be in writing only. The decision of the president or the president\u2019s designee shall be final.(5) A person granted a meritorious hardship exception to residency under this rule prior to July 1, 1990, shall not lose the exception solely because of the repeal of the exception authorization.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 8: Admissions, Oregon residency\nOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Policies and Procedures \u00a0The following policies and procedures embody the recommendations of a resident student\/staff task force assembled in Spring, 1971. The task force's purpose was to examine and propose alternatives to the existing University of Oregon Student Conduct System as it applies to the residence hall students. This system has been in practice since Fall, 1971.\u00a0B. Preface \u00a01) The laws of the state and nation and the ordinances and regulations of the University and local government are applicable throughout the campus, including University residence halls. Residence Hall residents as well as all other members of the student body, faculty, and staff are held accountable to these laws, ordinances, and regulations. Accordingly, law enforcement officials may be called in case of law violations involving residence hall residents.\u00a0(2) The safety of individuals, protection of state property, and maintenance of standards involving public health and sanitation are the responsibility of the Director of University Housing. The Director of University Housing reserves the right to evict students from the residence halls when violation of the above standards occurs. If interpretation of the extent of the Director of University Housing's responsibility is in question, the Vice-President for Student Life shall resolve the issue of jurisdiction.\u00a0Judicial procedures for violations of the code of student conduct shall follow those outlined in policy III.01.01, Code of Student Conduct.\u00a0C. Residence Hall Governance Structure (a) The Residence Hall Association (RHA), the voice of the residents, relays ideas and feedback as a way of communication with University Housing; advocates for residence hall students; stimulates an environment of growth, learning, and development in the residence hall through programming and submits recommendations and ideas regarding policy to University Housing.\u00a0All University of Oregon students who reside in the university residence halls shall be members of RHA.\u00a0(b) The Residence Hall Association Council (RHA Council) is composed of the student chairperson, student vice-chairperson\/secretary, treasurer, student advocate, National Communications Coordinator (NCC), the Assistant Director of Residence Life (RHA Advisor), one residence life professional staff member (Advisor), and a resident assistant for each of the residence halls. In addition, each residence hall will appoint or elect two student representatives to the RHA Council.\u00a0(c) The authority of the RHA Council is delegated through the Director of Housing, and operates within the parameters as outlined in the RHA Constitution, By-Laws and Addendum.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 2: Housing and residence life\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Mistakes (1) Generally.

The University will not allow an Offeror to correct or withdraw a Solicitation Response for an error in judgment. If the University discovers certain mistakes in a Solicitation Response after Opening, but before award of the Contract, the University may take the following action:(a) The University, in its sole discretion, may waive or permit an Offeror to correct a minor informality. A minor informality is a matter of form rather than substance that is evident on the face of the Solicitation Response or an insignificant mistake that can be waived or corrected without prejudice to other Offerors. Examples of minor informalities include an Offeror\u2019s failure to:(A) Return the correct number of Signed Solicitation Responses or the correct number of other documents required by the Solicitation Document; or(B) Sign the Solicitation Response in the designated block, provided a Signature appears elsewhere in the Solicitation Response, evidencing an intent to be bound; or(C) Acknowledge receipt of an Addendum to the Solicitation Document, provided it is clear on the face of the Solicitation Response that the Offeror received the Addendum and intended to be bound by its terms, or the Addendum involved did not affect price, quality, or delivery.(b) The University may correct a clerical error if the error is evident on the face of the Solicitation Response or other documents submitted with the Solicitation Response and the Offeror confirms the University's correction in Writing. A clerical error is an Offeror\u2019s error in transcribing its Solicitation Response. Examples include, but are not limited to, typographical mistakes, errors in extending unit prices, transposition errors, and arithmetical errors, instances in which the intended correct unit or amount is evident by simple arithmetic calculations. In the event of a discrepancy, unit prices will prevail over extended prices.(c) The University may permit an Offeror to withdraw a Solicitation Response after Closing based on one or more clerical errors in the Solicitation Response only if the Offeror shows with objective proof and by clear and convincing evidence:(A) The nature of the error;(B) That the error is not a minor informality under this subsection or an error in judgment;(C) That the error cannot be corrected under subsection (b) of this section;(D) That the Offeror acted in good faith in submitting a Solicitation Response that contained the claimed error and in claiming that the alleged error in the Solicitation Response exists;(E) That the Offeror acted without gross negligence in submitting a Solicitation Response that contained a claimed error;(F) That the Offeror will suffer substantial detriment if the University does not grant it permission to withdraw the Solicitation Response;(G) That the University's or the public's status has not changed so significantly that withdrawal of the Solicitation Response will work a substantial hardship on the University or the public it represents; and(H) That the Offeror promptly gave notice of the claimed error to the University.(d) The criteria in subsection (2)(a) of this section will determine whether the University will permit an Offeror to withdraw its Solicitation Response after Closing. These criteria also will apply to the question whether the University will permit a Offeror to withdraw its Solicitation Response without forfeiture of its Bid bond (or other Bid security) or without liability to the University based on the difference between the amount of the Offeror\u2019s Solicitation Response and the amount of the Contract actually awarded by the University, whether by Award to the next lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder or the best Responsive and Responsible Offeror or by resort to a new solicitation.(3) Rejection for Mistakes.

The University may consider both private and public contracts in determining responsible performance under a contract;(C) If the Offeror has a satisfactory record of integrity. An Offeror may lack integrity if the University determines the Offeror demonstrates a lack of business ethics such as violation of state environmental laws or false certifications made to a state agency. The University may find an Offeror non-Responsible based on the lack of integrity of any person having influence or control over the Offeror (such as a key employee of the Offeror that has the authority to significantly influence the Offeror\u2019s performance of the Contract or a parent company, predecessor or successor person);(D) If the Offeror is qualified legally to Contract with the University;(E) If the Offeror has supplied all necessary information in connection with the inquiry concerning Responsibility. If the Offeror fails to promptly supply information requested by the University concerning responsibility, the University may base the determination of responsibility upon any available information or may find the Offeror non-Responsible.(4) Form of Business Entity. For purposes of this rule, the University may investigate any Entity submitting a Solicitation Response. The investigation may include the Entity's officers, directors, owners, affiliates, or any other person acquiring ownership of the Entity to determine application of this policy.(5) Notice.

Protest of Contractor Selection, Contract Award, and Protest of Solicitation Document(1) The purpose of this section is to require adversely affected or aggrieved Offeror on University solicitation to exhaust all avenues of administrative review and relief before seeking judicial review of the University's selection or Award decision.(2) Types of Protests. The following matters may be protested:(a) A determination of responsibility or lack thereof;(b) A determination of responsiveness or lack thereof;(c) The rejection of a Solicitation Response, unless notice of rejection has been previously provided under Section Z(5) of this policy;(d) The content of a Solicitation Document;(e) The selection of one or more Contractors. A protest may be submitted only by an Entity that can demonstrate that it has been or is being adversely affected by University decision or the content of a Solicitation Document.(3) Delivery. Unless otherwise specified in the Solicitation Document, an Offeror must deliver a Written protest to the University within three (3) Days after the Award of a Contract or issuance of the notice of intent to Award the Contract, whichever occurs first. Protests must be clearly marked on the outside of the envelope with the title or the number of the Solicitation Response and that it is a protest to ensure that it is recognized and recorded.(4) Content of Protest. An Offeror\u2019s protest must fully specify the grounds for the protest and include all evidence that the protestor wishes the Vice President for Finance and Administration or designee to consider. Failure to include any ground for the protest or any evidence in support of it will constitute a final, knowing, and voluntary waiver of the right to assert such ground or evidence. A protest must include a conspicuous marking identifying the type and nature of the protest.(5) A protest of a Solicitation Document may be made only if a term or condition of the Solicitation Document, including, but not limited to, Specifications or Contract terms violates applicable law. The University will (upon altering the Solicitation Document in response to a protest) promptly transmit the revised Solicitation Document to all Offerors and extend the Closing where appropriate. The University may choose, in its sole discretion, to close the procurement process without making an Award and begin a new procurement process.(6) A protest of the selection of one or more Contractors requires the protestor to demonstrate, as applicable;(a) That all higher-ranked Offerors were ineligible for selection or that the protestor would have been \"next in line\" to receive the Award and was eligible for selection; and(b) That the Offeror selected was ineligible.(c) In the case of a sole source procurement, that the Single Seller selected is not the only Contractor or consultant reasonably available to provide the personal or professional services, goods, services, Professional Consultant services as defined in Section B, Construction-Related Services as defined in Section B, or combination of Professional Consultant services and Construction-Related Services.(7) A protest of the rejection of a Solicitation Response must demonstrate that the University's decision was materially in error or that the University committed a material procedural error and that any such error, alone or in combination with other errors, was a \"but for\" cause of the rejection.(8) Response. The Vice President for Finance and Administration, or their designee, will have the authority to settle or resolve a Written protest. A protest received after the time set out in the Solicitation Document will not be considered. The Vice President for Finance and Administration or designee will issue a Written final agency order of the protest in a timely manner. If the protest is upheld, in whole or in part, the University may, in its sole discretion, either Award the Contract to the successful protestor or cancel the procurement or solicitation. Contract Award may be made prior to issuance of the final agency order if authorized by the Vice President for Finance and Administration, or their designee.(9) Judicial Review. Judicial review of the University' decision relating to a Contract Award protest will be available pursuant to the provisions of ORS 183.480 et seq.DD. Right to Inspect PlantThe University may, at reasonable times, inspect the part of the plant or place of business of a Contractor or any subcontractor that is related to the performance of any prospective Contract or Awarded Contract.EE. Invitation to Bid and Request Proposal Negotiations (1) The University may negotiate with the lowest-cost Bidders after determining that that the Bids are Responsive and from Responsible Bidders.(2) The University may, if it has given notice in the Solicitation Document, commence negotiations in accordance with sections EE(3) and EE(4) with Proposers in the competitive range. For purposes of this rule \u201ccompetitive range\u201d means the highest-ranked Proposers based on evaluating all Responsive Proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the Solicitation Document.(3) If the University chooses to enter into discussions with and receive best and final Proposals, the University will proceed as follows:(a) The University will initiate oral or written discussions with all Proposers submitting Responsive Proposals or all Proposers in the competitive range regarding their Proposals with respect to the provisions of the Solicitation Document that the University identified in the Solicitation Document as the subject of discussions.(b) The University may conduct discussions with each eligible Proposer necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section (3), but need not conduct the same amount of discussions with each eligible Proposer. The University may terminate discussions with any eligible Proposer at any time. However, the University will offer all eligible Proposers the same opportunity to discuss their Proposals with the University before the University notifies eligible Proposers of the date and time pursuant to subsection (d) that best and final Proposals will be due.(c) The University may adjust the evaluation of a Proposal as a result of a discussion under this section. The conditions, terms, or price of the Proposal may be altered or otherwise changed during the course of the discussions provided the changes are within the scope of the Solicitation Document.(d) If best and final Proposals are required, the University will establish a common date and time by which Proposers must submit best and final Proposals. Best and final Proposals will be submitted only once, provided, however, the University may make a written determination that it is in the University's best interest to conduct additional discussions, negotiations, or change the University's requirements and require another submission of best and final Proposals. The University will evaluate Proposals as modified.(4) Negotiations.(a) The University may commence serial negotiations with the highest-ranked eligible Proposer or commence simultaneous negotiations with all eligible Proposers.(b) The University may negotiate:(A) The statement of Work;(B) The Contract Price as it is affected by negotiating the statement of Work; and(C) Any other terms and conditions reasonably related to those expressly authorized for negotiation in the Solicitation Document. Accordingly, Proposers will not submit and the University will not accept for negotiation, any alternative terms and conditions that are not reasonably related to those expressly authorized for negotiation in the Solicitation Document.FF. Disqualification from Consideration for Award of Contracts(1) The University may disqualify an Entity from consideration for award of University Contracts for the reasons listed in subsection (2) of this section after providing the Entity with notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.(a) The University may rely upon a disqualification of an Entity by another Public University or exclusion by the federal government or the State of Oregon.(b) In lieu of the disqualification process described in this section, the University contracting for a Public Improvement may petition the Construction Contractors Board to disqualify an Entity from consideration for award of the University's Public Improvement Contracts for the reasons listed in section FF(2).(2) An Entity may be disqualified from consideration for Award of a Contract for any of the following reasons:(a) A primary employee of the Entity has been convicted of a criminal offense as an incident of obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract or in the performance of such contract or subcontract;(b) A primary employee of the Entity has been convicted under state or federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property, or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that currently, seriously, and directly affects the person's responsibility for the Entity;(c) A primary employee of the Entity has been convicted under state or federal antitrust statutes;(d) A primary employee of the Entity has committed a violation of a contract provision that is regarded by the University or the Construction Contractors Board to be so serious as to justify disqualification. A violation may include, but is not limited to, a failure to perform the terms of a contract or an unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of the contract. However, a failure to perform or an unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the Entity may not be considered to be a basis for disqualification;(e) The Entity does not carry workers' compensation or unemployment insurance as required by statute.(3The University will issue a Written decision to disqualify an Entity under this section. The decision will:(a) State the reasons for the action taken; and(b) Inform the disqualified Entity of the appeal rights of the Entity under ORS 279C.445 and 279C.450.(4) A copy of the decision issued under subsection (3) of this section must be mailed or otherwise furnished immediately to the disqualified Entity.(5) Appeal of Disqualification. An Entity who wishes to appeal disqualification must, within three (3) business days after receipt of notice of disqualification, notify the University in Writing that the Entity appeals the disqualification. Immediately upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the University will notify the Vice President for Finance and Administration, or designee.(6) The Vice President of Finance and Administration, or designee, will conduct the appeal generally consistent with the procedures set forth in ORS 279C.450. The Vice President of Finance and Administration, or designee, may share the final outcome of the appeal with all public universities in Oregon. \u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The University educates its student-athletes about the detrimental effects of drug use on health, safety, academic work, and careers. The University must abide by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules. Because student-athletes are viewed as University representatives, the University has an interest in promoting drug-free and healthful lifestyles to the community through its athletic program. The University must minimize the risk of injury caused by student-athlete drug use in intercollegiate athletics. The University must be able identify present or potential substance use and provide treatment and rehabilitation for its student-athletes. The University seeks to maintain a fair and drug-free sport, in which no student-athlete uses or feels pressured to use performance enhancing drugs or any other illegal substance.(2) The University and its Department of Intercollegiate Athletics (Department) condemn and prohibit illegal drug and illegal alcohol use; the abuse of alcohol, drugs and other substances; and the use of performance-enhancing drugs by student-athletes.(3) The program set forth in this policy includes random testing and testing based on reasonable suspicion, educational programs, substance abuse evaluation, treatment and disciplinary measures.(4) Illicit Substances and Performance Enhancing Drugs are prohibited under this policy.(a) An Illicit Substance is one that is illegal for the individual student-athlete to ingest, including but not limited to narcotic pain medications that have not been prescribed and street drugs like heroin, methamphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, T.H.C., or \u201cecstasy.\u201d(b) A Performance Enhancing Drug is one that gives a student-athlete an unfair advantage. The use of a Performance Enhancing Drug is a form of cheating. The use of such a drug also poses significant health and safety risks for the student-athlete and those in competition with the student-athlete. A current list of Performance Enhancing Drugs will be provided to each student-athlete before the start of the playing season or when the name of the student-athlete is first entered upon the team roster, whichever is later. The term \"related compounds\" means substances that are included in the class by their pharmacological action or chemical structure. No substance belonging to the prohibited class may be used, regardless of whether it is specifically listed.(5) The Department has instituted a program of administrative drug testing by urinalysis or the analysis of a saliva sample for student-athletes engaged in intercollegiate athletics. The testing process may be initiated on the basis of individualized reasonable suspicion, pursuant to the random administrative testing protocols outlined in this policy, or on the basis of failing a laboratory-generated specimen-integrity test in the course of a previous test under this policy. A coach or administrator should communicate to the director of athletic medicine circumstances that give rise to an individualized reasonable suspicion. The circumstances giving rise to reasonable suspicion and the source thereof shall be recorded in writing by the director of athletic medicine who shall be the only person to authorize and initiate the drug testing process. This record shall be deemed a confidential record to the extent permitted by law and shall be kept in a secure place separate from and not a part of the student-athlete's educational or medical records.(6) \"Reasonable suspicion\" shall not mean a mere \"hunch\" or \"intuition.\" It shall instead be based upon a specific event or occurrence which has led to the belief that a student-athlete has used any drugs which are specified in Section A(4) and which could have or could have had an effect during a period of organized practice, conditioning, or competition or during a period of counseling for substance abuse or, in the case of steroids, during any period of pre-season conditioning or weight training.(a) Such belief may be engendered by, among other things, direct observation by coaches, trainers, the director of athletic medicine, or other appropriate personnel of physical or mental deficiency, medically indicated symptomology of tested-for drug use, aberrant or otherwise patently suspicious conduct, or of unexplained absenteeism.(b) Such belief may also be engendered by, among other things, information supplied by reliable third parties, including but not limited to law enforcement officials, if the information is corroborated by objective facts, including but not limited to equivocal, contradictory, or unlikely and unsubstantiated explanation by the individual about whom the report is made or information which under the circumstances is credible based on specific articulable facts. Should information be proffered by law enforcement, prosecutorial or probation department officials, the University will use and act upon such information only if it obtains a written agreement that results of a potential test will not be used to prosecute or revoke parole for the use or ingestion of the drug disclosed by the test.(c) Such belief may also be engendered by reasonable conclusions about observed or reliably described human behavior upon which practical people ordinarily rely.(d) Such belief may also be engendered by a previous positive test under these procedures within the preceding twelve months.(7) Random drug testing. Each student-athlete is subject to unannounced random drug testing throughout the entire calendar year. A student-athlete will be selected for testing using a random number system. Little or no notice may be given for a forthcoming test.B. Testing Method(1) The standard method adopted by the Department for testing for drug use shall be through independent laboratory analysis of urine or saliva samples provided by the student-athlete. Urine specimens shall be collected in the proximity of a trained monitor of the same sex who is assigned for that purpose by the Department. Each sample will be collected as a split specimen, such that each tested student will have a sample A bottle and a sample B bottle of the specimen for testing.(2) Results of the test shall be available only to the student-athlete, the head coach in the athlete's sport, the athletic director, the director of athletic medicine and to others who have a legitimate educational, health or medical reason. This record shall be deemed a confidential record to the extent permitted by law and shall be kept in a secure place separate from and not a part of the student-athlete's educational or medical records. Should any challenge to the test results, consequences of the test, or the test procedures be raised in relation to a particular student-athlete, other appropriate University officials may have access to the information in order to carry out their responsibilities in relation to the challenge. A record indicating that a student-athlete was tested and the basis for the decision to conduct the test shall be retained in the student-athlete\u2019s medical file.(3) Each student-athlete shall be provided with a copy of this policy describing the Athletic Department Substance Use and Drug Testing program before the start of the playing season or when the name of the student-athlete is first entered upon the team roster, whichever is later.(4) The substances for which the student-athlete will be tested are any Illicit Substances or Performance Enhancing Drugs and their related compounds and derivative compounds.(5) The student-athlete need not be given prior notice that a urine or saliva sample will be collected. A student-athlete who refuses to provide, including by failure to appear for a test, or impermissibly alters a sample during the testing process shall be deemed to be in violation of this policy and shall be subject to sanction under this policy as if the test was positive. If a legitimate medical condition prevents the production of a urine sample, a saliva sample may be taken with a urine test performed the following day.(6) Sample B Testing(a) Any student-athlete whose sample A results in a positive test may request testing of sample B.(b) The student-athlete must request the sample B testing within 72 hours of being notified that sample A test was positive. The request must be submitted in writing by the student-athlete to the director of athletic medicine. If requested, the director of athletic medicine will authorize the provision of the sample B bottle to an approved laboratory for testing. The Department may initiate temporary sanctions and corrective measures while awaiting results of the sample B test.C. Testing ProtocolThe Department shall follow protocols required by the testing laboratory and the National Collegiate Athletic Association for testing student-athletes that respect the student-athlete\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy, minimize the chances of accidental error or cheating, and preserve the appropriate chain of custody and integrity of urine or saliva samples. A copy of the protocol shall be provided to each student-athlete along with a copy of this policy describing the Athletic Department Substance Use and Drug Testing program.D. Safe Harbor and Self-Reporting (1) Any student-athlete may seek evaluation or counseling by contacting a coach, athletic trainer, director of athletic medicine or psychologist for the Department. The University will share this information only with persons who have a need to know, except to the extent that further disclosure is required by law. No Department sanctions will be imposed upon a student-athlete who has sought evaluation or counseling under this section. The student-athlete will receive counseling and education about substance abuse and undergo a mandatory assessment by a clinical psychologist to discern the severity of the student-athlete\u2019s substance use and other factors that may influence the student-athlete\u2019s recovery as required by UO Policy 571.004.0020-55(F)(3)(a). The student-athlete may be required to attend additional sessions of counseling.(2) A student-athlete may seek evaluation or counseling under this section one time without the student-athlete being deemed to have a positive test result if the student-athlete completes the program required by UO Policy 571.004.0020-55(F)(3)(a) or (F)(4)(a). Accordingly, if the student-athlete tests positive for an Illicit Substance or Performance Enhancing Drug after taking advantage of the remedies in this safe harbor provision, the student-athlete will start at the sanction level outlined in UO Policy 571.004.0020-55(F)(3)(a) or (F)(4)(a).(3) This Policy may not be invoked after a student-athlete is notified of an impending drug test.(4) A student-athlete invoking this policy may be temporarily medically ineligible during any period that he or she is deemed by the team physician unfit to continue participation safely.(5) This policy does not prevent the NCAA from testing a student-athlete. A student-athlete remains subject to sanctions imposed by the NCAA in the event of a positive drug test.E. Drug Education and Counseling ServicesThe Athletic Department shall provide a program of drug information and counseling referral for student-athletes.F. Positive Test Results Sanctions(1) The director of athletic medicine, the athletic director, the head coach, and other appropriate personnel shall review a positive test result and shall, bearing in mind the type of drugs identified, the recency of use, and the medical, safety and performance-enhancing effects of the use, formulate an appropriate program for the student-athlete. Such program shall include abstention from further use and periodic retesting and may include counseling, reduced playing time, and withdrawal from drills, scrimmages, or competitions. The program shall also describe potential sanctions for repeated use or abuse of substances for which tests are conducted. However, a student-athlete may be dismissed from the team and lose all athletic financial aid, beginning with the next academic term after a single positive test result.(2) Repeated positive tests, admissions, or other information that disclose continued use of Illicit Substances or Performance Enhancing Drugs may cause a student-athlete to be dismissed from the team and lose all athletic financial aid beginning with the next academic term. A student-athlete who refuses to provide a urine or saliva sample as part of the testing process, by failing to appear for a test or otherwise, shall be deemed to have provided information that discloses use of Illicit Substances or Performance Enhancing Drugs.(3) Illicit Substances. If the student-athlete tests positive for the use of an Illicit Substance, the sanctions will be consistent with the sanctions listed in this subsection. These sanctions define the least severe sanctions that may be taken after each positive test. Notwithstanding the sanctions outlined in this subsection, if concluded to be appropriate, a student-athlete may be dismissed from the team and lose all athletic financial aid after a single positive test.(a) First positive test. The student-athlete will receive counseling and education about substance abuse. The student-athlete will undergo a mandatory assessment by a clinical psychologist to discern the severity of the student-athlete\u2019s substance use and other factors that may influence the student-athlete\u2019s recovery. If concluded to be necessary, the student-athlete may be referred for additional sessions of counseling.(b) Second positive test for the same or a different Illicit Substance. A formal behavior modification contract will be produced by the director of athletic medicine. The athletic director shall have discretion to approve the behavior modification contract or require that terms be added. Upon approval by the athletic director, the behavior modification contract shall be reviewed and signed by the head coach and the student-athlete. A copy of the behavior modification contract will be kept on file with the director of athletic medicine. The behavior modification contract will define the behaviors expected from the student-athlete and the consequences for noncompliance.(c) Third positive test for the same or a different Illicit Substance. The student-athlete will be immediately ineligible for competition. The student-athlete will remain ineligible until he or she has missed the equivalent of 50% of a season.(d) Forth positive test for the same or a different Illicit Substance. The student-athlete will be dismissed from the team and lose all athletic financial aid, beginning with the next academic term, to the extent permitted under NCAA rules.(4) Performance Enhancing Drugs. If a student-athlete tests positive for the use of a Performance Enhancing Drug, the sanctions will be consistent with the sanctions listed in this subsection. These sanctions define the least severe sanctions that may be taken after each positive test. Notwithstanding the sanctions outlined in this subsection, if concluded to be appropriate, a student-athlete may be dismissed from the team and lose all athletic financial aid after a single positive test.(a) First positive test. A student-athlete who tests positive for the use of a Performance Enhancing Drug is ineligible to represent the University in intercollegiate competition during the time period starting with the date of the positive drug test and ending one calendar year later. In addition, the director of athletic medicine will determine a management plan for the student-athlete which will include education or counseling. A first positive test result for a Performance Enhancing Drug is also deemed to be a first positive test for an Illicit Substance.(b) Second positive test for the same or a different Performance Enhancing Drug. A student-athlete who tests positive for the use of the same or a different Performance Enhancing Drug shall be declared permanently ineligible for intercollegiate competition. The student shall be immediately and permanently dismissed from the team and all athletic financial aid shall be terminated beginning with the next academic term, to the extent permitted under NCAA rules.(5) Failure of a student-athlete to comply with a treatment plan, management plan or behavior modification contract mandated under this policy may result in immediate suspension from all practices, games and Department functions until the director of athletic medicine determines sustained compliance with the treatment plan, management plan or behavior modification contract. If the director of athletic medicine determines that the student-athlete is not in compliance after one competitive season for the sport, the student-athlete will be immediately dismissed from the team and all athletic financial aid shall be terminated beginning with the next academic term, to the extent permitted under NCAA rules.(6) Selling or Providing Illegal Drugs. Any student-athlete convicted of or otherwise found responsible for selling or providing an illegal drug to another person is subject to immediate and permanent dismissal from any team on which the student-athlete participates and, to the extent permitted under NCAA rules, the termination of any athletic financial aid.(7) A student-athlete who loses athletic financial aid under this policy may appeal that decision under the established procedures regarding non-renewal of financial aid.G. Records Security (1) The purpose of the administrative testing program established by this policy does not include enforcement of the criminal laws or the Student Conduct Code.(2) The University in conducting the testing program is not acting in aid of, or as an agent for, law enforcement officials, nor are those administering the tests acting as, for, or on behalf of the Division of Student Affairs. The Student Conduct Code applies to drug or substance use by a student-athlete only under the same circumstances as other students.(3) Test results are part of a student's educational and medical records protected from disclosure under state and federal law. However, records may be subject to disclosure pursuant to a lawfully issued subpoena or court order. In such an instance, the University will take reasonable steps to notify the record-subject in advance of compliance with any such subpoena or order. The University or the record-subject may move the court or agency to quash any portion of the subpoena which pertains to drug testing records or to withdraw or narrow any such court order.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 7: Intercollegiate athletics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(Senate action on 1\/17\/18 via motion US 17\/18-01.)Policy:\u00a0The expedited tenure\u00a0process is not appropriate for faculty members or academic administrators\u00a0who are currently employed and\/or under contract at the University of Oregon.\u00a0If a unit faculty votes to hire a new faculty member at the rank of full professor,\u00a0and votes to recommend indefinite tenure to the candidate based on the candidates\u2019 application materials, and the Provost and the Dean of the relevant School or College agrees with the hiring and tenure recommendation of the unit, then the faculty and the Dean can forward the possible new faculty member\u2019s dossier to the Faculty Personnel Committee for an expedited promotion and tenure review; and\u00a0The expedited review shall be conducted by a subcommittee of the Faculty Personnel Committee (FPC) consisting of five members (with one member selected as chair by the subcommittee) and will include three FPC members from the College of Arts and Sciences (one from each division) and two FPC members from\u00a0 the other schools and colleges. The members of this committee, to be called the Expedited Tenure Review Committee (ETRC), will be elected annually by the FPC. The ERTC will be composed with attention to equity, diversity and inclusion. \u00a0ETRC members shall recuse themselves from the consideration of tenure cases in their unit. Vacancies, including those that arise from recusals, will be filled by the FPC chair after consulting the FPC membership; and\u00a0The ETRC will be \u201con call\u201d through the academic year and the summer term to review cases and make recommendations to the Provost. The ETRC will meet at least once each fall with the Provost to discuss process and standards and select a chair for the year; and\u00a0The ETRC, upon completion of its review, will report their recommendation to the hiring unit, and will provide the compiled tenure dossier, which shall include all information upon which they have made their recommendation, to the hiring unit. Relevant members of the unit, as specified by the unit governance documents, shall have five business days after receipt of the dossier to change their vote for indefinite tenure and to notify the ETRC about any such changes. \u00a0The ETRC shall consider any changes to the unit tenure vote and either recommend to the Provost that the possible new faculty member should receive indefinite tenure and the rank of full professor or require that the faculty member be reviewed by the full promotion and tenure process; and\u00a0The ETRC will determine what materials should be considered in their review, but such materials must include at a minimum the following: candidate\u2019s cv, all relevant research materials, a quantitative assessment of the candidate\u2019s work and impact if available, and at least five external evaluations, three of which may be letters from application process and at least two of which must be external evaluations (by letter or by a phone call conducted by a member of the ETRC). The latter two evaluators must be selected by the committee from a list of possible evaluators prepared by the hiring department(s) and not including anyone listed among the candidate\u2019s references.\u00a0The ETRC will carefully document any non-written evaluations for inclusion in the tenure dossier.\u00a0The ETRC may request other information as it sees fit through the dean of the relevant school or college.\u00a0Failure of a dean to provide requested information may result in the ETRC requiring the candidate be reviewed by the full promotion and tenure process.\u00a0Materials collected for each review will be available to all members of the FPC and FPC members may provide comments to the ETRC until the ETRC concludes its deliberations and makes its decision on the case.\u00a0The FPC shall be responsible for tracking when an individual is awarded tenure via the expedited process and will include in their annual report to the Senate the number of cases considered by the ETRC and the number of cases in which tenure was awarded via the expedited process.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 2: Appointments, promotion and tenure\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Any SPCC decision impacting the appropriation of the Incidental Fee shall require ASUO consideration and recommendation, in accordance with the Incidental Fee Authorization policy.\u00a0Specifically, the SPCC shall review capital projects presented by the university and recommend whether each such project should be approved and the relative priority of each such project. The committee may also request consideration of additional projects or project modifications that the committee or student government identifies independently.\u00a0The SPCC shall be comprised of seven members: three (3) students appointed by the ASUO President no later than September 1 of each year; one (1) representative of the Student Senate, to be designated by the Student Senate no later than October 1 of each year; one (1) graduate student representative, to be appointed by the ASUO President no later than September 1 of each year; one (1) at-large member elected by the student body during the prior year\u2019s regular spring ASUO elections, and; the ASUO Vice President, who shall serve as an ex-officio non-voting member, except in case of a tie, when the ASUO Vice President shall cast the tie-breaking vote. In the event the seat of the at-large elected representative becomes vacant, the ASUO President shall appoint a replacement in accordance with the ASUO governing documents. The ASUO President (or designee) shall provide a list of SPCC members to the University President (or designee) no later than October 15 each year.\u00a0\u00a0The SPCC shall be responsible for formulating and revising its own operating bylaws, in accordance with ASUO governance documents, University policy, and applicable law. These bylaws must not conflict with or impede the university\u2019s capital construction process. All student projects will follow university processes and procedures, including Campus Planning Committee, Design Review Board, and any other formal parts of the capital project process.\u00a0The ASUO President shall convey the recommendations of the SPCC in writing to the University President (or designee). The University President shall review the recommendation(s) of the SPCC with the ASUO President prior to the deadline for submitting recommendation(s) to the University\u2019s Board of Trustees. If the University President does not agree with the recommendations of the SPCC, the University President and ASUO President shall make good a faith effort to reach an agreement. This agreement may be conveyed in the form of a memorandum of understanding or other form of written communication deemed appropriate. If agreement is not reached, the University President and the ASUO President may submit their recommendations for the allocation of the Student Building Fee to the Board of Trustees separately. The University President shall disclose that agreement has not been reached with the ASUO President.\u00a0Nothing in this policy is intended to preclude the University President from submitting capital construction projects to the Board of Trustees or limit any of the authority the Board reserved for itself in PRDA \u00a7 1.7.4 (i.e. capital projects exceeding $5 million).Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 3: Tuition and student fees\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Public Activities(1) Although there is no prohibition against active participation by University employees in various community and public affairs, it is expected that time given to such activities shall not interfere with the duties of the employees concerned.(2) No employee shall take action that might be construed as committing the institution or the Board to a position on public issues.B. Candidates for Public Office(1) In accordance with the Oregon Constitution, it is University policy to allow employees to seek political office and to serve in the event of election. Before an employee shall become a candidate for any public office, whether for a salaried or nonsalaried position, the employee is expected to consult with the President.(2) Political activity shall in no way interfere with the performance of the major duties prescribed by the University.(3) Because circumstances under which a campaign is conducted will vary widely depending on the nature of the elective office and the extent of opposition, the determination of whether an employee may continue full-time duties while conducting or engaged in a campaign rests with the employee's President. In the event of election to the State Legislature, an employee normally will be placed on leave of absence without pay during the period of full-time responsibility. If elected or appointed to a full-time salaried office, the employee may be placed on leave of absence without pay during the term of office or may be required to resign.C. Relationships with State Government(1) Except for the President and designees, no employee of the University is authorized to represent the University to the Legislature, its members or committees, to the Office of the Governor, and to the Executive Department and its Divisions.(2) Nothing in this policy shall be construed as inhibiting an employee of the University from exercising the right of citizenship in a personal capacity, or be construed as inhibiting any employee of the University from appearing before a body of state government identified in this policy in response to a request from that body.(3) Faculty members are encouraged to visit the Legislative Sessions and Hearings with students in the interests of furthering the effectiveness of organized class work, or to respond to requests from the Legislature for establishment and maintenance of special involvements such as student intern programs.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume V: Human Resources\nChapter 11: Human resources, other\nRelated Resources:\u00a0Chapter 260 of the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) controls political campaigning by public employees.\u00a0 Available here: https:\/\/www.oregonlegislature.gov\/bills_laws\/ors\/ors260.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The University shall promptly adopt and publicize, and shall maintain, a procedure for redressing the grievances of persons who are subject to discrimination. Section B to Section FF do not apply to claims of discrimination in employment, promotion, tenure or termination of employment except student employment as provided in Section M(1).D. Appointment of Compliance Officer The Chancellor shall appoint a compliance officer who shall be responsible directly to the Chancellor for:(1) General oversight of Department efforts to comply with ORS 659.150 and 659.155, and for bringing to the attention of the Chancellor any needed changes in Board rules or policies relating to compliance with such statutes.(2) Working with presidents or division heads, or their designees, as requested, in assisting institutions and divisions in the development and maintenance of effective policies and rules relating to compliance with ORS 659.150 and 659.155, and in evaluating the effectiveness of their application.(3) Evaluating periodically the evidence as to compliance with ORS 659.150 and 659.155, and reporting such evaluations to the Chancellor, presidents and division heads concerned.(4) Carrying other responsibilities relating to assuring compliance with ORS 659.150 and 659.155 as may be assigned by the Chancellor.E. Admissions (1) No person shall, on a prohibited basis, be denied admission or be subject to discrimination in admission.(2) Each school, department or college in the University, that has an independent admissions process, or one supplementary to the University admissions process, is considered an administratively separate unit for admission purposes and may not discriminate unreasonably on any of the prohibited bases (i.e., age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, national origin, race, religion).(3) No test or other criterion for admission that unreasonably differentiates among individuals on a prohibited basis shall be used, unless the use of the test or criterion is shown to be a valid means of predicting success in the educational program, and other suitable tests or criteria not having such an adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.(4) No preference in admission shall be given one person over another on a prohibited basis, such as by ranking individuals on a prohibited basis.(5) Numerical limitations on the number or proportion of persons to be admitted may not be established on a prohibited basis.(6) In making admissions decisions, the University:(a) Shall not apply any rule concerning marital, parental or family status of an applicant or student that treats individuals differently on a prohibited basis;(b) Shall not consider pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom to determine eligibility for admission, unless on a case-by-case basis the health of an individual relates directly to the capacity to participate effectively in activities necessary to the program. Such determinations shall be treated no differently than other health conditions;(c) Shall not make pre-admission inquiry as to marital status of an applicant for admission, including whether such applicant is \"Miss\" or \"Mrs.\"F. Recruitment (1) In recruiting students, the University shall not unreasonably differentiate among individuals on a prohibited basis.(2) The University shall not recruit primarily or exclusively from schools or other educational institutions that admit students predominantly on a prohibited basis, if such actions result in discriminatory enrollment.G. Educational Programs and Activities (1) No individual shall, on a prohibited basis, be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other educational program or activity operated by the University, or, although not operated by the University, is required of students by the University.(2) In providing aid, benefit, or service to students, the University shall not discriminate on a prohibited basis, except where differential treatment is not unreasonable within the meaning of ORS 659.150 and 659.155.H.

They may also be separated by sex within classes during participation in bodily contact sports. Curricula serving the particular activity needs of males or those of females may be offered, but enrollment may not be restricted on a prohibited basis.(2) Physical education classes may use different standards for measuring skills and progress if use of a single standard would, on a prohibited basis, have an adverse effect on persons, or on the likelihood of their participation.(3) Theater, dance, choral music and other artistic activities may differentiate participants in roles on the basis of sex if necessary to achieve specific artistic objectives.I. Counseling and Use of Appraisal and Counseling Materials(1) The University shall neither discriminate among students on a prohibited basis in assistance rendered in making educational or career choices, or in the counseling and guidance services offered, nor among applicants for admission if such services are offered.(2) Students or applicants for admission involved in the appraisal or counseling process shall not be differentiated on a prohibited basis by the nature of tests and materials used, except or unless differentiated materials covering the same occupations and interest areas are shown to be essential to the elimination of bias with respect to age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, national origin, race and religion.J. HousingThe University shall not, on a prohibited basis, unreasonably differentiate among applicants or students in housing fees charged or services or benefits offered in housing, except as provided below:(1) Separate housing may be provided for the separate sexes.(2) Available housing may be divided between men and women on the basis of the number of applicants for housing of each sex, provided the housing is comparable in quality and cost.(3) Qualifications for occupancy of family housing shall be the same for married women students as for married men students, and shall be the same for single parents of either sex.K. Comparable Facilities (1) Separate rest rooms, change and locker rooms, showers, baths and toilet facilities, provided on the basis of sex, must be reasonably comparable in convenience and quality.(2) The University and divisions should ensure reasonable access by persons with disabilities to facilities including classrooms, locker rooms, showers and rest rooms.L.

Athletic scholarships, unlike nonathletic scholarships, may be awarded on the basis of sex, inasmuch as separate teams are permitted.M. Employment Assistance to Students (1) The University and divisions shall assure that nondiscriminatory policies are followed in student employment. Discrimination grievances arising out of student employment shall be addressed using the procedures required by or described in Section C and Section R through Section EE.(2) The University and divisions shall not assist prospective employers or agencies known by them to discriminate on a prohibited basis in their recruitment, hiring or employment practices.

Health and Insurance Benefits and Services(1) The University or any constituents, including student groups, may not offer to students a medical, hospital or accident policy, plan, benefit or service that unreasonably discriminates on a prohibited basis.(2) The University may offer a benefit or service even though it is not used by the same proportion of students of one group as of another. When full-coverage health services are provided, basic gynecological care shall be provided.(3) Whatever limits a health service establishes as to services offered shall not differentiate unreasonably among individuals on a prohibited basis.O. Marital or Parental Status (1) Any rule dealing with marital, parental or family status must be applied equally to men and women students.(2)(a) The University and divisions shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from an educational program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity;(b) The University and divisions may require the student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation in the normal educational program or activity so long as certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician. In such cases, the University may require reasonable efforts by the affected individual to secure appropriate health insurance coverage or to hold the University harmless from consequences flowing from error or misdiagnosis on the part of the student\u2019s physician.(3) Pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or related conditions must be treated the same as other temporary disabilities. Whatever benefits and services are available to students who are temporarily disabled, including medical services and leaves of absence, shall apply equally to pregnancy-related disabilities.(4) The University and divisions may maintain, on an elective basis only, educational programs or activities specifically for pregnant students. When such programs and activities are maintained, the University and divisions shall assure that they are comparable in quality to those offered nonpregnant students.(5) The University and divisions shall consider pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions a justification for a leave of absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.P. Athletics (1) No person shall, on a prohibited basis, be excluded from participation in or be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any intercollegiate, club, recreational or intramural athletics offered by the University, except as provided below:(a) Intercollegiate and club sports, where team selection is based on competitive skills, may have separate teams based on sex or physical disability;(b) If only one team is offered in a noncontact sport, students may not, on a prohibited basis, be excluded from trying out;(c) If only one team is offered in a bodily contact sport, members of the excluded sex need not be allowed to try out;(d) Noncontact intramural and recreational sports, where team selection is not competitive, must be offered on a coeducational basis. Separate teams may be offered for contact intramural and recreational sports.(2) The University shall not, in the provision of athletic opportunities, unreasonably differentiate among individuals on a prohibited basis.(3) In assessing the total athletic opportunity provided, the University shall be guided by regulations implementing Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and shall assess at least the following:(a) Appropriateness of equipment and supplies;(b) Games and practice schedules;(c) Travel and per diem allowances;(d) Opportunity for coaching and academic tutoring;(e) Coaches and tutors;(f) Locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities;(g) Medical and training services;(h) Housing and dining facilities and services;(i) Publicity.(4) Athletic expenditures need not be equal but the pattern of expenditures must not result in a disparate effect on opportunity. The University may not discriminate in the provision of necessary equipment, supplies, facilities, and publicity for sports programs.Q. Textbooks and Curricular Materials Nothing herein either prohibits or requires the use of any particular textbook or curricular materials. If, however, materials are found upon investigation to exert a discriminatory impact on the basis of age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, national origin, race or religion, the University and divisions shall make a reasonable effort to make available supplemental alternative nondiscriminatory materials.R. Procedure for Reporting Discrimination(1) The University shall make available a person to serve as a grievance counselor to assist students and others in formulating and following up complaints of alleged prohibited discrimination.(2) The University shall designate a compliance officer to receive complaints of alleged noncompliance with Section C.

Investigation of Complaints (1) Within 30 days after receipt of the complaint, the University shall complete such investigation of the matter as it deems necessary, order the correction of any noncompliance found to exist or to have occurred and transmit a report of the findings of its investigation and corrective action to the President, to the complainant and to the compliance officer with whom the complaint was filed.(2) The 30-day period allowed under section (1) of this rule may be extended for not more than 30 days upon application by the University or division and approval of the President.U. Appeal to the Chancellor (1) In the judgment of the Chancellor, whenever an institution or division fails to conduct a satisfactory investigation, fails to take appropriate corrective action or fails to make reports on complaints within the 30-day period where no extension has been granted or within the period allowed under the extension, the Chancellor shall initiate an investigation of the complaint.(2) Whenever the complainant is not satisfied with the report, or if no report is made within the time allotted, the complainant may request in writing that a hearing be held on the complaint. The request shall state the reasons for dissatisfaction. The request shall be filed with the compliance officer who shall forward a copy promptly to the Chancellor. On receipt of the request, the Chancellor may order the hearing; provided, however, that the Chancellor may review the report and other information presented and then may order that no hearing be held and declare that the action of the institution is satisfactory.

Open Hearings The hearing shall be open to the public, except when materials are considered that are not public records.Z. Conduct of Hearing (1) A tape recording or other verbatim record of the hearing shall be taken and maintained.(2) The testimony of witnesses, on oath or affirmation, and other evidence concerning any disputed facts shall be received by the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence, but shall accept all other evidence of a type commonly relied on by reasonably prudent persons in conduct of their serious affairs.(3) The hearing officer shall encourage stipulations of undisputed facts, and may seek to conciliate the dispute either before or after the hearing.(4) The hearing officer shall make findings of fact according to the preponderance of evidence.AA. Presentation of Evidence The complainant shall have the responsibility of producing satisfactory evidence of respondent's noncompliance with Section C. Both the complainant and the respondent shall have the right to appear and to participate in the hearing, to present relevant evidence to the hearing officer, to cross-examine witnesses and to submit rebuttal evidence.BB. Position SummariesAt the conclusion of the testimony, the hearing officer may permit each party to make a summation; if this privilege is extended to one side, it must be extended to the other side. The hearing officer may request the timely submission of written summations.CC. Findings and Recommendations(1) The hearing officer shall make explicit findings of fact respecting the alleged noncompliance of the respondent University. The findings shall be based on the hearing record.(2) If the hearing officer finds that noncompliance has occurred, the hearing officer shall formulate a curative recommendation for compliance.(3) In formulating the curative recommendation, the hearing officer shall consider the willingness and ability of the respondent to eliminate the noncompliance and any other factors relevant to the particular case.(4) The hearing officer shall submit findings of fact, conclusions and curative recommendation to the President, the complainant, the respondent University and the Director of Affirmative Action for the State of Oregon.DD. Order by Chancellor (1) The Chancellor may accept, modify or reject the findings of the hearing officer, and shall issue an order containing any findings of fact based on the hearing or on investigation by the Chancellor under Section U and the action necessary for compliance, if the institution or division is found in noncompliance. The order shall be issued no more than 15 days after completion of the hearing and copies shall be given promptly to the respondent, to the complainant, and to the compliance officer of the affected institution or division.(2) If the Chancellor believes sanctions should be imposed against any individual in addition to action necessary for compliance, the Chancellor shall notify the head of the institution or division, stating the reasons. Any proceedings thereafter taken against any individual pursuant to this paragraph shall be according to Administrative Rules of the Board or rules of the institution or division, as appropriate.(3) If requested, the hearing record shall be put into writing and shall be made available to the complainant and the respondent institution or division for copying, or copies thereof shall be made for them. The cost of reducing the record to writing, and of the making of copies thereof, shall be borne by the party so requesting.EE. Sanctions Against University(1) If, based on the Chancellor's own investigation of alleged noncompliance or as a result of the Chancellor's examination of the findings of fact of the hearing officer, the Chancellor concludes that any institution or division has violated Section A, that the institution or division has a record of noncompliance, that the magnitude and effect of the institution or division's noncompliance is sufficient to warrant monetary sanctions or that there is an unwillingness of the institution or division to comply with Section C, or any combination of these conclusions, the Chancellor may impose a monetary sanction against the institution or division.(2) A monetary sanction imposed under this rule shall not exceed the amount of legislatively appropriated funds received by the institution or division against which it is assessed. No monetary sanction in excess of $10,000 shall be assessed without approval of the Board.FF. Requirement of Prompt Attention to Complaints It is the desire and direction of the Board that, in carrying out the duties imposed on them by Section B to Section EE, the Chancellor, presidents, division heads, compliance officers, hearing officers and other personnel shall give high priority to the performance of such duties and shall proceed as expeditiously as possible to ascertain whether discrimination exists and to take curative measures.GG. Students Unable Because of Religious Beliefs to Attend Classes on Certain Days Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is unable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from attendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on that day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment missed because of the absence.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Title. This Policy shall be known as the Policy on University Policies.2. Purpose. The purpose of this Policy is to promote University-wide consistency, clarity andunderstanding of the formulation, approval and promulgation of University of Oregon Policies.3.

A policy establishes rights, requirements or responsibilities. Excluded from this definition are things such as, but not limited to, implementation guides, operating guidelines, internal procedures, and similar management controls and tools.3.2 Academic Policy. A Policy that addresses curriculum, academic standards, academic standards of admission, academic freedom, tenure and promotion, major changes to academic programs, grading standards, student life that relates to the educational process, or other matters of an academic nature as commonly understood in higher education, as specified in Section 1.3 of the University of Oregon Constitution.3.3 Responsible Office. An office designated by the Policy Advisory Council to be responsible for the development, review, maintenance and implementation of a Policy and for ongoing oversight of the Policy after its adoption.4. Process. The following Policy-making Process shall be used for the efficient development, adoption, revision, or repeal of all new or existing Policies.4.1 Any unit within the University such as a school, college, institution or department, may develop policies that relate solely to that unit so long as those policies do not conflict with applicable law and existing University Policies.4.2 The President shall convene and maintain a Policy Advisory Council (PAC) and shall appoint a Chair or Co-Chairs. The President of the University Senate (\u201cSenate President\u201d) shall serve as a member of the PAC and may delegate a member of the faculty to act in his or her place when necessary. The University President, in consultation with others, including the Senate President, shall appoint students, faculty and staff to the PAC at his or her discretion. The PAC will advise and assist the President in the prioritization and organization of University Policies that are to be developed, adopted, revised, or repealed pursuant to the Policy-Making Process.4.3 Any individual in the University community, any University unit, or the University Senate may submit a proposal for the development, revision or repeal of a Policy. Such a proposal shall be submitted to the University Secretary using a Policy Concept Form, to be developed and maintained by the University Secretary. On receiving a Policy Concept Form, the University Secretary shall post the Form on the Policy Library for public access and forward the Form to the Chair(s) of the PAC, who shall promptly forward it to PAC members.4.4 For each Policy to be revised or repealed, or for each Policy Concept Form proposing a new Policy, the Chair(s) of the PAC shall designate a Responsible Office and will charge the Responsible Office with facilitating the development and review of Policies. The Responsible Office shall establish deadlines in connection with the development of a new Policy or for the review of an existing Policy for revision or repeal. The Responsible Office shall identify key constituent groups and subject matter experts for consultation regarding specific Policies. The Senate President shall inform the PAC Chair(s) if he or she considers a policy to be an Academic Policy. Policies determined to be Academic Policies shall follow those provisions outlined in section 5.4.5 The Responsible Office, after consultation with groups identified pursuant to section 4.4, will draft proposed language for a new Policy, draft proposed language for the revision of an existing Policy, or recommend repeal of the Policy.4.6 The Office of General Counsel shall review proposed language to ensure compliance with the law and existing University Policies.4.7 The PAC shall ensure that each proposed revision, repeal or new Policy is made available for public comment. The PAC shall consider public comments and coordinate with the Responsible Office and General Counsel on any modifications resulting therefrom. For public comment on Academic Policies, see section 5.1.4.8 The President will take action on the Policy or forward the Policy to the Board for consideration pursuant to the Policy on Retention and Delegation of Authority.4.9 Notice concerning Policies that have been approved and published will be disseminated to vice presidents, deans, directors, the Senate President, the Senate Executive Coordinator, the presidents of the University\u2019s collective bargaining units, the President of the ASUO, and other relevant persons or offices.4.10 Following adoption of a Policy, the designated Responsible Office is responsible for assisting with the interpretation, administration, and oversight of the Policy and for developing standard operating procedures, guidelines, forms, user guides, and other materials to facilitate the implementation and enforcement of the Policy, as necessary.5.\u00a0 Academic Policies.5.1 For Academic Policies, the Senate President will initiate action within the Senate\u2019s procedures and in collaboration with appropriate others.

Maintenance. The Responsible Office shall perform a review of each Policy at least once every ten years to ensure compliance with current laws, regulations and practices. A policy review schedule will be maintained in the Policy Library.9. Emergency Policies.

Each action of this type shall have a duration of no more than six months unless a showing of necessity warrants a longer duration. If the President wishes to make the action permanent, the President shall follow the procedures in this Policy.10. Transition. This Policy on University Policies applies to University Policies developed, adopted, revised, or repealed after the effective date of this Policy. University Policies adopted prior to the effective date of this Policy shall, to the extent lawful, remain in effect until otherwise revised or repealed consistent with this Policy, independent Board action, or the processes specified in the Board\u2019s Policy on Retention and Delegation of Authority.11.

The power differential in the relationship may even make a student's consent to a sexual or romantic relationship suspect.(b) Moreover, the relationship may create an apparent or actual conflict of interest that can adversely affect other members of the University community. It places the faculty member or staff member in a position to favor the interest of the student in the sexual or romantic relationship at the expense of third parties. Even if consensual, the relationship may be disruptive of the collegiality and mutual trust that are essential for the effective functioning of an academic unit.(c) THEREFORE, it is a Conflict of Interest and abuse of power for: (1) faculty members and staff to engage in sexual or romantic relationships \u00a0(Relationships) with students enrolled in their classes or otherwise subject to their supervision or evaluation; (2) staff members to engage in sexual or romantic relationships with students subject to their supervision or authority; and (3) work supervisors to engage in sexual or romantic relationship with students subject to their supervision or evaluation. Conflicts of Interest can occur even when both parties have consented to the relationship. As defined and explained below, the University of Oregon prohibits Conflicts of Interest.(2) \u00a0Examples of Conflicts of Interest: Faculty\/Student Relationships.(a) Within the instructional context: No faculty member should initiate or acquiesce in a Relationship with a student who is enrolled in a course being taught by the faculty member or whose academic work (including work as a teaching assistant) is supervised or evaluated by the faculty member. Faculty members in Relationships that pre-date the course start date or the supervisory or evaluative relationship must make prompt Appropriate Arrangements,\u201d as defined below.(b) Outside the instructional context: A Relationship between a faculty member and a student outside the instructional context is a Conflict when the faculty member and student are in the same academic unit or in units that are academically allied and the faculty member has the power to make decisions that may reward or penalize the student with whom he or she is in a Relationship. \u00a0Faculty members in Relationships that pre-date the supervisory or evaluative relationship must make prompt Appropriate Arrangements, as defined below. Failure to make prompt Appropriate Arrangements may result in discipline.(3) Examples of Conflict of Interest: SEIU\/Student Relationships: A Relationship between an SEIU employee \u00a0and a student is a Conflict when the staff member has supervisory, evaluative or other power over the student. SEIU members in Relationships that pre-date the supervisory or evaluative relationship must make prompt Appropriate Arrangements, as defined below. Failure to make prompt appropriate arrangements (defined in (9)(a)) constitutes unwillingness to perform satisfactorily the responsibilities of the position and demonstrates unfitness for the position.(4) Complaint process: Complaints by students with standing to allege a violation of this policy shall be handled in accordance with procedures set forth in UO Policy 571.003(L). Complaints may be initiated by the student in the Relationship OR by third parties who are also in an evaluative relationship with the faculty or staff member and who allege they have been specifically adversely affected by the relationship. Complaints initiated by the students in the Relationship must be filed within 365 days of the end of the supervisory or evaluative relationship. \u00a0Any person may report an alleged violation of this policy to the Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity and when appropriate, it may also initiate an investigation.(5) Basis for findings: In assessing the evidence in a complaint or investigation:(a) The decision maker may only base his\/her finding of a violation of this policy upon no less than a preponderance of evidence that the Relationship occurred and there was a Conflict. If the Relationship pre-dated the Conflict, then the decision maker will also consider whether prompt appropriate arrangements were made;\u00a0(b) Consent to the Relationship does not obviate a conflict of interest as defined by this policy.(6) Abuse of Process: Complaints found to have been intentionally dishonest or made with willful disregard of the truth may subject the complainant to appropriate disciplinary proceedings and the full range of sanctions available therein.(7) Sanctions: Only the party with evaluative, supervisory or other power is subject to sanction for violating this policy. For unrepresented faculty, imposition of sanctions under UO Policy 580.021.0300-470(F), et seq., typically involves a hearing panel of peers. For represented faculty, discipline shall be imposed in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. For officers of administration, discipline will be imposed pursuant to applicable OA policies and procedures. Documentation (defined in (9)(c)) of arrangements believed to be appropriate will be taken into account in assessing whether a conflict of interest has occurred, whether it has been mitigated, to the extent possible, and in determining the severity of sanction, if any. The following list of sanctions that may be imposed is not intended to be exhaustive, and more than one sanction may be imposed for any single offense: written reprimand placed in the personnel file of the faculty or staff member; reassignment of duties (e.g., teaching, administrative, or service duties); reduction in salary; suspension without pay; dismissal.(a) Written reprimand may be imposed at the discretion of the appropriate Vice President.(b) Reassignment of duties, reduction in salary, suspension without pay, or dismissal may be recommended by the appropriate vice president, but may be imposed only after completion of appropriate proceedings:(A) For unrepresented faculty members, for cause proceedings are outlined in UO Policy 580.021.0300-470(F), et seq. For represented faculty, the collective bargaining agreement applies and for officers of administration, the OA policies and procedures apply.(B) For classified employees, sanctions will be imposed in accordance with applicable collective bargaining agreements.\u00a0(9) Definitions: As used in this policy:(a) \"Appropriate arrangement\" \u00a0is defined as prompt notification of the Provost or the Provost\u2019s designee and action, approved by the Provost or the Provost\u2019s designee, reasonably calculated to remove or substantially mitigate a conflict or a potential conflict of interest or abuse of power, taking into account the interests of the University, the parties to the relationship, and others actually or potentially affected. \u00a0For purposes of this section, prompt means within two weeks of the supervisory or evaluative Relationship beginning. Appropriate arrangements\u00a0 may include, but are not limited to: moving a student to another section of the same class; appointing a different faculty member to serve on a thesis, dissertation, or other evaluative committee; establishing alternative means of evaluation of academic or work performance; moving a student employee to another position of the same or comparable status and duties.(b) \"Conflict of interest\" is defined by the examples above and also means incompatibility of the interest of the University in securing detached, objective performance of instructional, supervisory, or other duties with the personal interest of the faculty or staff member involved in a sexual or romantic relationship with a student he or she supervises or evaluates.(c) \"Documentation\" includes but is not limited to a written, dated, and signed description of the actions taken filed with the Provost of the Provost\u2019s designee.(d) \"Faculty\" or \"faculty member\" means all those employees who hold academic appointments, including officers of administration and graduate teaching fellows, and anyone else who teaches classes at the University and\/or supervises the academic work of students.(e) \"Power\" means the real or objectively apparent authority or ability of an employee to confer or influence the academic, employment or other benefits of a student including, but not limited to: giving grades, evaluating performance, awarding financial benefits, or provision of University services or activities.(f) \"Standing\" means that a student has a supervisory or evaluative relationship with a faculty or staff member and is specifically injured by a conflict of interest as defined by this policy.(g) \"Staff\" or \"staff member\" means all University employees who do not hold academic rank.(h) \"Supervisor\" or \"employee with supervisory responsibility\" means all employees who exercise responsibility for provision of University services, assigning work, evaluating performance, or otherwise making decisions that affect the terms and conditions of a student's employment or academic experience at the University.(10) Nothing in this policy shall be construed as modifying an employee\u2019s reporting obligations under other UO policies including but not limited to, the student sexual and gender-based harassment and violence complaint and response policy.(11) Employees, students and campus community members who make good faith reports under this policy or who participate in an investigation initiated under this policy shall be protected from retaliation based on their report or participation.

In such instances, there should be a correlation between the contribution and the field in which naming is considered.\u00a0 Exceptions to the posthumous requirement may be granted by the Board of Trustees or the President, respectively, given the type of academic unit.\u00a0Procedural RequirementsSuggestions for naming an academic unit will be made through the Vice President for Advancement, in consultation with the Provost and Senior Vice President, to the President or the President\u2019s designee.\u00a0 The Vice President for Advancement may receive recommendations from and shall consult with appropriate others (e.g., appropriate vice presidents, deans, department heads, directors, etc.).Suggestions for naming in recognition of exceptional nonfinancial contributions to the University of Oregon or society at large shall include a description of the activities and circumstances that warrant consideration. While \"exceptional nonfinancial contribution\" could be operationalized in many different ways, for the purposes of this policy it is likely to describe remarkable activities, circumstances, and\/or experiences of individuals that directly served to advance or provide inspiration in advancing the values and mission of the University.The President or his\/her designee shall consult confidentially with the Faculty Advisory Council. The President may consult confidentially with any other advisory group that he\/she feels is appropriate.Pursuant to this policy, the President shall make a recommendation on naming an academic unit to the Board of Trustees for its approval when required.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 8: Academics, other\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Appointment Procedures(1) Each person to be appointed or reappointed as a member of the faculty shall be sent written notification of appointment and conditions and terms thereof for each period of employment. The notification shall be signed by the President or, for noninstitutional personnel, by the President or a designee. All appointments for a period in excess of one year must be authorized by the President.(2) The notice of appointment shall include, but not be limited to, the following:(a) Effective date of appointment;(b) Description of position offered (including references to any unusual duties);(c) Academic rank and title offered;(d) Duration of appointment;(e) Tenure status, including the nature of any restrictions on eligibility for tenure (e.g., limited term or temporary appointments or appointments funded by grant funds beyond institutional control);(f) Compensation;(g) Other conditions of employment.(3) The faculty member shall be provided written information concerning duties, responsibilities and institutional expectations. Such written information shall be provided with the initial notice of appointment and whenever significant changes occur. The written information shall include:(a) Specific expectations relating to the particular position;(b) General institutional expectations as to professional standards, obligations and responsibilities to be met by faculty members, including but not limited to the following:(A) Criteria to be used in evaluating the faculty member in connection with renewal of appointment, promotion, tenure (if faculty member does not have indefinite tenure) and post-tenure review (if the faculty member has indefinite tenure);(B) Procedures to be used in application of the evaluative criteria, including identification of officers responsible for accumulating the information and data necessary to the evaluation, making the evaluation, counseling with the faculty member concerning performance and areas of desirable improvement and such additional information as is necessary to outline clearly the procedures to be used;(C) Kinds of information that will be gathered by the institution as the basis for evaluating the faculty member;(D) A reference to institutional rules relating to faculty records;(E) The nature of the institutional staff career support program, with specific reference to institutional assistance available to assist the faculty member in improving teaching and other scholarly activities;(F) A reference to the agreement required by UO Policy 580.021.0100-135 Section C concerning the extent to which prior experience will be credited as a part of the probationary period of employment;(G) A reference to any exceptions agreed to as provided in Section UO Policy 580.021.0100-135, Section G.B. Affirmative Action Goals: Employment(1) The President shall establish affirmative action goals and procedures for the purpose of increasing the proportion and effective utilization of minorities and women employed in administrative, technical and faculty positions in programs and departments where minorities or women are underrepresented.(2) For purposes of this rule, \"minorities\" refers to Black African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian\/Pacific-Island Americans and American Indians\/Alaskan Natives.(3) The goals and procedures established under this rule shall be reviewed by the President for adequacy and effectiveness at the end of each biennium and modified accordingly. A report of this biennial review shall be submitted to the Board.C. Consultative ProceduresThe President shall establish written procedures through which faculty, department heads and deans shall have the opportunity for effective participation in deliberations leading to recommendations for appointment, reappointment, tenure or promotion of faculty. The procedures established shall also provide for consideration of information from other appropriate sources, including, but not limited to, student evaluations of faculty.D. Terms of Service of Faculty(1) Academic staff may be appointed on the academic-year basis, the fiscal-year basis or on such other basis as may be arranged in individual cases.(2) An academic year is normally the three-term period of service extending from September 16 of one calendar year through June 15 of the next calendar year, or for a comparable period of service within the fiscal year, whichever best serves the particular type of work involved, as may be required by the President. Nothing in this regulation shall be construed to prevent a staff member employed on an academic-year basis from being employed during the remainder of the fiscal year, in the summer sessions or in other service for the University, provided responsibilities for the regular academic year have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the department head and the dean or director of the division.E. Working HoursThe varied nature of the work of faculty members whose duties are administrative, instructional, research or extension makes it impractical to define the exact number of working hours. All such faculty members are required to give the institution their undivided efforts. Determination of time of service is the responsibility of the President. However, this provision shall not apply to Department employees who are subject to state or federal overtime compensation requirements.F. Outside Employment and Activities; Conflict of Interest(1) No full-time employee of the University shall engage in any outside employment that substantially interferes with duties. See also IMD 4.005 and 4.010, Board and Institution Policy on Outside Activities and Related Compensation.(2) University employees shall provide written reports to the President regarding potential conflicts of interest as defined under ORS 244.020(8). Complaints by any person regarding potential conflicts of interest may be referred for investigation to the President who shall investigate the complaint.G. Participation in Voluntary FTE Reduction ProgramDuring the period that any employee participates in a voluntary FTE reduction program authorized by the University, leave accruals and other benefits administered under this division will be calculated based upon the employee\u2019s FTE immediately prior to program participation and will not be reduced to reflect the reduction in FTE caused by the employee\u2019s participation in the program.H. Fellowship Leave(1) A fellowship leave is leave available to faculty who have received certain fellowships that support research, writing, advanced study or travel related to scholarly or professional activities, including, but not limited to, Fulbright, NEA, NEH, Guggenheim, or other comparable federal or private fellowships, payable only to the faculty member.(2) Any unclassified employee appointed at .5 FTE or more may be granted a fellowship leave upon approval of the President or designee. In addition, the President or designee may authorize continuation of institutional health care coverage and payment of employer contribution toward health care or other personnel expenses during a fellowship leave.(3) Each faculty member, in applying for a fellowship leave, shall sign an agreement to return to the institution for a period of at least one year's service on completion of the leave. If the faculty member fails to fulfill this obligation, the faculty member shall repay the full cost of benefits paid by the institution during the leave. This amount is due and payable three months following the date designated in the institution's fellowship leave agreement for the faculty member to return to the institution.I. Career Development LeaveCareer development leave is available to unclassified, faculty, and classified employees of the University as leave without pay, subject to the approval of the University.J. Vacations(1) Eligibility. Vacation means absence from work permitting rest and recreation for a specified period of time during which regular compensation continues. Unclassified employees gain vacation privileges only if employed at .50 FTE or more on a 12-month appointment.(2) Computation. Eligible unclassified employees accrue vacation on a monthly basis, beginning the first of the month following date of hire or on the first of the month if an employee is hired the first working day of the month. Vacation accrues on the last day of the month and is available for use the first day of the next month subject to the restrictions in Section J(3) of this policy. A 9-month employee appointed to a 12-month contract may receive credit for the previous 9-month contract, on a pro-rata basis. Eligible employees with a 12-month, 1.0 FTE contract accrue 15 hours of vacation per month; eligible employees on a .50 FTE or more contract accrue vacation in proportion to their FTE. An employee who terminates OUS employment before completing the 6-month wait period receives no vacation, and is not entitled to compensation for vacation accrued. On February 28, 1998, eligible employees shall be credited with vacation leave on a pro-rata basis at a rate of 14.67 hours per month as if monthly accrual had begun on their last vacation anniversary date or, for those employed fewer than 11 months, on their date of hire.(3) Wait Period and Maximum Balance. Vacation accrual is available to the unclassified employee for use six months after vacation accrual begins. Until September 1, 1999, there will be no maximum on the amount of vacation leave that an employee can accrue. However, effective September 1, 1999, no employee may accrue in excess of 260 hours, and any accrued vacation leave in excess of this cap will be forfeited.(4) Transfer.(a) Inter-institutional\/Unclassified to Unclassified. If an eligible unclassified employee transfers to another unclassified position within the Department and remains eligible for vacation accrual, the employee shall transfer all accrued vacation leave to the new position. However, if there is a break in service for more than 30 days, all accrued vacation pay will be paid off by the sending institution and the employee will be considered a new hire in the position. Moving from position to position within the same institution shall not be considered a transfer or a break in service for purposes of this rule.(b) For purposes of this Rule, OHSU shall be considered an institution within the Department whereby an OHSU unclassified employee who \"transfers to unclassified position within the Department and remains eligible for vacation accrual,\" may, subject to approval by the receiving department or institution, transfer all accrued vacation time from OHSU to an institution within the Department; upon such a transfer, the vacation benefits of a former OHSU employee shall be administered in accordance with Section J.(c) Classified to Unclassified Appointment. If a classified employee of the Department receives an unclassified appointment within the Department and is eligible for vacation leave, the employee may bring up to 80 hours of accrued vacation leave; the receiving department or institution may accept up to 250 hours maximum. The former classified employee shall receive cash compensation from the sending department or institution for any remaining accrued vacation leave. The former classified employee may use accrued vacation without serving a 6 month wait period.(5) The accrual of vacation leave is reduced on a pro-rata basis for the period of leave without pay, sabbatical leave, and educational leave. Vacation leave is accrued during other periods of paid leave.(6) Payment for Accrued Vacation Leave. Unclassified employees are not entitled to payment for unused vacation leave except upon termination of employment or upon transfer within the Department to another unclassified position not eligible for vacation benefits. Unclassified employees who transfer to a classified position within State of Oregon employment are subject to applicable OUS rules or collective bargaining agreements governing payment for accrued vacation. The maximum number of hours that can be paid upon termination or transfer is 180 hours.(7) Scheduling and Use of Vacation Leaves. Vacation leaves are scheduled with the approval of the employee's supervisor and should be planned cooperatively with the employee. Vacation leave should be scheduled in such a manner as to minimize disruption to the organization. Supervisors must be reasonable in allowing the use of vacation leave and may not unreasonably deny vacation requests where the result would be the forfeiture of accrued vacation. For purposes of calculation, one normal work day is the equivalent of eight hours of vacation leave for a full-time employee.(8) Record Keeping. The University is responsible for maintaining the individual records of vacation accrual and use.(9) Vacation Donation. The transfer of vacation time, for use by another employee, classified or unclassified, is not permitted.(10) Vacation Borrowing. Employees are not permitted to borrow against vacation that is not yet accrued. (Section 12, relating to interim provisions for employees moving from Management Service to Unclassified Service, was repealed December 1, 1999.)(11) Notwithstanding Section J(6) of this policy, from the period December 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015, unclassified employees of the Office of the Chancellor, upon termination or transfer as described in this rule, may receive cash payment for up to 260 hours of accrued vacation leave.K. Absence Due to IllnessReassignment of the work of a staff member incapacitated by illness over a period longer than one month must have the approval of the President or division head.L. Sick Leave Plan for Academic Personnel(1) Eligibility. All full-time academic staff will be credited with eight hours of sick leave for each full month of service, or two hours for each full week of service less than one month. Part-time academic staff employed .50 FTE appointment or more will be credited pro rata amount. Graduate assistants are not eligible to accrue or to use sick leave. An academic staff member whose appointment is less than .50 FTE is not eligible to accrue sick leave, but is eligible to use a prorate of sick leave accrued but unused while previously employed .50 FTE or more. In addition, sick leave is not earned or used during sabbatical leave, educational leave or leave without pay. Sick leave credit shall be earned during sick leave with pay and during other periods of paid leave. There is no limit on the amount of sick leave that may be accrued.(2) Earned Sick Leave Use. Academic staff who have earned sick leave credits must use the credits for any period of absence from service that is due to the employee's illness, injury, disability resulting from pregnancy, necessity for medical or dental care, exposure to contagious disease or attendance upon members of the employee's immediate family (employee's parents, spouse, children, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or another member of the immediate household) where employee's presence is required because of illness or death in the immediate family of the academic staff member or the academic staff member's spouse. As an alternative, the academic staff member can request to be on sick leave without pay. The institution may require a physician's certificate to support the sick leave claim for any absence in excess of 15 consecutive calendar days or for recurring sick leave use. The institution may require a physician's certificate before allowing return to work to certify that the return would not be detrimental to the academic staff member or to others.(3) Recordkeeping. At the time and in the manner prescribed by the President, each academic staff member covered by these provisions shall certify to the officer designated the amount of sick leave earned and the amount of sick leave with pay used. Sick leave records will be maintained in an appropriate file at the institution.(4) Sick Leave Without Pay. The President or designee may grant sick leave without pay for up to one year when the academic staff member has used all accrued sick leave with pay. The academic staff member must submit a written request for leave and shall be required to submit a physician's certificate. Extensions beyond one year may be granted on a year-by-year basis.(5) Unearned Sick Leave Advance. The purpose of this section is to provide salary continuance for up to 90 calendar days of absence due to illness through a combination of accrued and advance sick leave. Each full-time academic staff member is entitled to receive a sick-leave-with-pay advance as needed to provide the difference between sick leave earned as of the onset of the illness or injury and 520 hours; part-time staff are eligible to receive a sick-leave-with-pay advance proportional to FTE to provide the difference between sick leave earned as of the onset of the illness or injury and a prorate of 520 hours. As sick leave is earned, the amount shall replace any sick leave advanced until all advanced time is replaced with earned time. No more than a 520-hour sick leave advance is available during a seven-year period that begins with the first sick leave advance. More than one sick leave advance is possible as long as the total advance does not exceed 520 hours during a seven-year period. Sick leave that may have been advanced, but unused, cannot be considered for purposes of computing retirement benefits. Academic staff on fixed term appointment cannot receive an advance that extends beyond the end date of the fixed term appointment except upon written approval of the President or designee.(6) Transfer and Termination. An academic staff member is entitled to transfer in unused sick leave earned with any other agency of the State of Oregon including sick leave earned in the classified service provided the break in service upon transfer does not exceed two years. An academic staff member who leaves employment with the State of Oregon and then returns is entitled to reinstate the previous unused, accrued sick leave. An academic staff member who terminates employment is not entitled to compensation for unused sick leave except in the calculation of the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) retirement benefit as provided in ORS 237.153. As used in this subsection, and for these purposes only, the term \"any other agency of the State of Oregon\" shall include and apply to the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).(7) Summer Appointments. Regular nine-month academic staff employed half-time or more to teach summer session or to work on summer wage appointments are eligible to accrue and to use sick leave during the period of such appointment. Regular nine-month staff employed less than half-time during summer session are not eligible to accrue sick leave, but are eligible to use a prorate of sick leave earned but unused while previously eligible to accrue leave. Other summer session teaching staff hired only to teach summer session are not eligible to accrue or to use sick leave.(8) Workers' Compensation Integration. The purpose of this section is to insure that an academic staff member who receives a workers' compensation payment for lost time resulting from a compensable job-related illness or injury and salary paid for the same period of time does not exceed the academic staff member's regular salary for that period, and that paid leave is not charged for the payment received from workers' compensation:(a) Salary paid for a period of sick leave that is taken as the result of a job-related illness or injury compensable under workers' compensation shall be equal to the difference between the worker's compensation benefit for lost time and the academic staff member's regular salary for the period for which the benefit is being paid. An academic staff member who is receiving workers' compensation time loss benefits can choose to use a prorated amount of accrued sick leave or a prorated amount of other accrued paid leave or sick leave without pay. Should an academic staff member elect to use other accrued paid leave for this purpose, instead of sick leave, the salary paid for this period shall be the difference between the workers' compensation benefit paid for lost time and the academic staff member's regular salary for the period for which the benefit is being paid. In such instances prorated charges will be made against the accrued paid leave;(b) An academic staff member is not entitled to keep both salary, including paid leave, and workers' compensation benefits if the total exceeds the employee's regular salary. The University is responsible for coordinating the proration of salary, including sick leave or other paid leave, with workers' compensation lost time benefits. The University is entitled and is responsible to recover any salary overpayment that may have occurred. An academic staff member who receives a regular salary payment and a workers' compensation lost time benefit payment shall immediately notify the institutional payroll or other designated officer of such overpayment and shall return promptly to the University the amount of the salary overpayment. The University shall recover the amount of salary overpayment through payroll deduction or by cash payment according to existing University procedures.M. Transfer of Accumulated, Unused Sick Leave(1) University academic and administrative unclassified staff may transfer unused accumulated leave balances between the University and state agencies, subject to sick leave transfer provisions in (3) and (4), and applicable collective bargaining agreements.(2) For purposes of this policy, a \"state agency\" includes all state agencies in the executive, judicial, or legislative departments of the State of Oregon. Special government bodies, including community colleges, school districts, education service districts, are not considered state agencies for purposes of this rule. Local government public employers other than state agencies are likewise ineligible to transfer unused leave to or from the University.(3) Assumption of Funding Liability. Hiring agencies and departments assume funding liability for sick leave transferred under the provisions of this policy.(4) Sick Leave. The full amount of accumulated, unused sick leave available at the time an employee separates from service may be transferred to the University or state agency when the employee is hired. Unearned, advanced sick leave that results in a negative sick leave balance is neither transferred nor accepted by the University.(a) Accumulated, unused state agency sick leave earned during employment with a state agency, including leave earned in classified service, may be transferred to the hiring University if the break in service does not exceed two years, subject to approval of the hiring University.(b) Accumulated, unused sick leave earned during employment with the University shall be transferred to the hiring state agency if the break in service does not exceed two years, subject to the rules of the state agency.N. Use of Employees' Social Security Numbers(1) The University shall comply with the requirements of Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 when requesting disclosure of an employee's Social Security Number. Pursuant to the authority of the University to implement personnel systems and exercise payroll authority, the University may request that employees furnish valid Social Security Numbers for mandatory and voluntary uses, subject to the use and disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act.(2)(a) The University may require disclosure of an employee's Social Security Number for mandatory uses as provided for under Section 7(a)(2) of the Privacy Act, including:(A) Use and disclosure for certain program purposes, including disclosure to the Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, the Federal Parent Locator Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Medicare and Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, Workers Compensation, and, in appropriate cases, epidemiological research.(B) Administration and accounting purposes including the payment of state, federal and local payroll taxes; withholdings for FUTA and FICA; calculation and applicable reporting of pre-tax salary deductions for benefits including, but not limited to, IRC 117 and IRC 127 scholarship and educational assistance programs; IRC 457 deferred compensation and IRC 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans; IRC 401(a) retirement plans; IRC 132 pre-tax parking and transit plans, IRC 125 flexible spending account or cafeteria plans; or IRC 105 or 106 health reimbursement arrangements.(C) To the extent required by federal law, an employee's Social Security Number may be provided to a foreign, federal, state, or local law enforcement agency for investigation of a violation or potential violation of a law for which that entity has jurisdiction for investigation or prosecution.(b) The University may request voluntary disclosure and consent to use an employee's Social Security Number for the following purposes: internal verification and identification for personnel administration, employment-related background checks, payroll records, enrollments or elections for participation in campus programs and services provided by the public universities.(c) The University may request voluntary disclosure and consent to use the Social Security Number of an employee or the spouse, partner or dependent of the person requesting participation, as required by the administrator of each record-keeping system, benefit, program or service.(3) A request for disclosure of an employees' Social Security Number will notify the employee:(a) Whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary;(b) Under what statutory or other authority the social security number is requested;(c) What specific use or uses will be made of the number; and(d) What effect, if any, refusal to provide the number or to grant consent for a voluntary use as described above in (2)(b) and (c) will have on an individual.(4) An employee's Social Security Number may not be put to a voluntary use as described above in (2)(b) and (c) unless the employee has granted consent for that use. If, after having provided notice and received consent to use an employee's Social Security Number for specified purposes, the University wishes to use the Social Security Number for additional purposes not included in the original notice and consent, the requesting entity must provide the employee notice and receive the employee's consent to use the number for those additional purposes.(5) An employee's refusal to permit a voluntary use of his or her Social Security Number will not be used as a basis to deny the employee a right, benefit, or privilege provided by law.(6) The University will develop a model disclosure and consent form for use by the University. The University may use a disclosure and consent form that differs from the model form only if:(a) The differences are required to satisfy specific programmatic requirements or the entity's particular administrative needs, and(b) The form complies with all requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and this rule.O. Conditions of Employment on Gift, Grant and Contract Funds(1) The President shall determine whether unclassified personnel whose employment is financed primarily by gifts, grants or contracts shall be subject to University policies regarding vacations, sick leave, tenure, promotion, sabbatical leave and timely notice of nonrenewal or termination of employment.(2) University policies that do not apply to a particular employee, and any substitute provisions, shall be specifically identified in the notice of appointment.P. Grievance Procedures(1) The University shall adopt, in consultation with faculty advisory committees including female and minority faculty and representatives of certified bargaining units, if any, appropriate grievance procedures, in accordance with the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. The grievance procedures shall apply to all unclassified academic employees with faculty rank.(2) For purposes of this policy and Section Q:(a) \"Grievance\" means a complaint by an academic employee that the employee was wronged in connection with compensation, tenure, promotion or other conditions of employment or the employee's rights were denied as to reappointment;(b) \"Other conditions of employment\" shall include, but not necessarily be limited to: violations of academic freedom; discriminatory employment practices; nondiscriminatory employment practices; and laws, rules, policies, and procedures under which the University operates. However, challenges to disciplinary actions or procedures shall be raised under Section F;(c) \"Days\" mean calendar days unless expressly designated otherwise.(3) The University\u2019s grievance procedures shall:(a) Set out the details of a grievance procedure appropriate to the University;(b) Include both informal and formal steps. The formal steps shall include an appropriate administrator, a faculty committee (at the option of the grievant) and the President. The University may (at its option) provide a grievance officer. However, a grievance may be resolved at any step. In a formal grievance, all complaints, responses and decisions must be in writing;(c) Establish time limits within which a grievance must be filed and for each step that will permit timely resolution of issues. Informal grievances shall receive a response within 15 days. In no instance shall the length of time between the presentation of the written grievance and the final University decision be more than 180 days, unless agreed to by the grievant. In the event a decision is not made at any level within the designated time limit, the grievant may submit the grievance to the next step;(d) Provide for a hearing, at the option of the grievant, by a faculty committee selected by the faculty at the University.(e) Provide for the appointment by the president of an administrative officer, or officers, (grievance officer) to receive and act upon the recommendations of the faculty committee. The University may, alternatively, opt to have the President receive and act upon the recommendations of the faculty committee.(4) The University may elect not to proceed with a grievance if the grievant also seeks resolution in another forum.(5) The University shall adopt rules of procedure for the faculty committee that allow for:(a) A meaningful opportunity for the grievant to be heard;(b) An opportunity for each party to present evidence, argument and rebuttal;(c) The right to representation for each party at that party's expense;(d) A hearing open to the public at the option of the grievant to the extent allowed by law;(e) Written conclusions, based only upon evidence presented at the hearing; and(f) Access by each party to a complete record of the hearing.(6) The faculty committee shall make recommendations regarding the disposition of the grievance to the grievance officer or President (depending on the University\u2019s election).(7) Unless the grievance is resolved at a lower level, the President or grievance officer (depending on the University\u2019s election), shall review the recommendations of the faculty committee, if any, and the President or grievance officer shall issue a decision.(8) If the President or grievance officer (depending on the University\u2019s election) rejects or modifies the recommendations of the faculty hearing committee, the reasons shall be stated in writing, and a copy provided to the grievant and to the hearing committee.(9) Where the University has opted to use a grievance officer, the grievant may appeal the decision of the grievance officer to the President pursuant to Section Q.(10) Under either option as set forth above, and except as set forth herein, the decision of the President shall be final, and shall be an exhaustion of grievant's administrative remedies with the University and the Board of Trustees (Board). If the grievance involves the President or where the President is the immediate supervisor of the grievant, then the appeal, set forth in Section 9, shall be to the Board (all other provisions of this rule shall otherwise apply).(11) Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to limit the right of the Board to make such inquiry and review into personnel actions as it may from time to time deem, in its sole discretion, appropriate.(12) Where collective bargaining agreements or policies exist at the University in which grievance procedures are specified and such procedures exceed the standards in this policy, such agreements or policies shall control, to the extent not inconsistent with the policy.(13) After consultation with the appropriate faculty committees and approval of the President, the University shall adopt its policies by October 1, 2001.(14) The University shall report annually to the Board beginning July 2002, on the number, basis and outcome of all formal grievances filed under the policies herein required.Q. Appeal of Grievance Decisions(1) Where the University has opted to utilize the process of decision by a grievance officer as set forth in Section P(3)(e), a grievant may request review by the President of a decision described in Section P(7). The President shall review the record of the grievance. The President shall decide, based on his\/her own review, whether to support the grievance officer's decision. The President\u2019s decision must be reached within 90 days of the date on which the request is received in the President's Office.(2) A request for review by the President shall be in writing and must be received in the President's Office within 15 days of the grievant's receipt of the grievance officer's decision. The request shall briefly state the basis for the request for review and the specific facts that would support action by the President consistent with Section Q(4) of this policy. The request shall include a copy of the grievance officer's decision.(3) Review by the President shall consist of an examination of the record of the grievance. The President may elect to receive additional written or oral presentations from the grievant and the grievance officer.(4) The President shall not reverse a decision of a grievance officer unless:(a) Procedural error was committed by the University during the grievance procedure and the error resulted in prejudice to the grievant;(b) The decision of the grievance officer is not supported by substantial evidence; or(c) The decision is in conflict with applicable policies or law.(d) The President\u2019s decision shall be in writing and shall be sent to the grievant and the grievance officer.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

This policy allows for release of such information while maintaining the commitment of confidentiality to external referees and others preparing reports and recommendations.After the dean has formulated a recommendation, but before the dossier is forwarded to the Office of Academic Affairs, the dean or associate dean, if so designated, will meet with the candidate. At this meeting:1. Faculty shall be given an oral summary of the contents of his or her file and the recommendations made to date, including that of the dean. The oral summary should include relevant information presented in the departmental report, the general content of the outside letters, and the recommendation by the Dean's Advisory, or Personnel, Committee.2. If the faculty member has not waived his or her right of access, he or she may examine all the contents of the dossier that are open as defined by the formal statement of waiver.3. If the faculty member has waived his or her right of access, and if requested by the faculty member, the dean shall provide a written version of the oral summary. This document, typically no more than 1-2 pages in length, should accurately reflect the oral summary, and should not be an item-by-item summary of any report, evaluation or letter contained in the dossier.4. If the candidate believes that his or her record has been misinterpreted, misunderstood, or is incomplete, he or she may submit to the Office of Academic Affairs a written statement of rebuttal. This document will be added to the dossier for review at all subsequent levels.5. Redaction or substantive summary of material is not undertaken at the school\/college level, or provided to faculty during or immediately after his or her meeting with the dean.Faculty who have waived their right of access may request redacted versions of reports by elected faculty personnel committees and\/or substantive summaries of any closed part of the file, but only following a negative decision by the Provost. A proper summary (abstract) is interpreted to mean document-by-document, not a general summary, with the condition that editing and abstracting will maintain the confidentiality of sources who submitted their evaluations with assurance of confidentiality in accordance with the candidate's waiver statement. Substantive summaries shall be prepared by the Office of Academic Affairs and reviewed by a member of the Faculty Personnel Committee.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a009\/08\/1999Issued by:\u00a0PresidentDate:\u00a009\/08\/1999Revision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.145 to 02.01.16Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

This attitude constitutes application of the same principle that has prevailed in the scheduling of campus speakers.Coordination of and arrangements for employment interviews are the responsibility of the Career Center. Arrangements for interviews take into consideration:(a) The number of students who are likely to be interested in talking with the prospective employer;(b) Any exhibitions which the prospective employer desires to display;(c) Whether or not the prospective employer desires to have a group meeting of interested students which is to be followed by individual interviews, or whether individual interviews are to be arranged; and(d) Approved University procedures for use of its facilities.Recruiting representatives of prospective employers, whether public or private are treated equally.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a006\/07\/1985Issued by:\u00a0Associate Provost for Student AffairsDate:\u00a006\/07\/1985Revision History:\u00a005\/01\/1977 Promulgated as AM 16.08006\/07\/1985 Reviewed and recommended by President's Staff06\/07\/1985 Reissued by Associate Provost for Student Affairs02\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 1.000 to 01.00.0902\/08\/2011 Reviewed.\u00a0 No changes necessary.Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Pursuant to this IMD, attorneys authorized to provide legal services to the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office, or OUS institutions are reviewing or drafting the following agreements in order to evaluate legal risk and to confirm compliance with applicable federal or state laws, including constitutional provisions, statutes, administrative rules, or regulations.(a) Any agreement for the purchase or sale of real property or the purchase or sale of improvements to real property;(b) Employment agreements or notices of appointments with the Chancellor, Vice Chancellors, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Provosts, Vice Provosts, Athletic Directors, Head Coaches, or any other employee with an annual salary in excess of $300,000;(c) Employment agreements with other than tenured faculty for a term of three years or longer;(d) Any agreement with a value in excess of $250,000:(i) which includes the development of software or acquisition of software not \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d; or(ii) which includes a foreign entity, public or private, or an Indian tribe as a party; or(iii) under which the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office, or OUS institution provides services; or(iv) under which the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office , or OUS institution provides tangible or intangible property or the right to use tangible or intangible property.(e) Any agreement under which the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution takes equity in a company in which the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office, or institution provides services, tangible or intangible property, or the right to use tangible or intangible property;(f) Any settlement agreement or release of claims;(g) Any faculty or student exchange agreement under which an institution will pay or receive money or property;(h) Any docket materials from an OUS institutionon a matter submitted to the Office of the State Board for Board action. The OUS general counsel will review docket materials for the Chancellor\u2019s Office and the docket in its entirety for the Board Secretary and Chancellor;(i) Any non-utility easement; and(j) Any solicitation documents for a competitive procurement that will result in a contract or agreement subject to this IMD.(2) The legal review required by this IMD may be accomplished,for applicable transactions,by form or template agreements drafted by an attorney authorized to provide legal services to the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution, as applicable, and made available to the relevant department or personnel in the Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution.(3) The Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution may develop an internal process in order to exempt categories or sub-categories included in this IMD from legal review or to add categories or sub-categories to the list for legal review for the Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution, as appropriate. The process should identify how legal risk, notwithstanding an exemption, will be reasonably managed. The Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution may not exempt a category or sub-category from this list until the process document is on file with the OUS Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration or designee. Once a process document is in place and filed with the OUS Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration or designee, the Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution will file any and all exemptions or additions to the list, applicable to the Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution, with the OUS Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration or designee.(4) The Chancellor\u2019s Office and OUS institutions are encouraged, pursuant to the internal process developed to exempt or add categories or sub-categories to this list at section (A)(3) of the IMD, to consider and implement appropriate \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions to the list, cognizant of expertise and personnel at the Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution, as applicable.(5) Each in-house attorney authorized to provide legal advice and services to the Board, the Chancellor\u2019s Office, or OUS institution, as applicable, will maintain a log of each agreement or document reviewed or drafted pursuant to this IMD.(6) The applicable in-house legal services office, whether for the Chancellor\u2019s Office or OUS institution is responsible for compiling a log of each agreement or document reviewed or drafted by outside counsel pursuant to this IMD.(7) Any agreement or document subject to legal review under this IMD must include evidence of such review, such as the attorney\u2019s signature or communication from the attorney attached to the agreement or document. For instances in which the Board, Chancellor\u2019s Office, or OUS institution is using a form or template agreement as contemplated by Section (A)(2) of this IMD, notation or reference to the form or template drafted by the attorney is sufficient for this section.(8) Nothing in this IMD removes or alters other requirements for the proper execution of an agreement or document, such as signature by an authorized contracting authority or compliance with procurement rules, policies or procedures, or other Board policies and requirements.(9) Not withstanding the list of agreements and documents included in this IMD, employees are encouraged to approach agreements and documents from a risk-conscious perspective and seek out legal review and advice proactively. Nothing in this IMD prevents or should discourage legal review of agreements or documents not included in Section (A)(1)(a)-(j).(B) ReviewThis IMD will be reviewed by OUS attorneys, contracting officers, and other relevant stakeholders annually for amendment or revision, with specific care to consider how risk is managed by the inclusion, or exclusion, of particular categories or sub- categories.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Related Resources:\u00a0Name of authority: Senate Bill 242 (2011), including ORS Chapter 351 and its amendmentsOregon Administrative Rule 580 Oregon State Board of Higher Education policy.URL of authority: www.ous.edu\/state_boardPolicy on Legal Services\u00a0 http:\/\/www.ous.edu\/state_board\/poliproOriginal Source:\u00a0Internal Management Directive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

This particular policy explains in detail the reporting obligations of University employees when they learn of sexual and gender-based harassment and violence involving students, including student employees as part of that comprehensive structure.\u00a0Other policies govern the processing of such reports, the obligations of some employees pursuant to the Clery Act to gather information about crimes on University controlled properties, and the University\u2019s procedures for handling disclosures of sexual harassment by non-student employees.\u00a0 Those policies can be found here:For information about how the University\u2019s Title IX Coordinator and Student Conduct Office process reports received under this policy that are made by students against students, see the Student Conduct Code, the Student Conduct Sexual Misconduct Standard Operating Procedures, and the Student Discrimination Process.For information about how the University\u2019s Title IX Coordinator and the Office of Affirmative Action process reports received under this policy that are made by students against employees, see UO Policy 580-015.For information about the obligations of employees who are \u201cCampus Security Authorities\u201d under the Clery Act, see \u201cClery Act\u201d under Related Resources below.For information about the reporting and processing of complaints about sexual harassment in the workplace involving a non-student employee, see the University\u2019s discrimination complaint and response policy. (The reporting obligations for student employees are covered in Section X of this policy and require designated reporters and employees who supervise a reporting student and\/or who supervise the alleged harasser to pass information on to the Title IX Coordinator.).In general, any questions about the intersection or applicability of any of these other policies and procedures can be directed to the University\u2019s Title IX Coordinator (contact information in related resources below). However, one of the most frequently asked questions regarding reporting obligations relates to what happens after information is shared by a designated reporter. To address that concern, this introduction briefly shares a few important points about the University\u2019s response once an employee reports to the University\u2019s Title IX Coordinator (the University\u2019s response is explained more completely in the policies referenced above in points 1 and 2).\u00a0\u00a0Once a report is made, the University\u2019s response begins by providing the student who has experienced sexual or gender-based harassment immediate access to measures designed to allow the student to continue with his or her education.\u00a0 All students who have experienced prohibited discrimination will be provided with remedial and supportive measures, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate in a formal University process. These measures include but are not limited to confidential crisis outreach at any time of day or night, counseling services, academic accommodations, residential modifications, mutual no contact orders and other measures necessary to ensure that the student is able to fully and fairly access the student\u2019s education. If a formal University process is later initiated, protective measures, which are actions that directly impact the alleged perpetrator, will also be provided as appropriate, such as prohibiting or restricting the alleged perpetrator\u2019s presence at certain places on campus.In all cases, the University\u2019s response is designed to consider the victim\u2019s preferences regarding the University\u2019s response, and to provide deference to a victim\u2019s wishes wherever possible. Once the University\u2019s processes are initiated after a report under this policy, students who have experienced sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and sexual violence, have the right to request confidentiality and\/or that the University not take action in response to the underlying report. The University will evaluate a student\u2019s request as described in its sexual misconduct standard operating procedures, referenced above and available here.\u00a0 The University may also intervene less formally where an alternative resolution can be equally effective in stopping the harassment, preventing its recurrence and remedying any effects. Regardless of the type of response, the reporting student will be consulted and kept informed as to any actions taken by the University.Finally, the University\u2019s response will protect from retaliation students and employees who make good faith reports under this policy or who participate in a University process initiated in response to a report of prohibited discrimination.Policy StatementThe University is committed to maintaining an environment free of harassment and discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, gender, perceived gender, or gender identity that would violate Title IX (hereafter \u201cprohibited conduct\u201d). The University is committed to ensuring equal access to programs, course offerings, facilities, admission and employment for all of its students by providing educational and employment environments free from harassment and discrimination.In order to create these environments and comply with Title IX, a well-designed \u201cresponsible employee\u201d policy is an integral part of an effective response to prohibited conduct. An effective response also requires the clear identification of the roles of administrators, faculty, staff, and student staff, so that students can make a clear and informed decision about whom to contact for support, institutional response, and\/or resources.This policy will ensure clarity and transparency as well as compliance with Title IX by precisely identifying \u201cdesignated reporters,\u201d thereby allowing students to make informed decisions about whether to disclose information to employees who are required to report any and all disclosures to the Title IX office. Identifying \u201cconfidential employees\u201d with precision allows students to know who is able to keep disclosures confidential. Designating all other employees as \u201cstudent-directed employees,\u201d with specific response obligations, including the provision of support and resources, maximizes students\u2019 access to supportive University personnel and affords students another avenue by which they can initiate a report to the Title IX coordinator if they so choose.Under this policy every University employee falls into one of three categories: designated reporter, student-directed employee, or confidential employee. These terms will be defined in more detail below, but in summary they are:Designated Reporters: This policy designates as \u201cresponsible employees\u201d for Title IX purposes those employees who have the authority to address prohibited conduct and whom students would reasonably expect to have the authority to remedy prohibited conduct in light of this policy. The University of Oregon refers to responsible employees as \u201cDesignated Reporters\u201d because they are always obligated to report student disclosures to the Title IX office if they have \u201creportable evidence\u201d of prohibited conduct.Student-Directed Employees: This policy places other employees in the category of \u201cStudent-Directed Employees\u201d and requires that Student-Directed Employees offer students information, resources, support, and the ability to report if that is the student\u2019s choice. While Student-Directed Employees are required to provide resources and to support a student\u2019s choice, Student-Directed Employees do not have the ability to address the discrimination or to implement corrective measures in response to a disclosure.Confidential Employees: This policy designates as \u201cConfidential Employees\u201d those employees who have a professional commitment and\/or legal privilege that may enable them to oppose successfully an application for a court order seeking disclosure of communications. Confidential employees have the same obligations as Student-Directed Employees in terms of offering students information, resources, support, and the ability to report, but their professional obligations and\/or commitment to confidentiality provides an additional layer of confidentiality for students who desire it.This policy is intended to encourage reporting by students who have experienced prohibited conduct because it clearly identifies responsible employees for reporting purposes, respects the wishes of students when they talk to other employees, and makes all employees at the institution part of the solution to prohibited conduct.Discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, regardless of the relative power of the harasser, is disruptive of workplace and campus life and denies students equal educational opportunity. Prohibited Discrimination and retaliation impede the realization of the University\u2019s educational mission and shall not be tolerated at the University of Oregon.DefinitionsProhibited Discrimination is defined as any act that either in form or operation, and whether intended or unintended, unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, or the use of leave protected by state or federal law. \"Unintentional discrimination\" is a concept applicable only to situations where a policy, requirement, or regularized practice, although neutral on its face, can be shown to have disparately impacted members of a protected class.Discriminatory Harassment is defined as any conduct that either in form or operation unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, or the use of leave protected by state or federal law and that is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work or participation in any University program or activity, including academic activities because it creates an intimidating, hostile, or degrading working or University environment for the individual who is the subject of such conduct, and where the conduct would have such an effect on a reasonable person who is similarly situated.Sexual Harassment is a type of sex discrimination which is defined as any sexual advance, any request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:Submission to such advances, requests, or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, academic experience or participation in any University program or activity;Submission to or rejection of such advances, requests, or conduct by an individual is used as a basis or condition for employment, participation in any University program or activity or academic experience; orSuch conduct is unwelcome and sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work, participation in any University program or activity and\/or academic experience because it creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working, University or academic environment for the individual who is the subject of such conduct, and where the conduct would have such an effect on a reasonable person who is similarly situated.Sexual harassment includes sex and gender-based stalking, sexual misconduct, as defined in the Student Conduct Code, sex and gender-based harassment and bullying, dating violence, and domestic violence. Sexual harassment may be committed by any person upon any other person, regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation, and\/or gender identity of those involved.\u00a0 In addition to sexual misconduct, as defined in the Student Conduct Code, sexual harassment is defined as follows:Sex and gender based stalking occurs when, based on a person\u2019s sex or gender: (1) a person knowingly alarms or coerces another person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household by engaging in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person; (2) it is objectively reasonable for a person in the complainant\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and (3) the repeated and unwanted contact causes the complainant reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the complainant or a member of the complainant\u2019s immediate family or household.Sex and gender-based harassment and bullying means any act that: (1) Substantially interferes with work or academic performance; (2) Has the effect of: a. Physically harming a student or employee or damaging their property; b. Knowingly placing a person in reasonable fear of physical harm to the person or damages the person\u2019s property; or c. Creating a hostile environment, including interfering with the psychological well-being of a person; and (3) May be based on, but not be limited to, the sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity of the person. Gender-based harassment and bullying includes cyberbullying, which means the use of any electronic communication device to perform gender-based harassment or bullying.Dating Violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the complainant\u2019s statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of the interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purpose of this definition: (1) Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, causing or attempting to cause sexual or physical abuse, placing another in fear of imminent sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse; and (2) Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of Domestic Violence.Domestic Violence means violence between family or household members. Family or household members means: Spouses or former spouses; adults related by blood, marriage or adoption; persons cohabitating or who have cohabitated; persons in a past or present sexually intimate relationship; unmarried parents of a child. Abuse means: The occurrence of one or more of the following acts within a domestic or dating relationship: a. Attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury. b. Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury. c. Causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.Designated Reporter: The following individuals are a Designated Reporter, known under federal law as a \u201cresponsible employee,\u201d for any disclosures made by a student victim directly to the employee about sexual harassment, sex and gender-based stalking, sex and gender-based harassment and bullying, dating violence, and\/or domestic violence. A person on this list is not a Designated Reporter if that individual is also a Confidential Employee.All members of the Board of Trustees (including student, faculty, and staff members)PresidentSenior Vice President and ProvostVice PresidentsAssociate Vice PresidentsSenior Vice ProvostVice ProvostsAthletic Director (Director of Intercollegiate Athletics)Senior Associate and Deputy Athletic DirectorsAssociate Athletic DirectorsAssistant Athletic DirectorsAll Coaches of NCAA Intercollegiate Sports (except that a coach below the level of head coach is a Student-directed Employee instead of a Designed Reporter when a student-athlete on that coach\u2019s team discloses having experienced prohibited discrimination to that coach)Director of Student ConductStudent Conduct Code OfficersTitle IX CoordinatorDeputy Title IX CoordinatorsTitle IX Appeals OfficerDirector of Affirmative Action and Investigators (EEO Specialists)Director of Campus OperationsDirector of HousingDirector of Residential Life & Educational InitiativesSenior Associate Director of HousingSenior Director of Employee and Labor RelationsDeansAssociate Deans responsible for more than one academic unit, such as the following: Senior Associate Dean for Faculty and Operations; Associate Dean for Humanities; Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education; Associate Dean for Sciences; Associate Dean for Social SciencesAssistant Dean, Administration and Operations (CAS)Dean of StudentsDepartment HeadsChief Human Resource OfficerDirector of Fraternity and Sorority LifeDirector of Study AbroadAssociate Provost, Portland CampusGeneral Counsel and all attorneys in that officeResident Assistants and Orientation LeadersUniversity of Oregon Police OfficersConfidential Employee: The following employees are Confidential Employees, meaning that in addition to the fact that they will not report to the Title IX office without the student\u2019s permission, they have a professional commitment and\/or legal privilege that may enable them to oppose successfully an application for a court order seeking disclosure of communications. Confidential Employees will not share information disclosed to them with others unless requested to do so by the student, required by applicable law and professional codes of ethics or responsibilities, or because the information falls under Section III.C.11 of this policy (imminent risk of serious harm). Confidential Employees may still have reporting obligations under the Clery Act. For information about the Clery Act and who is a Campus Security Authority with reporting obligations, who is a confidential employee for Clery Act purposes, and what the reporting obligations are for a Campus Security Authority (Clery reports generally do not contain personally identifying information), see Related Resources, \u201cClery Act,\u201d below. For the purposes of this policy, Confidential Employees are the following:Health care professionals working at the UO, including at the Health Center;Counseling professionals working at the University Counseling and Testing Center;Mental health professionals working at the UO, including those working in the Psychology Clinic, Couples and Family Therapy (CFT) Clinic, Child and Family Clinic (CFC), and Early Childhood CARES (including graduate students who are participating in the diagnoses and treatment of a person under the direction of a licensed mental health professional);Professionals working in Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services;The University\u2019s Ombudsperson and program staff (Note: The Ombudsperson does not have a legal privilege of confidentiality, but under its professional code of ethics the Ombudsperson must take steps to avoid, whenever possible, disclosure of confidential records and information);Attorneys working with Student Survivor Legal Services in the Domestic Violence Clinic; and,Attorneys working in Office for Student Advocacy and ASUO Student Legal Services.Note regarding limits to legal privilege: There are other employees on campus who are members of a profession that have a legal privilege of confidentiality when the employee is acting in that professional role. In many instances, employees will not be acting in that professional role. Employees should inform students regarding these legal privileges and their limits at the start of any conversations about matters covered under this policy.Important Note regarding the University\u2019s Ombudsperson: While disclosure to the ombudsperson does not constitute a report or notice to the University, the privacy protections provided to the ombudsperson are based in policy and not law. Therefore, while the University considers conversations with the ombudsperson to be private, some records may be disclosed pursuant to a search warrant or subpoena and may not be legally confidential. In addition, the ombudsperson will periodically report non-personally identifiable information about sexual and gender-based and harassment and violence it has received to the Title IX Coordinator to keep the Title IX Coordinator informed of the general extent and nature of reported misconduct on and off campus. This will help the Title IX Coordinator track patterns, evaluate the scope of the problem, and formulate appropriate campus-wide responses.Student-Directed Employee.\u00a0 A \u201cstudent-directed employee\u201d is any employee who is not a Designated Reporter or a Confidential Employee. This includes most faculty, staff, administrators and student-staff.Reportable Evidence: Except for the four exceptions outlined below, Designated Reporters are required to share any information about suspected sexual or gender-based harassment or violence, whether based on a direct disclosure by a student, observed conduct, information provided by a third party or other source of information. This information is \u201cReportable Evidence.\u201d\u00a0 The requirement to report is not based on a determination of credibility of the report, nor should the Designated Reporter take action to investigate the veracity of the reported information.Designated Reporters are NOT required to share information obtained under the following circumstances and this information is not Reportable Evidence:\u00a0\u00a0During public awareness events (for example, \u201cTake Back the Night,\u201d \u201cSWAT\u201d presentations, and \u201csurvivor speakouts\u201d);As part of an Institutional Review Board-approved human subjects research protocol focused on Prohibited Discrimination;From a class the student is taking (Note: If a faculty member who is a Designated Reporter believes that a class assignment or discussion may elicit a disclosure that would trigger obligations under this policy, that faculty member should make clear to students that an account provided in response to a class assignment or discussion, without more information, will not result in the University taking any action in response to the disclosure. This means that the University will not investigate the incident, offer interim measures or otherwise take step to remediate the behavior.); and,Information obtained during a conversation that is otherwise privileged or confidential under state or federal law. Examples of this exclusion include, but are not limited to: attorneys, who are not required to disclose information covered by the attorney-client privilege; union stewards and union representatives, who are not required to disclose information obtained during a conversation with a member regarding workplace issues (including grievances); and licensed mental health professionals (counselors, psychologists, etc.), who are not required to disclose information covered by an applicable privilege.Student: For purposes of this policy, the term Student has the meaning set forth in the Student Conduct Code.Employee: A person in an employment relationship with the University.Campus Community Member: Campus Community Member means a person participating in a University-sponsored program or activity, attending or wanting to attend an event on University-owned or leased property, an independent contractor or vendor, a volunteer, a person applying for admission, a person applying for employment, or a campus visitor or a person living on University-owned property. The term Campus Community Member excludes Employees and Students.Supervisor: For purposes of this policy, a Supervisor is a person who has the power to take tangible employment actions against an employee, i.e., to effect a significant change of employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits. It is important to note that just because person\u2019s title contains the word supervisor, that person is not necessarily a supervisor for purposes of this policy. Only those people with the duties previously mentioned are Supervisors for purposes of this policy.Resident Assistant. Resident Assistants (RAs) are live-in student leaders in the residence halls, employed by University Housing.Orientation Leaders. Orientation Leaders are part of the Student Orientation Staff (SOS). They are current undergraduate students who represent the University of Oregon and guide new students through a smooth transition to life on campus.\u00a0Obligations of EmployeesObligations of All EmployeesAs a caring community, and to promote a compassionate campus community, we expect employees of the University of Oregon to do the following when responding to disclosures:Respond with respect and with kindness.Listen to what the student wants to tell you before handing out referrals and information.Be sensitive to the needs of the survivor, without being judgmental, paternalistic, discriminatory, or retaliatory.At the outset of the conversation, if a student appears under 18, ask the student if the student is 18 years of age or older. If the student is under 18, explain that all employees, except for Confidential Employees operating in that professional role, have to report all disclosures of \u201cabuse\u201d as defined by state law (see ORS \u00a7 419B.005), including physical or sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or a current threat of physical or sexual abuse of a minor, to the Department of Human Services or a law enforcement agency.Note for Students Who Are Minors: If a faculty or staff member receives information from a student under 18 of \u201cabuse\u201d as defined by state law (see ORS \u00a7 419B.005), including physical or sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or a current threat of physical or sexual abuse, the faculty or staff member shall follow state law (See Related Resources below, \u201cChild Abuse,\u201d for information about state law on mandatory reporting). In addition, if a student who is a minor discloses prohibited conduct under this policy, the employee shall follow this policy. We encourage employees to make extra efforts to connect students who are minors with Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services so that the minor is connected with age-appropriate services. Additional effort can include strongly encouraging the student to permit such a referral and staying connected to the student until the student is in fact connected with Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services. For guidance on responses to minors who are not students but visitors on campus, see the University\u2019s guidance entitled \u201cMinor on Campus\u201d under Other Resources below.Obligations of Designated ReportersAll Designated Reporters shall affix a sticker to their door, provided by the Title IX office, that identifies them as a Designated Reporter.Designated Reporters who receive Reportable Evidence of Prohibited Discrimination, such as Sexual Harassment of a Student (including sex and gender-based stalking, sexual misconduct as defined in the Student Conduct Code, sexual and gender-based harassment and bullying, dating violence and\/or domestic violence), must report any information received to the Title IX Coordinator.Students should be aware that the Title IX Coordinator is tasked with ensuring compliance with this policy and state and federal law, and ensuring the equity and fairness of all Title IX response processes for all students. Therefore, while the Title IX Coordinator will work with students to ensure that they understand their complaint options, are protected from retaliation and are provided with interim measures as appropriate, the Title IX coordinator is not an advocate for individual students participating in the process.Obligations of Student-Directed EmployeesGeneral: Faculty and staff who are not a Designated Reporter or a Confidential Employee (as defined under II.E) also have responsibilities when students disclose Reportable Evidence of Prohibited Discrimination, such as Sexual Harassment, (including sex and gender-based stalking, sexual misconduct as defined in the Student Conduct Code, sex and gender-based harassment and bullying, dating violence, and\/or domestic violence). Although Student-Directed Employees have obligations when a disclosure is made, they do not have the authority to address the discrimination or to implement corrective measures to stop the behavior.Informed Consent re Imminent Risk of Serious Harm. At the outset of the conversation, explain to the student that if you believe that any person is at imminent risk of serious harm, you may have to report the incident to ensure the safety of the persons involved.No Report, No University Response. When appropriate in the conversation, inform the student that unless there is a report made to a Designated Reporter or the Title IX office, the University probably cannot take action to stop the discrimination or harassment, remedy its effects, or prevent future instances of discrimination and harassment, because it will likely not know about the underlying behavior.\u00a0 With a report, the University will be obligated to take action on the report.Resources. Provide the student with an approved brochure or card, or other resources provided by the Dean of Students and the UO Title IX Coordinator AND\/OR refer the student to the safe.uoregon.edu Web site.Ask About Reporting. Explicitly ask the student if the student would like you to report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator.Ask About Services. Explicitly ask the student if the student would like you to connect the student with confidential resources at Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services.Follow the Student\u2019s Wishes. If the student wants you either to make a report to the Title IX coordinator or connect the student with Crisis Intervention, or both, contact the appropriate office while the student is with you if possible, but in no event later than 24 hours after the student expressed this wish. If the student does not give consent to make such a connection, then the employee shall not disclose the information to others except as described below. If there is any ambiguity about the student\u2019s answer, the employee should engage the student in further conversation to get clarification.Closing Words. At the end of the conversation, let the student know that the student can contact you again in case the student has further questions, identifies other needs for resources or assistance, or decides to report the incident.Call to Confidential Resource.\u00a0 In order to insure that the above has been done properly and because a faculty or staff member may need assistance responding to the student, the employee must contact either Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services or another confidential resource who is identified by the Title IX Coordinator and listed on the safe.uoregon.edu Web site, preferably immediately and when the student is still with the employee.\u00a0 Conversations with the professional at Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services or with the other confidential resource should occur in a de-identified manner (i.e., without identifying identities or detail).\u00a0 The employee should explain the purpose of the call to the student and inform the student that the person being called is a confidential resources.\u00a0Exemption.\u00a0 The Title IX Coordinator has the authority, and absolute discretion, to grant an exemption from this requirement for employees who seek it.\u00a0 The granting of the exemption shall be based upon the employees\u2019 knowledge of this policy and knowledge of the University\u2019s resources and response protocol.\u00a0Confidentiality Unless there is a Request to Report or Imminent Risk. Unless a student asks a Student-Directed Employee to share disclosed information with a specified office or person, the Student-Directed Employee shall not do so, unless the employee believes the student has conveyed information about an imminent risk of serious harm or the student is under 18 years of age and the student discloses \u201cabuse\u201d as defined by state law.In the instance when the student has conveyed information about an imminent risk of serious harm, the employee shall ask the student for permission to convey the information to an appropriate office, such as Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services or law enforcement, and shall discuss with the student other ways in which the risk can be minimized. If the student refuses to have an appropriate office contacted, and the employee feels that an imminent risk of serious harm remains, then the employee may call the appropriate office and disclose the information received.In the instances where the student is under 18 years of age and discloses \u201cabuse,\u201d the employee shall follow state law. See Other Resources, \u201cChild Abuse Reporting,\u201d below.Student-Directed Employees may still have certain reporting obligations under the Clery Act. For information about the Clery Act and who is a Campus Security Authority with reporting obligations, who is a confidential employee for Clery Act purposes, and what the reporting obligations are for a Campus Security Authority (e.g., Clery reports generally do not contain personally identifying information), see Related Resources, \u201cClery Act,\u201d below.While students have the option to share their experience with a Student-Directed Employee who is not a Designated Reporter, a Student-Directed Employee is not meant to be someone who can redress the prohibited conduct. Consequently, in almost all instances, these employees are not permitted to report the underlying actions to others unless the student asks for that to occur, which means that the University may not be able to take action to stop the discrimination or harassment, remedy its effects or prevent future instances of the discrimination and harassment because the University will likely not know about the underlying behavior.Further, students who discuss their situations with a Student-Directed Employee always retain the choice to make a complaint directly to the Title IX office (see Related Resources, \u201cTitle IX Coordinator,\u201d below) or to seek support services from another appropriate office (such as Crisis Intervention and Student Survivor Support Services). Students who file complaints or otherwise receive support services from the University will be protected from retaliation.Obligations of Confidential EmployeesStudents and Employees have the option to share their experience with a Confidential Employee. Confidential Employees have the same obligations as Student-Directed Employees. These obligations are described above under Part III.C.However, Confidential Employees\u2019 professional obligations may provide students with a greater level of confidentiality because these employees have a professional obligation to maintain client confidences and often a legal privilege of confidentiality. Prior to the student\u2019s disclosure, Confidential Employees should explain to the student the Confidential Employee\u2019s professional obligations regarding confidentiality and the limits of those obligations.Unless the student requests that the Confidential Employee report to the Title IX office, in most instances, Confidential Employees will not report the underlying actions to others, which means that the University may not be able to take action to stop the discrimination or harassment, remedy its effects or prevent future instances of discrimination and harassment because the University will likely not know about the underlying behavior.Further, Students who report to Confidential Employees always retain the choice to make a complaint, as explained in Related Policies and Procedures, \u201cDiscrimination Complaint and Response,\u201d below. Students, Employees and Campus Community Members with questions regarding the University\u2019s processes are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator. For further information regarding Confidential Employees\u2019 privacy practices, please visit the Web site referenced below under Other Resources, \u201cPrivacy Practices.\u201dWe recognize that students who experience Prohibited Discrimination, Discriminatory Harassment or Sexual Harassment within departments, institutes, programs, residence halls, employment or sports teams face unique obstacles. The University wants to ensure that students know they can report their experiences and\/or seek support outside their academic departments or units in which they work or go to school as well as outside their residence halls, programs, or teams. With this in mind, we encourage students experiencing Prohibited Discrimination, Discriminatory Harassment or Sexual Harassment to utilize the confidential resources available to them in order to explore forms of support and protection and to fully understand their options relating to filing a complaint or seeking out support outside their own work, academic, or other similar environment. In addition, students may choose to file a complaint directly with the Title IX Coordinator, or to seek out a Designated Reporter or Student-Directed Employee in another unit, or directly contact Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services.In some instances, employees who are not Designated Reporters, including Confidential Employees, will have reporting obligations under the Clery Act as Campus Security Authorities. For more information, see Other Resources, \u201cClery Act,\u201d below.General Obligations of Employees and FacultySyllabus. If a faculty member or instructor has a syllabus, then the faculty or instructor is strongly encouraged to put the following statement on the syllabus:\u201cAny student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and\/or sexual harassment may seek information and help at https:\/\/safe.uoregon.edu. A student can also call 541-346-SAFE, UO\u2019s 24 hour hotline to be connected to a counselor.\u201d Faculty should remove from their syllabi language that inaccurately identifies them as a \u201cresponsible employee\u201d\/Designated Reporter. Faculty are encouraged to make clear on their syllabi that GTFs are not Designated Reporters (i.e., responsible employees) under this policy. If a faculty member is a Designated Reporter, the faculty member is strongly encouraged to make that status clear on the syllabus.Training. All employees shall take periodic training offered by the Title IX office and the Office of Human Resources regarding this policy, available resources, and trauma-informed responses to student disclosures. The training shall be approved by the Title IX Coordinator after consultation with a committee of experts in the field of sexual and gender-based violence and the Vice President for Equity and Inclusion. The frequency and timing of these trainings will be determined by the Title IX Coordinator and the Office of Human Resources and will not conflict with restrictions or obligations set forth in the University\u2019s collective bargaining agreements.Annual De-identified Reports. In order to identify patterns or systemic problems, the Office of the Title IX Coordinator will solicit annual reports from Student-Directed Employees of aggregate data, including general information about incidents of sexual violence such as the nature, time, date and general location of incidents if identified during conversations. These reports should not include personally identifiable information about students, and employees should consider what information needs to be withheld to protect identities. For this reason, Employees should keep de-identified information that will be responsive to the Title IX Coordinator\u2019s request for data.Failure to Comply. If the University finds that an Employee has failed to comply with the provisions of this policy, it will take immediate and appropriate corrective action. This means that Designated Reporters who fail to report as required by this policy may be subject to discipline, which may include a letter of reprimand or other appropriate corrective measures. Student-Directed Employees who fail to comply with the terms and obligations set forth in this policy may be subject to discipline, which may include a letter of reprimand or other appropriate corrective measures. Confidential Employees who fail to comply with the terms and obligations set forth in this policy may also be subject to discipline, which may include a letter of reprimand or other appropriate corrective measures.Obligations of the University AdministrationUpdate Materials. The University shall update written materials and SAFE.uoregon.edu to have clear and accessible information for students and employees that reflects this policy. The University shall also add information to the Web site relating to the statute of limitations for reporting harassment and sexual or domestic violence to the University, police, or civil courts, as well as how to access assistance for issues specific to minors.FAQs. The University shall provide specific examples relating to the policies and procedure to illustrate how the policy works. The materials shall include a FAQ section for employees and students.Web-based Reporting. As soon as reasonably possible, the University shall make accessible to students a secure and confidential Web-based reporting system. This system should include a way for students to confidentially store their disclosures in an information escrow system, preferably through a third-party vendor. This system should also include an on-line reporting option, an option for students to trigger a report when the name of an accused person is reported more than once to the system, and links to both on-campus and off-campus resources. The Title IX Coordinator or designee shall enter all received reports into the information escrow system as soon as practicable to minimize the chance of any orphan reports.Title IX Ambassadors.\u00a0 The University shall consider using \u201cTitle IX Ambassadors\u201d who would supplement the training provided by the University.\u00a0 Title IX Ambassadors would be employees of the University who, under the direction of the Title IX Coordinator, would provide information to other University employees on the policy, resources, and the mechanics of a trauma-informed response.\u00a0 This would constitute service to the University and should be recognized as such.Stickers. The University shall provide stickers to all Designated Reporters for their door to identify themselves as Designated Reporters.Periodic Review.\u00a0 The University Administration shall initiate a review of this policy, in consultation with the University Senate, at least once every seven years.Contract Consistency. To the extent that this policy is inconsistent with any existing contractual obligations of employees, the University shall renegotiate those terms as soon as practicable and to the extent possible.Indemnification of Employees. Consistent with and subject to the limitations set forth in ORS \u00a7 30.285, the University shall defend, hold harmless and indemnify employees subject to an action arising out of an alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of the employee\u2019s duties, including their duties described in this policy.Obligations of Supervisors Relating to Workplace Harassment of Student Employees.Because of Title VII and state employment law, and consistent with University policy, sexual harassment in the workplace is strictly prohibited. Supervisors of student employees impacted by or accused of Prohibited Discrimination in the workplace and Designated Reporters are always required to report Reportable Evidence of Prohibited Discrimination in the workplace to the Title IX Coordinator.\u00a0 Employees, including student employees, who have been subject to workplace harassment or other forms of Prohibited Discrimination are always encouraged to file complaints with their supervisor or with the University directly. See below, Related Policies and Procedures, for more information regarding how to file complaints. All Employees reporting sexual harassment in the workplace will be protected from retaliation.Procedures for reporting workplace harassment of student employees are as follows:Report to Direct Supervisor. If the student employee discloses information regarding workplace harassment to the student\u2019s Supervisor, as defined in this policy, or to the Supervisor of the alleged harasser, or to a Designated Reporter, the Supervisor or Designated Reporter must promptly report to the Title IX office.

Telecommuting is defined as work and transportation alternatives that substitute home-to-work commuting with the option of working at home or at satellite work locations for all or part of the employee's assignment. This policy applies to classified employees and officers of administration. Supervisors and employees are encouraged to refer to Office of Human Resources document \"Telecommuting Guidelines\" for more information.Procedures and Requirements: 1. Telecommuting Agreement A University of Oregon Telecommuting Agreement must be signed by the employee, his or her supervisor, and dean\/director\/department head. Signed telecommuting agreements should be submitted to the Office of Human Resources.The employee, supervisor, or dean\/director\/department head may terminate the telecommuting agreement at any time with reasonable notice.Telecommuting is a voluntary option and does not include work at home due to temporary special conditions such as inclement weather, recovery from illness, caring for an ill family member, or caring for a newborn or newly adopted child.2. Work Assignments and Supervision 1. The telecommuter and his or her supervisor shall mutually agree upon modes of communication (i.e., telephone, fax, network access, or e-mail).a. A consistent schedule of hours shall be established.\u00a02. During established work hours, family care demands shall not compete with work except in the case of emergency. Telecommuting shall not be a substitute for day care. Other personal business shall not be conducted during scheduled work hours.3. The employee may be required to attend department meetings. Travel expenses incurred by the telecommuter for campus meetings are his or her responsibility.3. Work Space and Equipment A designated work space shall be maintained by the telecommuter that is conducive to working and free of hazards.Office supplies will be provided by the University of Oregon; however, out-of-pocket expenses for supplies normally available in the office will not be reimbursed. The University shall not provide office furniture.Generally, a telecommuter will provide their own telephone service, however departments may chose to pay for alternative or additional service.Generally, a telecommuter will provide his or her own computer equipment and software. Any arrangements otherwise must be approved by the dean\/director\/department head and a Property Receipt must be completed and submitted to the Office of Business Affairs for the use of university property at off-campus sites. Computers used for University of Oregon business must have acknowledged computer safety precautions (such as UL approved surge protector) and virus protection.University computer modem usage is limited to 14 hours per week. If work from home requires heavy computer use, telecommuters or their departments must buy modem access via commercial provider, departmental sponsored modem pool, or other evolving solutions approved by the university's Telecom and Network Service Departments.Telecommuters will not hold business visits or meetings with professional colleagues, customers or the public at home work sites; meetings with other UO staff must be approved in advance by the supervisor. Teleconferences are acceptable methods for meetings.4. Conditions of Employment and Pay Status The criteria for evaluation of the telecommuter's performance shall be the same as for on-site employees.All employment responsibilities and conditions (e.g., compensation, benefits, vacation, rights, and privileges and disciplinary procedures) apply at the telecommuting site.Classified and non-exempt employees shall fill out time sheets indicating actual hours worked each day with breaks and meal periods taken as appropriate. Overtime work for non-exempt employees must be pre-approved by the supervisor.Classified employees shall be covered under all provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.5. Work Site Safety, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Because the employee's home work space is an extension of the university, the telecommuting employee is covered by workers' compensation insurance during the course and scope of employment, during the approved work schedule, and in the designated work location. The telecommuter is responsible for immediately informing his or her supervisor of any work-related injury or illness.To ensure safe working conditions exist, the University of Oregon retains the right to make on-site visitation of the home work space.6. Liability Unless otherwise agreed in writing prior to any loss, damage, or wear, the University of Oregon does not assume liability for loss, damage, or wear of employee-owned equipment.7. SecurityRestricted-access materials shall not be taken out of the office or accessed through the computer unless approved in advance by the supervisor.Telecommuters are responsible for making sure that non-employees do not access University of Oregon data, either in print or electronic form.8. Assessment and Evaluation a. A review process shall be established between the employee and supervisor to evaluate the telecommuting arrangements and to assure that work standards continue to be met. It is recommended that evaluation meetings be held at least every three months during the first year of the telecommuting agreement.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a004\/27\/1999Issued by:\u00a0Vice-President for AdministrationRevision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.710 to 03.12.03Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

When legal names are still listed on class roll sheets and in the public Find People directory, it causes repeated and undue \u2018outing\u2019 every time a student starts a new class or anyone looks them up in the directory. \u00a0The proposed policy takes into account the UO\u2019s legal requirements and would not interfere with records where legal names are required (payroll and other official documents), allows the UO to deny requested first names when appropriate, but would allow more flexibility to list students with their preferred name only whenever possible.\u00a0II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Policy StatementThe university recognizes that many persons use first names other than their legal names to identify themselves. As long as the use of this preferred first name is not for an improper purpose, is not restricted by state or federal law and does not have an impact on the ability of the university to comply with state or federal law, the university will use \"preferred first name\" when possible in the course of university activities.\u00a0Therefore, it is the policy of the university that any current or former student or employee may choose a preferred first name in addition to that person\u2019s legal name listed within the university\u2019s information systems. The person's preferred first name shall be used in university communications and reporting except where the use of the legal name is required for university purposes. (Please refer to FAQ for further details.)\u00a0The university reserves the right to remove a preferred name if it is used improperly, including but not limited to, avoiding legal obligations or misrepresentation.\u00a0III.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What Is a Preferred First Name?A current or former student or employee may prefer to use a first name that is different from their legal name. Also, they may want to have this first name appear instead of their legal first name in the online directory and in other university records and documents. The university allows them to do this by setting a preferred first name. They should set the preferred first name in DuckWeb and it will then appear in the online directory and other records, such as Blackboard and the class roster. Some records, such as paychecks and financial aid documents, that require use of a legal name, will not include the preferred first name.\u00a0IV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Setting a Preferred First NameUse Duckweb to set the preferred first name online. All individuals may do this under the personal information tab.\u00a0 If Duckweb is unavailable, a current or former employee may contact the payroll office in order to change preferred name and a current or former student should contact the registrar\u2019s office.\u00a0V.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Display of the Preferred First NameOnce established, preferred name will be used across university systems, where possible.\u00a0 The legal names will continue to be used for certain university records, documents, and business process where use of legal name is required by law or university policy.\u00a0VI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Frequently Asked Questions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can any member of the UO community set a preferred first name?Individuals who have access to Duckweb can set preferred first names.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I set my preferred first name to whatever I want?Yes, but the university reserves the right to remove a preferred first name if it is used for an improper purpose (such as for misrepresentation).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I use my preferred first name for everything at the university?No. Your legal name will continue to be used in business processes that require use of the legal name, such as for payroll records and student transcripts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do I need to know about my ID card?If you choose to utilize the preferred first name at the UO your UO ID card can no longer be used as proof of legal identity.\u00a0 This would impact its use as a form of ID for employment verification or other uses for those who do not have other forms of picture ID.e.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do I correct or change my legal name for university systems?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students\u00a0can file a name change form through the Registrar's website or by email (registrar@uoregon.edu) or by phone (541 346-2935)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ii.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employees, including student employees can file a legal name change by completing the Address\/Personal Data Form available on the Human Resources.\u00a0(Note: this form has not yet been created.

If the student possessed the necessary academic credentials at the time of death, and if the family wishes, the Vice President for Student Life shall recommend that the University President authorize the posthumous issuance of the degree.To receive a posthumous degree, at the time of death, the University Registrar must confirm that a student was (a) officially enrolled or (b) actively pursuing degree completion and within two terms of degree completion, that is, the current term and one additional term\/semester.If the student meets the above criteria, the University Registrar shall consult with the student\u2019s major department(s), and the dean of the Graduate School or Law School when appropriate, to evaluate the student\u2019s academic record to determine if satisfactory completion of current course and\/or completion of one additional term\/semester would have satisfied all major course requirements as stipulated by the department(s).\u00a0 If a thesis or dissertation would have been required for graduation, the dean of the Graduate School or Law School shall consult with the chair and members of the thesis or dissertation committee to determine whether the student could have completed and defended the thesis or dissertation during the current or subsequent term or semester.\u00a0The relevant dean(s) and department chair(s)\/head(s) shall be notified of a final determination.Exclusions and Special Situations:\u00a0Exceptions to the policy will be made by the University President based on a recommendation by the Provost.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 1: Curriculum and instruction\nRelated Resources:\u00a0To initiate the process, please contact the Office of Student Life: (541) 346-3216.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Policy renumbered from 571.023 to III.05.05.Technical revisions enacted by the University Secretary on September 3, 2015.Became a University of Oregon Policy by operation of law on July 1, 2014.Former Oregon Administrative Rule Chapter 571 Division 23.Policy:\u00a0A. Definitions\u00a0(1) \"Dean's Consultation\" occurs when the Dean of Students convenes a group of professionals to recommend actions and strategies to respond to a student's failure to meet the University's Standards of Responsibility and Self Care.(2) \"Medical Leave\" means leave during an academic term, resulting from a student's medical or mental health condition that requires the student to interrupt their enrollment.\u00a0(3) \u201cStandards of Responsibility and Self Care\u201d means that a student in the University community is experiencing a serious medical or mental health condition or emergency that substantially threatens the welfare of self or others and\/or significantly disrupts the functioning of University operations.(4) \"Vice President\" means Vice President for Student Life or successor or designee.(5) \u201cDean of Students\u201d means the Associate Vice President & Dean of Students or successor or designee.B. Voluntary Medical LeaveA student who wishes to be placed on Voluntary Medical Leave from the University shall contact the Dean of Students and, if requested, present a recommendation to that effect from a physician or psychologist.The Dean of Students may request the Executive Director of the University Health Center (if the request for leave is based on a medical condition) or the Director of the University Counseling and Testing Center (if the request for leave is based on mental health conditions) or both (if the Dean of Students believes information from both directors would be useful) evaluate the information provided.Once the Dean of Students grants the student's request, they will work with the student on a plan for return and plan for success upon such return, as appropriate, in accordance with Section I below, regarding Resumption of Student Status.C. University Duties of Refund and Other Academic AlternativesIf a student is placed on leave from the University pursuant to the provisions of UO Policy 571.023(B) or (G), the Dean of Students is authorized to instruct the University Registrar, when necessary, to withdraw the student immediately and to initiate the appropriate tuition and fee refund according to the University refund schedule, or explore and\/or implement alternative or additional reasonable accommodations, as may be warranted in the circumstances.D. Standards of Responsibility and Self Care(1) A student in the University community who does not meet University Standards of Responsibility and Self Care, unless such a student elects voluntary leave, may be referred for a professional assessment or placed on Emergency Temporary Medical Leave or Mandatory Leave.In evaluating whether a student does not meet University Standards of Responsibility and Self Care, the University will make an individualized and objective assessment of the student\u2019s ability to participate in the University\u2019s programs and activities, based on reasonable medical judgment or the best available objective evidence.\u00a0 The assessment will determine the nature, duration and severity of the risk, the probability that the potential harm will actually occur and, if a qualifying disability exists, whether reasonable accommodations can be implemented to mitigate the risk sufficiently to allow the student to continue to access University programs and activities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The involuntary Emergency and Mandatory Leave processes are not a substitute for disciplinary action when there is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct, and the disciplinary process is separate from the process outlined here.\u00a0 Because conduct that gives rise to Emergency or Mandatory Leave might also result in Student Conduct sanctions, it is possible that a student who has met the designated conditions for reenrollment following an Emergency or Mandatory Leave may not be eligible for reenrollment based on the conduct sanction administered.E. Emergency Temporary Leave(1) The Dean of Students may take emergency action to place a student on Emergency Temporary Leave when necessary to secure the health or safety of the student or others. At the time that the emergency action takes place, the Dean of Students shall (A) inform the student of the reason for the emergency action, (B) give the student the opportunity to explain why emergency action need not be taken, and (C) inform the student that the meeting outlined in the Mandatory Leave Procedure section below will take place within three (3) business days of the Emergency Action if the student is available, or if the student is unavailable for medical reasons, within three (3) business days after the student becomes available.(2) Mandatory Leave. If the Dean of Students believes a student\u2019s medical or mental health issues substantially threaten the welfare of self or others and\/or significantly disrupts the functioning of University operations, the Dean of Students may place a student on mandatory leave after following the procedures identified in Section I.F. Involvement of Emergency ContactsAlthough rare, the Dean of Students may need to contact a student\u2019s emergency contact for students who are experiencing medical or mental health emergencies. The decision to notify a student's emergency contact in the case of a medical or mental health emergency will be weighed carefully against the student's privacy rights and other relevant information and will be done consistent with the requirements of state and federal law and university policy.G. Mandatory Leave Procedure(1) If the Executive Director of the University Health Center or the Director of the University Counseling and Testing Center believes the standard for mandatory leave has been met by a student\u2019s behavior, the director will recommend that the Dean of Students initiate mandatory leave. In some instances, both the Mandatory Leave and Student Conduct procedures may be triggered by the student\u2019s conduct.\u00a0 The Student may also be placed on emergency temporary suspension by the Dean of Students or designee in the interim, pursuant to the Emergency Action provisions of the Student Conduct Code or the Emergency Temporary Leave provision, discussed above. The director may confer with any individuals the director believes can assist in making a recommendation.(2) The Dean of Students will request the director prepare a report containing a summary of the steps already taken to respond to the student's medical or mental health issues, a list of individuals who have relevant information regarding the student's medical or mental health issues, and the basis for recommending mandatory leave.(3) The director will set a date and time for a meeting with the student prior to making a final recommendation regarding Mandatory Leave and provide the student written notice. The notice shall include:(a) The date, time and place of the meeting;(b) That the purpose of the meeting is to consider if the student should be placed on Mandatory Leave;(c) That the standards for making the final decision are whether the student's medical or mental health issues substantially threatens the welfare of self or others, or significantly disrupts the functioning of University operations: and(d) That the student has the opportunity to attend, to participate in the meeting, and to be accompanied by a personally-selected representative.\u00a0 Should the student elect not to attend the meeting, the process will proceed without the benefit of the student\u2019s input, with the director\u2019s evaluation based on the information otherwise available.(4) The director shall conduct the meeting in an informal manner that provides the director with an opportunity to gather information relevant to the final decision and provides the student with an opportunity, if the student wishes, to provide information the director or student believes will be useful in making a final recommendation. The student's opportunity to participate in the meeting shall include the opportunity to provide information from others who may have knowledge regarding whether the student's medical or mental health issues substantially threatens the welfare of self or others and\/or significantly disrupts the functioning of University operations.(5) If the director concludes that the student's medical or mental health condition does not substantially threaten the welfare of self or others, nor significantly disrupts the functioning of University operations, the director will so advise the\u00a0 Dean of Students in writing.\u00a0 The Dean of Students will decide whether to enforce the mandatory leave and inform the student of the decision.(e) If, following the meeting with the student, the director concludes that the student's medical or mental health condition substantially threatens the welfare of self or others, or significantly disrupts the functioning of University operations the director will so advise the Dean of Students in writing, and may recommend the student be placed on mandatory leave. The Dean of Students will decide whether to enforce the mandatory leave and inform the student of the decision.\u00a0(f) A student may appeal the Dean of Student\u2019s determination regarding Mandatory Leave or the conditions placed on the Student\u2019s return, pursuant to I below, to the Vice President. Such an appeal must be filed within 14 days.\u00a0 The Vice President shall review all available information provided by the Dean of Students and the affected student and may request an opportunity to request additional information from the Dean of Students and the affected student.\u00a0 The Vice President's decision is final.H. Resumption of Student Status(1) Prior to returning to the University or enrolling at the University, a student who has been placed on leave as a result of emergency procedures, voluntary leave, or mandatory leave must produce a plan in writing that delineates how the student will resume their status at the University.(2) The plan must respond to the condition that gave rise to the need for the student's leave (i.e., need for ongoing psychological or medical care; ability to maintain a standard of responsibility and self-care; ability to assume class participation.) If the student will reside in the residence halls, the plan must also state how the student will transition back into this community.(3) The Dean of Students and counseling (for psychological conditions) or health (for medical conditions) center director or their designees will review the student's plan and meet with the student. The student will be asked to authorize the counseling or health center director or designee to consult with the student\u2019s recent\/current mental health or medical providers about mental health issues relevant to the student\u2019s readiness to return to the University. After the Dean of Students and counseling or health center director have reviewed the student's plan, the Executive Director of the University Health Center (for behavior based on medical issues or emergencies) or the Director of the University Counseling and Testing Center (for behavior based on mental health issues or emergencies) or both (if the Dean of Students believes information from both directors would be useful) will make a recommendation to the Dean of Students, who will decide if the student's request to re-enroll at that time shall be granted or denied.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 5: Student Records\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Multiple Contracts, purchase orders, or purchasing requisitions will not be issued separately with the intent to circumvent this policy.(a) $25,000 or less \u2014 Direct Procurement or other method of procurement that the University deems beneficial to the procurement.(b) $25,000.01 to $100,000 \u2014 Informal Procurement, Formal Procurement, or other method of procurement, except the Direct Procurement method, that the University deems beneficial to the procurement.(c) Greater than $100,000 \u2014 Formal Procurement or other method of procurement, except the Direct Procurement or Informal Procurement methods, that the University deems beneficial to the procurement.(3) In accordance with ORS 279C.800 et seq, projects having a total Contract Price more than $50,000, or on a project where the combined Contract Price of all contracts awarded on the project is more than $50,000, will be subject to the Bureau of Labor and Industries Prevailing Wage Laws. Projects may not be divided into more than one Contract to avoid the application of this subsection. Projects funded in part or wholly by federal funds will comply with the higher of the state or federal prevailing rate of wage.(4) No Contract will be awarded to any construction firm that is not licensed to do business in the State of Oregon, not registered or licensed by the appropriate state licensing boards, or listed as ineligible to enter into Contracts or Public Improvement Contracts by the Bureau of Labor and Industries.(5) Contractors will post and maintain performance and payment bonds as required in the Solicitation Document. For Public Improvement Contracts with a total Contract Price in excess of $100,000, one hundred percent performance and payment bonds will be required.H. Oregon\u2019s Percent for ArtThe \"Percent for Art\" legislation governed by ORS 276.073 through 276.090, guides the acquisition of Oregon's state art collection. For acquisition of art work in applicable state buildings, this program sets aside no less than 1 percent of the construction funds of buildings with a construction budget of $100,000 or more. The University will be responsible to ensure compliance with the \"Percent for Art\" for applicable projects.I. Design StandardsAll major facility projects will be planned, designed, constructed, and renovated to meet high performance building standards for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability as defined by the Department of Energy and the State of Oregon.(1) State Energy Efficiency Design is the policy of the State of Oregon that facilities to be constructed or purchased by authorized state agencies be designed, constructed, renovated, and operated so as to minimize the use of nonrenewable energy resources and to serve as models of energy efficiency per ORS 276.900 through 276.915.(2) Green building design and construction is an integral part of University\u00a0 Capital Construction. University projects should consider design standards that incorporate the 'Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design' (LEED) Silver standards or higher standards, which promote buildings that significantly reduce or eliminate the negative impact of buildings on the environment and occupants.J. Retainage Processing Charges(1) The University may require a retainage for Construction-Related Services Contracts under $1,000,000. For Construction-Related Services Contracts over $1,000,000, the University will withhold a retainage.(2) The University will not retain an amount in excess of five percent (5 percent) of the Contract Price for Work completed. If the Contractor has performed at least fifty percent (50 percent) of the Work and is progressing satisfactorily, upon the Contractor's submission of Written application containing the surety's written approval, the University may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate retainage on any remaining progress payments. The University will respond in Writing to all such applications within a reasonable time. When the Work is ninety-seven and a half percent (97.5 percent) completed, the University may, at its discretion and without application by the Contractor, reduce the retained amount to one hundred percent (100 percent) of the value of the remaining unperformed Work. The University may at any time reinstate retainage. Retainage will be included in the final payment of the Contract Price.(3) For Construction-Related Services Contracts over $1,000,000 the Contractor may request that the retainage be deposited in an interest-bearing account at a financial institution. Title to such funds will remain with the Board until the Work is complete and accepted by the University. Interest on deposited retainage accrues to the benefit of the Contractor and will remain in the retainage account until the Work is accepted. The University may deduct fees necessary to open and maintain an interest-bearing account.(4) Alternatives to cash retainage. In lieu of cash retainage to be held by the University or financial institution, the Contractor may substitute one of the following:(a) Deposit of securities:(A) The Contractor may deposit bonds or securities with the University or in any bank or trust company to be held for the benefit of the Univeristy. In such event, the University will reduce the retainage by an amount equal to the value of the bonds and securities, and reimburse the excess to the Contractor.(B) Bonds and securities deposited or acquired in lieu of retainage will be of a character approved by the Controller's Office, including but not limited to:(i) Bills, certificates, notes, or bonds of the United States.(ii) Other obligations of the United States or its agencies.(iii) Obligations of any corporation wholly owned by the federal government.(iv) Indebtedness of the Federal National Mortgage Association.(C) Upon the University\u2019s determination that all requirements for the protection of the Institution\u2019s interests have been fulfilled, it will release to the Contractor all bonds and securities deposited in lieu of retainage.(b) Deposit of surety bond. The University, at its discretion, may allow the Contractor to deposit a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Institution in lieu of all or a portion of funds retained or to be retained. A Contractor depositing such a bond will accept surety bonds from its subcontractors and suppliers in lieu of retainage. In such cases, retainage will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the bond and the excess will be reimbursed to the Contractor.(5) The University will recover from the Contractor all costs incurred in the proper handling of cash retainage and securities, by reduction of the final Contract payment.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The University further recognizes the right of members of the public to enter the campus of the University and to engage in lawful and peaceful activities while there. It is the belief of the administration of the University of Oregon that encouragement of these rights will lead to a broader, richer education for its students. Rights do not exist without responsibilities, however. Nor is the University without an obligation to provide a safe, private, scholastic environment in which its students may pursue their studies without interference. To insure that both the rights and the responsibilities are satisfied as fully as possible, the University has adopted the following rules concerning public access to the campus. They are designed to strike a balance which will provide free access and protect the educational environment without sacrificing one to the other.(1) Definitions. As used in this policy, the following definitions apply:(a) \"Sale\", \"selling\", or \"purchasing\" mean an activity which creates an activity or obligation to transfer property or services for a valuable consideration;(b) \"Commercial solicitation\" means any direct and personal communication in the course of a trade or business reasonably intended to result in a sale;(c) \"Private sale\" means occasional selling between persons who are campus students or employees;(d) \"Commercial transactions\" means selling or purchasing or both selling and purchasing by any person in the course of employment in, or in the carrying on of, a trade or business. To the extent a non-profit organization or charity is selling a tangible product or is offering a tangible product with the expectation of thereby obtaining an immediate and direct contribution, this aspect of the entity's activity shall be deemed for the purposes of this policy to be a commercial transaction;(e) \"Interference standard\" describes the basis on which University officials will make an activity impact judgement (i.e., extent to which an activity or proposed activity limits, impedes or makes more costly than normal the use or function of an area);(f) \"Charitable solicitation\" means any direct and personable communication in the course of the operations of a not-for-profit organization reasonably intended to result in a sale or monetary contribution;(g) \"Not-for-profit organization\" means any group of individuals, formally or informally organized for the purpose of promoting the well-being of the public at large or for benefitting an indefinite number of persons, including but not limited to educational, literary or scientific purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the benefit of religion, rehabilitation services, public recreation, civic improvement or services which lessen the burdens on government, and also means any entity to whom a donation would qualify for a tax credit under ORS 316.102.(2) Commercial and charitable solicitation and commercial transactions are prohibited on campus except upon written application by the vendor or solicitor and with written permission by the University President or the President's designated representative. The President has designated the Director of Erb Memorial Union as the Official designee to carry out the provisions of this policy. The Director of Erb Memorial Union shall, when the facilities affected are other than those of Erb Memorial Union, consult with the appropriate administrator:(a) The application shall include:(A) The applicant's name, address, and tele-phone number;(B) The name, address, and telephone number of the company or organization represented by the applicant;(C) The purpose of the visit to campus;(D) The type of activity to be engaged in;(E) The duration of the visit; and(F) Any other information which is relevant to the granting or denial of permission to engage in the above-mentioned activities.(b) Permission shall be granted if the proposed activity:(A) Aids achievement of the educational or cultural objectives of the campus;(B) Does not interfere with the operations of the campus;(C) Is not prohibited by law or rule or policy;(D) In the case of commercial solicitations and for-profit commercial transactions, pays the University a minimum of rental for use of space, or ten percent (10%) of gross proceeds, whichever is greater;(E) Does not conflict with terms of other contracts for sales or services already at the University;(F) In the case of commercial solicitations and for-profit commercial transactions does not continue more than two (2) days and is not a frequently requested privilege. In the case of charitable solicitations and not-for-profit charitable transactions which occur on a continuing or repeated basis, permission must be reobtained at the beginning of each academic term;(G) Does not conflict with similar sales or services offered by departments of the University.(3) Any person granted permission under section (2) of this policy to engage in commercial or charitable solicitation or commercial transactions must abide by any time, place or manner restrictions which may be imposed as a condition to the granting of such permission. These restrictions include, but are not limited to, the number of presentations within a given period of time as determined by the Director of Erb Memorial Union in consultation with other University administrators whose unit may be affected.(4) Commercial and charitable solicitation and commercial transactions are prohibited in all areas where such activity will, or is likely to, interfere with the normal functions of that area. Such areas include, but are not limited to:(a) Individual student rooms, hallways, stairwells and lavatories in the dwelling areas and the interior and food service areas of dining rooms in residence halls. Use of residence hall lounges and meeting rooms will be allowed only with the permission of the Director of Housing (using an interference standard) and a majority vote of the residents of that unit. Use of dining hall lobbies will be allowed only with permission of the Director of Housing, applying the same standard;(b) Classrooms, except with written permission of the Director of Erb Memorial Union and written consent of the instructor;(c) Meeting rooms, auditoriums, or general assembly areas except with written permission from the Director of Erb Memorial Union;(d) Libraries;(e) Faculty and administrative offices; and(f) Any other areas designated by the President or the Director of Erb Memorial Union on behalf of the President.(5) Persons who violate the provisions of this policy shall be disciplined as follows:(a) Members of the campus community shall be disciplined in accordance with the procedure which is appropriate with that person's status as a student, faculty member, administrator, employee, or other category;(b) Non-members of the campus community shall be prohibited from entering upon the campus for purposes of commercial and\/or charitable solicitation or commercial transactions for a period of not more than one year. Those who violate this prohibition shall be subject to trespass laws.(6) Nothing in this policy shall affect private sales.(7) Nothing in this policy shall affect advertising in campus newspapers, radio or television stations.(8) Nothing in this policy shall affect commercial solicitations and commercial transactions by vendors providing sales and services to offices, employees or agents of the University of Oregon for the conduct of University business.(9) Commercial and charitable door-to-door solicitation in Family Housing areas shall be managed as follows:(a) Each person desiring to solicit door-to-door must fill out a request-to-solicit form at the area office once a year. Forms record applicant's name, address and telephone number; company name, address and telephone number; purpose of visit; type of activity and length of visit;(b) The area director will file each request and will permit any person or group to solicit door-to-door once an academic term. Solicitors will receive a written approval pass which should be carried and displayed on request during the course of their visit to the Family Housing Area;(c) Solicitors may return to established customers without reapplying for permission, but shall renew the request-to-solicit form the same month each year.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The Program Officer may designate other representatives of the Institution to oversee and coordinate particular elements of the Program. Any questions regarding the implementation of the Program or the interpretation of this document should be directed to the Program Officer or his or her designees.Scope of Program: The Program applies to any record containing nonpublic financial information about a student whether in paper, electronic or other form, that is handled or maintained by or on behalf of the Institution or its affiliates. For these purposes, the term nonpublic financial information shall mean any information (i) a student provides in order to obtain a financial service from the Institution, (ii) about a student resulting from any transaction with the Institution involving a financial service, or (iii) otherwise obtained about a student in connection with providing a financial service to that person.Policy: The Program Officer will oversee and coordinate a comprehensive written information security program as mandated by the Federal Trade commission's Safeguards Rule and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.Elements of the Program:1. Risk Identification and Assessment. The Institution intends, as part of the Program, to undertake to identify and assess external and internal risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of nonpublic financial information that could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, destruction or other compromise of such information. In implementing the Program, the Program Officer will establish procedures for identifying and assessing such risks in each relevant area of the Institution's operations, including:Employee training and management. The Program Officer will coordinate with institutional representatives to evaluate the effectiveness of the Institution's procedures and practices relating to access to and use of student records, including financial aid information. This evaluation will include assessing the effectiveness of the Institution's current policies and procedures in this area, including, 05.00.04, Student Records Policy and UO Policy 571.020, (Student Records.Information Systems and Information Processing and Disposal. The Program Officer will coordinate with representatives of the Computing Center to assess the risks to nonpublic financial information associated with the Institution's information systems, including network and software design, information processing, and the storage, transmission and disposal of nonpublic financial information. This evaluation will include assessing the Institution's current Acceptable Use Policy, Records Retention Policy and procedures for Confidential Document Destruction.

Designing and Implementing Safeguards. The risk assessment and analysis described above shall apply to all methods of handling or disposing of nonpublic financial information, whether in electronic, paper or other form. The Program Officer in coordination with appropriate institutional representatives will, on a regular basis, evaluate safeguards to control the risks identified through such assessments and to regularly test or otherwise monitor the effectiveness of such safeguards. Such testing and monitoring may be accomplished through existing network monitoring and problem escalation procedures.3. Overseeing Service Providers. The Program Officer shall coordinate with those responsible for the third party service procurement activities among relevant parties (e.g. the Business Affairs Office) and other affected departments to raise awareness of, and to institute methods for, selecting and retaining only those service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate safeguards for nonpublic financial information of students.

To assist faculty in meeting this responsibility, the University is committed to offering regular training opportunities pertaining to both research-related and teaching-related computing, and considers participation in these trainings a form of service involving a contribution to faculty development.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 6: Information technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

When inclement weather occurs, geographic location and elevation can vary conditions significantly. The University of Oregon makes decisions based on its campus conditions, which may not be the same decision by nearby school districts, colleges or universities.The President of the University designates the Vice-President for Finance and Administration as the administrative officer responsible for the decision about delayed opening or closure and implementation of this policy.If a change in operating status is warranted, the Vice President for Finance & Administration has three options: a delayed opening, early closure, or a full closure.Academic and administrative units shall abide by any decision made by central administration regarding operating status. If a unit cannot safely maintain operations, the Dean or Director can choose to open later than the campus wide opening, close earlier than the campus wide closing, or fully close instead of delayed opening or closing early. Deans and Directors are responsible for communicating their status to their own employees. This deviation from the campus wide status must be communicated to the Incident Management Team (IMT).In the case of inclement weather, the following services and resources are considered essential:Campus Planning and Facilities ManagementCentral Power StationSafety and Risk ServicesHousing and Dining ServicesInformation ServicesResearch (e.g. Animal care facilities)\u00a0UO Police DepartmentIncident Management TeamWhen it is possible to maintain safe operations, the following campus services will open and provide as many services as possible for the student population: Erb Memorial Union and Student Recreation Center.\u00a0DEFINITIONSDelayed Opening:\u00a0 A university operating status based upon inclement weather or other emergency that cancels classes and events, and suspends all non- essential administrative and academic activities at the Eugene campus in the morning hours of normal operations.\u00a0\u00a0Early Closure:\u00a0 A university operating status based upon inclement weather or other emergency that cancels classes and events, and suspends all non- essential administrative and academic activities at the Eugene campus in the afternoon and\/or evening hours of normal operations.\u00a0Full Closure:\u00a0 A university operating status based on inclement weather or other emergency that cancels all classes and events and closes all university offices and departments, except select emergency and essential services.Essential Services and Resources: Services and resources necessary to maintain health and safety and residential and research support functions on campus.\u00a0 Departments and units with designated essential services and resources are responsible for developing their own protocol and procedures for maintaining their essential functions.Essential Employee: University employee whose duties are required to provide essential services and resources.RESPONSIBILITIESVice President for Finance & Administration (VPFA): Makes final decision regarding the operating status of the university and when to resume normal operations. The VPFA has the responsibility to evaluate extenuating circumstances and scheduled programming with input from the Incident Management Team for services and resources considered essential to fulfill operational needs.UO-Incident Management Team (IMT): Provides the command and control infrastructure that is required to manage the logistical, fiscal, planning, operational, safety and campus issues related to any and all incidents\/emergencies. The IMT monitors the situation and advises the Vice President for Finance & Administration when a decision regarding a change to the operating status is advisable.Deans and Directors: Within the unit for which they have responsibility, maintain the same operating status that has been declared by the university. When a change in operating status has been declared, maintain a schedule within the unit that is consistent with this policy.SPECIAL SITUATIONSSupervisors and faculty should be reasonably understanding and flexible regarding a student\u2019s or staff member's individual needs during inclement weather or an emergency, especially if the student or employee has a long commute to and from campus. A student, faculty or staff member who believes that it is unsafe to travel, or who is faced with unexpected family care responsibilities (such as those created by local school closings), should use his or her judgment and remain at home if that is the most prudent action.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 7: Property, facilities and planning; sustainability\nRelated Resources:\u00a0Closure Reference Tables.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

AuthorityThis Policy concerning faculty records conform to and are governed by ORS 351.065 and the policies of the University of Oregon (University).B. Definitions(1) \"Directory Information\" is that information generally needed in locating a particular academic staff member, including information found in the University Catalog, Time Schedule of Classes, and Telephone Directory.(2) \"Records of Academic Achievement\" are limited to the information as to the number of credits earned toward a degree or in post-doctoral work, and certificate(s), diploma(s), license(s), and degree(s) received.(3) \"Salary Information\" shall include the rate of pay and terms and conditions of employment.(4) \"Personal Records\" are all other records containing information concerning an academic staff member, apart from those identified above.Personal records include but are not limited to: Information kept by the University, college, or school, department or division concerning a specifically identifiable faculty member and furnished by the staff member or by others at the University's, college's or school's, department's or division's, or at the staff member's request. Personal records include but are not limited to: information as to discipline, counseling, membership activity, other behavioral records, professional preparation and experience, professional performance (e.g., assignment and work-load, quality of teaching -- including records tabulated from students' classroom survey evaluations -- research, and service to the institution), personnel data relating to such matters as promotions, tenure, leaves, retirement credits and the like, and professional activities external to the institution, including but not limited to, awards, recognition, research activity, or travel.C. Faculty Records \u2013 Restrictions on Use(1) Directory Information, Records of Academic Achievement, and Salary Information, as defined within Section B , may be released upon request and without the faculty member's consent.(2) Personal records, as defined in Section B, are hereby designated as confidential in order to protect privacy rights in an adequate educational environment. Access to personal records shall be restricted as hereinafter set forth in Sections E, F, G, and H.D. Faculty Records \u2013 Restrictions on Content(1) Only such records as are demonstrably and substantially relevant to the educational and related purposes of the University, college or school, division or department, shall be generated and maintained.(2) No faculty member shall be required to give -- although the staff member may voluntarily provide -- information as to race, religion, sex, political affiliation or preferences, except as required by valid state or federal laws, rules, regulations, or orders. In those instances in which the faculty member is asked for such self-designation for any purpose (including federal requests for information), the request shall state the purpose of the inquiry and shall inform the individual of the right to decline to respond. Except as the faculty member makes the foregoing information available, there shall be no designation in faculty personal records as to the faculty member's race, religion, sex, or political affiliation.E. Personal Records \u2013 Restrictions on Access(1) Personal records (except privileged psychological and medical records which are subject also to additional restrictions on access) shall be available only to University personnel such as faculty administrators, students and others serving on official institutional committees or in other official institutional capacities who have a demonstrably legitimate need for particular information in order to fulfill their official, professional responsibilities.(2) Contents of personal records shall also be available to the faculty member who is the subject of the records as herein provided, in Section F and for research purposes as provided in Section G.(3) Personal records may not be released to any other person or agency without the faculty member's written consent, unless upon receipt of a valid subpoena or other court order or process or as required by valid state or federal laws, rules, regulations, or orders.(4) Upon receipt of a subpoena or other court order or process seeking access to faculty personal records, the recipient, if legally permissible, must take reasonable efforts to notify the subject faculty member and must notify the President or his designated representative prior to any institutional responses. The latter will determine whether or not appropriate University personnel should appear in court to test the validity of the subpoena or court order or process.(5) The appropriate Vice President shall have the authority to determine the legitimacy of any disputed request for access to the personal records of a faculty member.F. Personal Records \u2013 Access by Subject Faculty Member(1) Each faculty member shall be provided full access to his or her personal records, as defined in Section B as designated confidential in Section C and maintained according to the provisions of Sections H and I, except as limited below in this Section F. Such records shall be made available for inspection or copying at a reasonable time and place upon request to the custodian of said records.(2) Evaluative statements submitted in confidence by individuals prior to July 1, 1975, or prior to employment of the faculty member if after July 1, 1975, to the University, college or school, division or department, either at the request of the faculty member or at the request of the President or a Vice President, Dean, Division or Department Head, concerning the subject faculty member's teaching or other professional performance, scholarship, or service, and supplied with the understanding that the substance of the evaluative statement will be available to the subject faculty member upon request, shall be maintained as part of the faculty member's personal records, but the identity of the evaluator shall not be revealed to the subject faculty member.(3) Upon the request of the subject faculty member, if employed prior to July 1, 1975, the full text of evaluative statements supplied prior to July 1, 1975, shall be made available to him or her by the appropriate Vice President, Dean or Department Head except that portions of the text which would serve to identify the contributor shall first be excised by a three- person subcommittee of the Faculty Personnel Committee (or three faculty members acting as its designees) and placed in the confidential file permitted by University policy. Also upon request of the faculty member, the same subcommittee shall examine the contents of the faculty member's confidential file to verify that it contains only those excised portions defined in this section. The committee shall have the authority to require that any other material be removed from the confidential file. Upon request of the faculty member, the same subcommittee shall examine the contents of the faculty member's closed personal records to verify that the staff member has been given the text of all statements therein, and if not, they shall provide the faculty member with a statement of the substance thereof.(4) Confidential letters or other information received by the institution, school, department, or division after July 1, 1975, prior to the employment of a faculty member, shall be placed in the evaluation files relating to the faculty member. If the applicant is not employed, the confidential information submitted concerning the applicant shall remain confidential. If an applicant who is employed requests access to his or her files, the anonymity of the contributors of confidential preemployment letters and other preemployment information shall be protected. The full text shall be made available by the appropriate Vice President, Dean, or Department Head, except that portions of the text which would serve to identify the contributor shall be excised and retained in the confidential file permitted by University policy.(5) A faculty member shall be entitled to submit, for placement in his or her files, evidence rebutting, correcting, amplifying or explaining any document contained therein and other material which the member believes might be of assistance in the evaluation process.(6) A copy of the regular written evaluation of the faculty member made by the supervising administrative officer, shall be given to the faculty member, and a copy of the evaluative statement, duly signed by the faculty member signifying that the staff member has been given a copy thereof shall be placed in the faculty member's personal records. Each such regular written evaluation shall contain or have attached to it a statement to the effect that:(a) At the faculty member's option the evaluative statement may be discussed with the evaluating administrator and that;(b) The substance of any confidential evaluative statements in the closed portion of personal records shall be made available to the faculty member upon request and that;(c) The faculty member may have entered into the staff member's personal records a rebuttal, refutation, or explanation of any regular written evaluation or any confidential evaluative statement therein.(7) Any evaluation received by telephone shall be documented in each of the faculty member's files by means of a written summary of the conversation with the names of the conversants identified.(8) Except as provided in ORS 351.065, the University and its subdivisions when evaluating its employed faculty members shall not solicit or accept letters, documents, or other materials, given orally or in written form, from individuals or groups who wish their identity kept anonymous or the information they provide kept confidential.(9) If the institution, school, department, or division solicits or accepts student evaluations of the classroom or laboratory performance of a faculty member, such evaluations or surveys shall be conducted anonymously. The record of reports tabulated from student evaluations shall be placed in at least one of the evaluation files defined in University policy. All survey instruments from which evaluation data are obtained shall be delivered to the faculty member. No other evaluative material shall be accepted from students unless the students are first clearly informed that the faculty member will have access to such material and that the anonymity of the student cannot be preserved.(10) The appropriate Vice President shall be the person to whom requests for information shall be addressed under University policy concerning personnel actions affecting categories of faculty members where such actions appear to have relevance to the case of the faculty member making the request for information. The supplying of such information may be limited where the burden of complying with such requests would unreasonably impede the normal functioning of University business.G. Personal Records \u2013 Access for Research PurposesInformation about faculty members for research purposes may be provided, contingent upon the existence of adequate provisions to conceal from the person(s) doing the research, the identity of the individual faculty members whose personal data or information are being included in the research. Research requests may also be limited where the burden of complying with such requests would unreasonably impede the normal functioning of University business. If the confidentiality of faculty personal records would be jeopardized in any way by the release of the information for research purposes, the written consent of the faculty member must be obtained prior to the release of information. All such requests for information must be submitted to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost, who will obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty committee on human research before releasing any information from personal records for research purposes.H. Personal Records \u2013 Location and Custody(1) All faculty personal records shall be kept within the Vice Presidential, College or School division, or department offices in which they are utilized.(2) Each Vice President, Dean, Director, or Department Head shall be the official custodian of the personal records contained within the operating unit, unless another person is specifically designated, in writing, by such Vice President, Dean, Director, or Department Head, to assume his responsibility.(3) The custodian of personal records shall maintain them in a manner which shall insure their confidentiality and security.(4) Any person, including administrative and clerical personnel, seeking access to personal records for authorized purposes, shall first secure the consent of the custodian.(5) The term \"file\" as used in this section is understood to mean a physical repository containing comprehensive personal records relating to a faculty member's qualifications, competence, and performance in his or her professional capacity. The number of files relating to the evaluation of a faculty member, or to each component of the separate assignments of faculty members with split or joint appointments, shall be limited to a total of three, except for a file designated pursuant to University policies for the maintenance of material properly held confidential or excised from other records. All files shall be kept in designated and accessible places.I. Personal Records \u2013 Permanence, Duplication, and Disposal(1) The individual faculty member's personal record shall be maintained only for the minimum period of time required to serve the basic official functions for which the records were generated.(2) The permanent retention of faculty personal records shall be limited to those which the President, the University Archivist, or the State Archivist shall determine to be of long-range value to the individual faculty member, to the University, or to the public.(3) Duplication of permanent faculty personal records shall be permitted only when such records are required to serve the official functions of the office which maintains them and when the custodian has given his consent.(4) Duplicate permanent records, evaluative statements and other similar personal records not designated for permanent retention shall not be maintained for a period longer than ten years without the approval of the President or the President's designee. All such records which have been maintained for a period of twenty years shall be disposed of in such a manner as to protect their confidentiality.J. Fee for CopiesWhere a faculty member requests copies of materials under Sections F and G, the University may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the actual cost of providing the material.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Confidentiality is central to the effective provision of health care and survivors\u2019 services. Providers of health care and\/or survivors\u2019 services have a duty to carry out the obligations of confidentiality imposed by law, professional codes of ethics, and this policy. In most circumstances, providers involved in the care of clients\/patients shall not disclose information without written authorization from the client\/patient. Disclosures made pursuant to exceptions arising from federal and state laws or professional codes of ethics shall be limited to the minimum information necessary.Litigation and ConfidentialityWhen the University of Oregon is involved, or anticipates being involved in a legal proceeding, the University of Oregon has chosen to uphold a more protective standard with regard to confidential health care and survivors\u2019 services information than may be required under state and federal laws, and professional codes of ethics. The following describes the standards that the University of Oregon will follow in relation to legal proceedings or anticipated legal proceedings.If information needs to be preserved, the University of Oregon will implement a litigation hold. General Counsel will direct appropriate university personnel outside of the Office of General Counsel to \u2018hold in-place\u2019 all potentially relevant confidential records and\/or direct relevant Information Technology staff to institute an \u201cIT hold\u201d for such records, in order to ensure compliance with a litigation hold. Each unit that creates or maintains such records will develop a litigation hold-in-place procedure to be approved by General Counsel.In response to an actual or anticipated lawsuit, board complaint, or other legal proceeding initiated by a client\/patient regarding the provision of health care and\/or survivor's services (i.e. professional negligence related to these services), the University of Oregon may access and use that client\/patient's confidential health and\/or survivors\u2019 services information related to such services to defend itself and those who provide services in a manner consistent with state and federal law, and professional ethics.\u00a0 The University will access the information via a subpoena whenever it is possible to issue a subpoena.\u00a0 If it is not possible to issue a subpoena, the University will provide the client\/patient notice and an opportunity to object to accessing the information before any accessing of the information occurs.When the University of Oregon is a party (or may become a party) to a lawsuit with a claim that is not covered by paragraph #2, and receives a subpoena or request from an outside party for records that include confidential health care and\/or survivors\u2019 services information, the University, its health centers\/clinics, providers, and confidential responders will, if there is a good faith basis under applicable law, resist subpoenas or other requests, notify the client\/patient of the subpoena or request,\u00a0 inform the client\/patient of their right to seek independent legal advice, and release privileged information only in response to an order from a court or tribunal, a stipulated protective order that the client\/patient has signed, or a written authorization from the client\/patient. \u00a0Prior to any access by University officials, in cases of a disagreement with General Counsel, in order to ensure that the University respects legal and professional obligations to protect confidentiality a provider\/custodian of record may request University funding for independent legal counsel concerning the disclosure of records. Denial of such a request may be appealed to the University President.In instances not covered by paragraph #2, if existing law (e.g., FERPA, HIPAA, state law) allows University officials to access a client\/patient\u2019s confidential health care and\/or survivors\u2019 services information, University officials will forgo access without a stipulated protective order that the client\/patient has signed, a written authorization from the client\/patient to use the records, or a court order. Prior to any access by University personnel, in cases of a disagreement with General Counsel, in order to ensure that the University respects legal and professional obligations to protect confidentiality a provider\/custodian of record may request University funding for independent legal counsel concerning the disclosure of records. Denial of such a request may be appealed to the University President.\u00a0When the University of Oregon is a non-party in a legal proceeding (i.e., neither the plaintiff nor the defendant) and receives a subpoena for records that include confidential health care and\/or survivors\u2019 services information, the University of Oregon will, if there is a good faith basis under applicable law, resist subpoenas or other requests, notify the client\/patient of the subpoena or request, inform the client\/patient of their right to seek independent legal advice, and release privileged information only in response to\u00a0 an order from a court or tribunal, a stipulated protective order that the client\/patient has signed, or a written authorization from the client\/patient. Prior to any access by University officials, in cases of a disagreement with General Counsel, in order to ensure that the University respects legal and professional obligations to protect confidentiality a provider\/custodian of record may request University funding for independent legal counsel concerning the disclosure of records. Denial of such a request may be appealed to the University President.Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require those subject to this policy to violate any state or federal legal or ethical obligations.\u00a0 Nor shall this policy be construed to limit the ability of a provider to act in the best interests of the provider\u2019s client\/patient, consistent with state and federal law.Nothing in this policy shall be construed to limit the ability of a University health center or clinic to obtain professional liability and\/or general liability insurance coverage and comply with the terms of that coverage, including consulting outside counsel or other medical professionals for risk mitigation, or to establish, at the health center or clinic\u2019s option, a risk management team that operates inside any center or clinic.\u00a0 University employees selected by the center or clinic to participate on and provide support services to such a team (e.g., risk management, compliance, administration, information technology, billing) will have access to health and\/or survivors\u2019 services information only within the physical confines of the respective center and only after the name and any other identifying information, as much as is feasible in the circumstances, of the client\/patient has been removed from such information.Advice and Information for Clients and PatientsConfidentiality is a complex issue, and the issues can vary depending on the specific services that a client or patient receives, the records created as part of those services, and the laws that apply. Thus, it is essential that clients\/patients discuss confidentiality with their specific providers. It is also important that clients and patients served by University of Oregon clinics, health centers, and confidential responders know who has access to information that clients\/patients share with their providers, and under what conditions confidential information may be used or disclosed. University of Oregon health centers, clinics, and confidential responders will provide written information to every client\/patient that describes the confidentiality of the client\/patient's health care or survivors\u2019 services information and provides a link to this policy.Implementation and Review of University of Oregon Health Center, Clinic, or Confidential Responder Confidentiality Policies and PracticesEvery health center, clinic, or confidential responder (i.e., unit) that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits confidential health information must have policies and practices in place that follow all applicable state and federal laws, reflect the highest professional standards of confidentiality, and comply with this policy.DefinitionsFor purposes of this policy:Confidential health and\/or survivors\u2019 services information is information that is \u201cpersonally identifiable\u201d to the client\/patient at the time it is disclosed, as that term is used by the applicable state and federal law governing the specific information.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 5: Student Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The requirement to safeguard information resources must be balanced with the need to support the pursuit of legitimate academic objectives. The value of data as an institutional resource increases through its widespread and appropriate use; its value diminishes through misuse, misinterpretation, or unnecessary restrictions to its access.Classification of DataAll University data is classified into levels of sensitivity to provide a basis for understanding and managing University data.\u00a0 Accurate classification provides the basis to apply an appropriate level of security to University data.\u00a0 These classifications of data take into account the legal protections (by statute or regulation), contractual agreements, ethical considerations, or strategic or proprietary worth.\u00a0 Data can also be classified as a result of the application of \u201cprudent stewardship,\u201d where the best reason to protect the data is to reduce the possibility of harm to individuals or to the institution.\u00a0Classification LevelsThe classification level assigned to data will guide Data Trustees, Data Stewards, Data Custodians, business and technical project teams, and any others who may obtain or store data, in the security protections and access authorization mechanisms appropriate for that data. Such categorization encourages the discussion and subsequent full understanding of the nature of the data being displayed or manipulated.\u00a0 Data is classified as one of the following:Public (low level of sensitivity) Public data is not considered confidential. Examples of Public data include published directory information and academic course descriptions. The integrity of Public data must be protected, and the appropriate Data Trustee or Steward must authorize replication of the data. Even when data is considered Public, it cannot be released (copied or replicated) without appropriate approvals.Internal (moderate level of sensitivity) Access to \u201cInternal\u201d data must be requested from, and authorized by, the Data Trustee or Steward who is responsible for the data.\u00a0 Data may be accessed by persons as part of their job responsibilities. The integrity of this data is of primary importance, and the confidentiality of this data must be protected. Examples of Internal data include purchasing data, financial transactions (that do not include sensitive data), and information covered by non-disclosure agreements.Sensitive (highest level of sensitivity) Access to \u201cSensitive\u201d data must be controlled from creation to destruction, and will be granted only to those persons affiliated with the University who require such access in order to perform their job, or to those individuals permitted by law. The confidentiality of data is of primary importance, although the integrity of the data must also be ensured. Access to sensitive data must be requested from, and authorized by, the Data Trustee or Steward who is responsible for the data. Sensitive data includes information protected by law or regulation.In addition to the Sensitive classification, there are two subsections of Sensitive data.Regulated sensitive data includes data governed by state or federal law such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, and the Oregon Consumer Identity Theft Protection Act. It also may be governed by other federal, state, or local laws, or contractual obligations.Unregulated sensitive data includes data that is not regulated by statute, but still considered sensitive due to proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations.\u00a0 This generally includes all forms of research.Data Associated with Selected RegulationsHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): Personal Health DataFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA): Student Data (Education Records)Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): Credit Card DataGramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA): Financial Data, Social Security NumbersOregon Consumer Identity Theft Protection Act (CITPA): Social Security number,\u00a0Driver license number,\u00a0state identification number, Passport number\/U.S.-issued,\u00a0identification number,\u00a0Financial DataData Security Recommendations for the Classification LevelsThe Chief Information Security Officer will create and maintain security procedures for the various types of data use by the University.\u00a0 These are the Minimum Security Procedure for Devices with Sensitive Information and Minimum Security Procedure for Devices with Public or Internal Information.\u00a0 In addition, a security guide is available for the handling of physical data.\u00a0 This is the Minimum Security Procedure for Handling Physical University Data.\u00a0 Finally, Information Services has developed an Employee Electronic Records Access Procedure.Roles and Responsibilities\u00a0Chief Information Security OfficerThe Chief Information Security Officer implements policies and procedures to comply with the various state and federal laws and regulations applicable to the University of Oregon.Data TrusteeThe Data Trustee for all University data is the Provost or their designees who have planning, policy-level and management responsibility for data within their functional areas.\u00a0 Data Trustee responsibilities include:Assigning and overseeing Data StewardsOverseeing the establishment of data policies in their areasDetermining statutory and regulatory requirements for data in their areasPromoting appropriate use and data qualityData StewardsData Stewards are University officials having direct operational-level responsibility for the management of one or more types of data.\u00a0 Data Stewards must be authorized by the appropriate Data Trustee and are generally associate deans, associate vice presidents, directors or managers.\u00a0 Data Steward responsibilities include:The application of this and related policies to the systems, data, and other information resources under their care or controlAssigning data classification labels using the University's data classification methodologyIdentifying and implementing safeguards for Sensitive DataCommunicating and providing education on the required minimum safeguards for protected data to authorized data users and data custodiansAuthorize access, both logical and physical, only to authorized personnel who have a business need to access specific data or other information assetsAuthorize remote access to information assets to only Authorized Personnel who have a business need to access specific data through a secured system approved by the Chief Information Security Officer of the UniversityIn cases where multiple Data Stewards collect and maintain the same sensitive data elements, the Data Stewards must work together to implement a common set of safeguards.Data CustodiansData Custodians are Information & Technology or computer system administrators responsible for the operation and management of systems and servers which collect, manage, and provide access to University data.\u00a0 Data Custodians must be authorized by the appropriate Data Stewards.\u00a0 Data Custodian responsibilities include:Maintaining physical and system security and safeguards appropriate to the classification level of the data in their custodyComplying with applicable University computer security standardsManaging Data Consumer access as authorized by appropriate Data StewardsFollowing data handling and protection policies and procedures established by Data Stewards and Information SecurityData ConsumersData Consumers are the individual University community members who have been granted access to University data in order to perform assigned duties or in fulfillment of assigned roles or functions at the University.\u00a0 This access is granted solely for the conduct of University business.\u00a0 Data Consumer responsibilities include:Following the policies and procedures established by the appropriate Data Stewards and Information Security;Complying with federal and state laws and regulations, and University policies associated with the University data used;Implementing safeguards prescribed by appropriate Data Stewards for Sensitive Data;

At the same time, UAS and model aircraft present unique health and safety risks, environmental risks, regulatory issues, and privacy concerns that must be balanced with the University\u2019s other missions. \u00a0The University of Oregon is committed to providing an academically vigorous, safe, and secure environment for all individuals.\u00a0 Inherent risks in operation of UAS and model aircraft necessitate proper safety practices, privacy restrictions, insurance protections, and requisite oversight of and authority for operation of UAS and model aircraft on University property, University sponsored events, or offsite in support of the University\u2019s research, teaching, and business activities.Operation of UAS and model aircraft is regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) and federal, state, and local laws. \u00a0The University shall develop procedures to comply with this Policy and all applicable statutory and regulatory expectations governing the operation of UAS and model aircraft, and to reduce risks to safety, security, and privacy.Any UAS or model aircraft operation by University employees, students, volunteers, vendors, and all visitors (invitees and licensees) must be approved in advance by Safety and Risk Services\u2019 (\u201cSRS\u201d) Chief Resiliency Officer (or their designee) through the UAS Procedures referenced below.\u00a0 All such operations must also comply with all federal, state, and local laws and University policies.\u00a0GUIDELINESI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office of the

Campuses would provide a brief (two-page) narrative description of the proposed program: what the program is intended to do, how the proposed program furthers the strategic directions of the institution, the resources needed to support the program within existing budgets, and an analysis of outcomes for graduates including employment prospects.The Academic Council will discuss, semi-annually, the proposed programs at the September and January meetings.B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Board will discuss semi-annually the planning proposals with the presidents\/chief academic officers and Board's staff during a work session twice a year at the October and February Board meetings. The Board's discussion would include an informal staff report of the Academic Council's discussion. The Board will provide direction to campuses for those proposals that should be developed as full proposals, including a timeline for implementation.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Campuses will commit to a timeline for implementation of the proposed program (e.g., typically a two-year limitation).C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs will analyze and review fully developed plans for proposed programs that the Board has authorized for planning. After the review has been completed satisfactorily, the program will be recommended for implementation to the Board. Campus plans will follow the protocol currently in use.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Academic Council will discuss the plans for new degree programs as part of the review process.D.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When a new degree program is ready for implementation (i.e., analyzed, reviewed, and ready for staff recommendation to the Board), the Board will review the recommendation for authorization to implement the new degree program.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Board will not consider any request for authorization to begin a new degree program that was not previously approved for planning, except under extraordinary circumstances of clearly demonstrated urgency.E.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New degree programs will be evaluated within five years of implementation, unless the need for an earlier evaluation is suggested by changes in circumstance.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Under current Board policy, a follow-up analysis of a new academic program is conducted not longer than five years after implementation.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To the extent possible, similar programs on other OUS campuses will be evaluated at the same time.\u00a0F.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The start date for the proposed Program Development Review process is January 1996. The first discussions of the planning proposals using this process will be conducted in January 1996 by the Academic Council and in February 1996 by the Board, presidents\/chief academic officers, and Board\u2019s staff. Because a small number of new academic programs are well along in the current planning process, programs ready before the start date for the new process will be presented to the Board as they become ready.\u00a0[1] At the present time, under Board policy, new degree programs include baccalaureate, professional, and graduate degrees of all types, certificates, and educator endorsements.Cross Reference to Related Policies:\u00a0Policy DocumentOriginal Source:\u00a0OUS Board Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Preamble:UO Policy II.07.02 states that it is the university\u2019s intent to, \"establish principles and procedures for equitably sharing net royalty income with employees, and with sponsoring agencies when required by an agreement.\" Royalty income shall be defined as cash royalties and fees. The policy further states the following: Employees [inventors and authors] shall be eligible to share in net royalty income from each invention or separate improvement thereof, an amount not to exceed:(a) 40% of the first $50,000, 35% of the next $50,000, and 30% of all additional net royalty income received by the Board for inventions and technological improvements; and(b) 50% of net royalty income from educational and professional materials.Persons entitled to share in this distribution of net royalty income include: faculty, staff, assistants, graduate teaching fellows, graduate research assistants, and student employees.The employee's share of net royalty income referred to above is the maximum percentage of net royalty income allowed for distribution to inventors and authors. Hence, this amount shall be divided between said inventors or authors, should there be more than one, in an amount agreed upon in writing by all the inventors and authors.Section 6.250, (3) of the Internal Management Directives (IMDs) defines net royalty income as gross royalty income received by the University minus the following costs: all institutional expenses and reasonable costs incurred in developing the invention or material, expenses incurred in [obtaining], enforcing or defending any patent, copyright litigation, licensing, interference, and marketing costs attributable to the invention or material, as well as any other expenses deemed necessary to recoup. In the normal situation this means repayment of the direct expenses paid by the University to attorneys for the filing and prosecution of the patent applications, or registration of copyright or trademark.Section 6.250, (6) of the IMDs states that, \"net royalty income received by the Board, less the amount distributed, if any shall be dedicated to the institution of the inventor, or author, subject to the limitation of ORS 351.250. The use made of such net income shall be at the discretion of the president, subject to Board-established budget policy.\"III. Distribution of Net royalty income Less Distribution to EmployeesUnder this policy, the employees' share of net royalty income will normally be (a) 40% of the first $50,000, 35% of the next $50,000, and 30% of all additional net royalty income received by the Board for inventions and technological improvements; and (b) 50% of net royalty income from educational and professional materials (\"Employee's Share\"). In addition, if equity is granted pursuant to the granting of a license, the Employee's Share of the equity will normally be one-third of the total equity granted. It is the expected that the employee will not receive consideration for the technology as it exists at the time of the licensing agreement, in addition to his\/her Employee Share. However, it is understood that an employee may participate with an entity which is further developing the technology, and may receive consideration for that participation.Net royalty income and equity less the Employee's Share constitutes the \"University's share\" of net income and equity. The University's share of net income shall be distributed as follows:(a) 50% to the employee's academic unit (\"Unit Share\"); and(b) 50% to the University (\"Central Share\").The University's Share of equity will normally be held by the University of Oregon Foundation which will be responsible for distributing the income from such equity, if and when available, with the concurrence of the Vice Provost for Research, following the policies above for the distribution of royalty income.Where there is more than one inventor or author and they are affiliated with different academic units, the Unit Share shall be divided between the academic units in accordance with the percentage each inventor contributed to the invention, technological improvement, or creative work (i.e., educational material, or professional material). Ideally, the Unit Share shall be used to support the continued research\/ developmental activity of the inventor(s)\/author(s).Where an inventor or author is affiliated with more than one academic unit, the Unit Share shall go to the academic unit (e.g., department, institute, etc.) which fostered most of the said inventor's or author's work on the project. If such a determination cannot be made, then the Unit Share shall go the inventor's or author's primary unit. Where an inventor or author has left the University prior to its receipt of gross royalty income, subject to distribution hereunder, his\/her Unit Share shall remain with the respective academic unit.While the distribution of the Central Share shall normally be made to the University's patent budget, some or all of these dollars may be reallocated at the discretion of the Vice Provost for Research.Collaborations frequently occur between employees of the University and other institutions or corporations. In such cases, the University may be required to share its portion of gross royalty income with another party under a joint exploitation agreement. In these cases, the managing partner under such an arrangement may be required to first distribute the partner's income prior to deduction of its valid costs and subsequent distribution of net royalty income.Distribution of net royalty income shall be made at least once annually. Inventors\/authors receiving such monies from licensing revenues shall assume full responsibility therefore (e.g., tax consequences).Notwithstanding the foregoing, net and gross royalty income can also be held back to cover anticipated reimbursable, but not yet incurred, costs associated with a particular technology.IV Examples of Distribution of Royalty Income1. The Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) receives a check for $75,000 for a license fee (gross royalty income) called for under a newly executed license agreement. The license is for patented technology developed by Dr. X from the Department of Chemistry and Dr. Y from the Materials Science Institute (MSI). OTT has expended $10,000 on patent costs thus far and the licensee has agreed to pay future patent costs directly. The revenue shall be distributed as follows:$75,000 minus $10,000 for patent expenses incurred by OTT leaves $65,000 net royalty income for distribution to faculty\/inventors, the departments (Unit Share) and the University (Central Share).Amount first $50,000 remain. $15,000______________________________________Faculty 40% 20,000 35% 5,250Dr. X (60%) (12,000) (60%) (3,150)Dr. Y (40%) (8,000) (40%) (2,100)Unit Share 30% 15,000 32.5% 4,875Chem (60%) (9,000) (60%) (2,925)MSI (40%) (6,000) (40%) (1,950)Central Share 30% 15,000 32.5% 4,875______________________________________Total 100% 50,000 100% 15,000note: amounts in parenthesis are subtotals.______________________________________Reminder: net royalty income for inventions is distributed to inventors at the rate of 40% of the first $50,000, 35% of the next $50,000, and 30% of amounts over $100,000. For educational and professional materials, which are typically protected by copyright, 50% of net royalty income is distributed to the authors.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 7: Intercollegiate athletics\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Parental responsibilities for a new baby or child, however, may lessen a faculty member's scholarship for a period of time. In acknowledgement of this possibility, the University, at the request of the faculty member, will consider entering into a special agreement to extend the probationary period for one year before mandatory consideration for indefinite tenure is given. In cases deviating from normal full-term childbearing, a faculty member can request a similar extension which may be granted at the discretion of the Provost. Requests for an extension may be made for each new baby or child.Procedure, Period of Leave, and Rescission of Agreement: A faculty member who requests an extension of the tenure probationary period must initiate the request no later than twelve months after birth or adoption of a new baby or child. The request should be addressed to the Provost. Any request for leave without pay that is combined with a request to suspend the tenure clock under this policy shall in no case lead to a suspension exceeding twelve months, as specified above. The agreement for the extension of the probationary period may be rescinded by the faculty member at any time by submitting written notice to the Provost.\u00a0Exclusions and Special Situations:\u00a0This policy will apply only to those non tenured faculty members who are in regular tenure-related, fixed-term appointments. The Rules provide that the tenure probationary period may be altered \"in individual cases (where) there is a specific written agreement between the institution and the faculty member\".Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a002\/01\/2000Revision History:\u00a002\/19\/1985\u00a0 Promulgated10\/04\/1985\u00a0 Revisions reviewed and approval recommended by President's StaffFebruary 2000\u00a0 Revisions reviewed and approval recommended by President's StaffReissued by Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost02\/08\/2010\u00a0 Policy number revised from 3.130 to 02.01.0510\/05\/2010 Changed Title from Extension of Tenure Probationary Period Because of New Baby or Childbirth or AdoptionOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

While privacy issues are governed by both state and federal law, the University's interest in privacy goes far beyond its commitment to comply with law. Privacy is an integral part of the academic freedom that is at the heart of the function of the modern University. Students, faculty and staff should be aware that the University supports their freedom to inquire, discuss and experiment with ideas without fear of improper government intrusion or public exposure. Though the University is supported by taxpayer funds, the mission of the University, as set out by the legal charter, centers on its autonomy as an academic institution governed by academic norms; that mission includes educating the larger community in the importance of academic freedom.Governmental initiatives may threaten some aspects of educational privacy. As a community, therefore, the University expresses its concern that, even during times of emergency, cooperation with law enforcement and political oversight of the University, while essential in a free society, should not go beyond the legitimate needs of outside bodies requesting information about University students, faculty and staff. Members of the faculty and the staff, in particular, should be aware that non-disclosure of confidential student information in response to outside inquiry by law enforcement or investigative agencies, except consistent with legal requirements, is the norm on this campus, and that the University will support all its members in their efforts to ensure that any request for records or information is submitted with proper authority and is no broader than is required by applicable law. Faculty and staff confronted with outside demands for information by law enforcement or investigative agencies must consult with the General Counsel's Office.Faculty and staff should in no case make any disclosure that has not been authorized by General Counsel's Office after examination of the justification for the demand. The General Counsel's Office will involve the President, to the extent permitted by law, in evaluating law enforcement subpoenas that impinge on traditional academic freedoms.Furthermore, the University recognizes that requests for information by outside agencies can raise difficult questions of conscience for those who have custody of confidential records. In no case will a specific member of the staff be required personally by the University to provide information in response to such inquiries when such personal compliance is not required by law. Compliance with information requests will be overseen by the office of the general counsel in accordance both with the law and with the norms of academic freedom, and the University will make every effort to provide information and support to the staff on the proper scope of their duties in this regard.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 5: Student Records\nOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Compensation Plan for Academic Staff(1) Pursuant to state law, the principles of a compensation plan are established for the academic staff as set out below. Pay ranges shall be established for the various academic ranks with due consideration given to relative responsibilities of each rank, prevailing rates of pay in other universities, colleges, and elsewhere for similar responsibilities, availability of a competent professional staff, living costs and other pertinent information.\u00a0(2) Minimum and maximum rates and such intermediate rates considered necessary and equitable shall be established for the various academic ranks and positions, provided, however, that exceptions may be allowed as circumstances require. Normally the established minimum pay rate for a rank shall be paid upon appointment. It is permissible in the interest of the state to make an appointment above or below the minimum rate for the academic rank. Similarly, the salary of an individual may be above or below the prescribed normal maximum for the academic rank. Normally, academic staff members shall be paid at one of the rates set forth in the pay ranges, subject to availability of funds and the exception noted above.\u00a0(3) Salary increases are not automatic. Increases shall be recommended only for staff members demonstrating high standards of work performance. Increases shall normally be effective beginning with the fiscal year following completion of one year's service.\u00a0(4) Implementation and amendments to the plan shall be based on recommendation of the President after consultation with division heads.\u00a0B. Compensation Plan for Classified StaffCompensation of classified employees including fringe benefits and other conditions and terms of employment shall be according to the rates and regulations in the state compensation plan, or by collective bargaining agreement, as appropriate.\u00a0C. Additional Pay to Full-Time StaffThe University and divisions are authorized to provide payment in addition to regular salaries when, at the request of the home institution or division or another Department institution or division, a staff member provides substantial service over and above the regular services expected.\u00a0D. Prerequisites When employees receive perquisites, such as living quarters or meals, in addition to cash salary, proper notation thereof shall be made on the salary budget together with an explanation showing items allowed and the value thereof. Granting of perquisites to employees on a wage or salary basis requires the approval of the President or head of the division concerned at the beginning of each fiscal year.\u00a0E. Contribution to Pension PlanThe Board designates the contribution required of employees to a retirement plan to be an \"employer contribution\" as defined by 26 USC \u00a7414(h)(2). Employees may not receive this amount to make the contribution directly. Employees' gross salary will be reduced by the contributed amount prior to reporting for tax purposes.\u00a0F. OSSHE Tax Deferred Investment Program Participation FeeThe Chancellor, or designee, may enter into written agreements with faculty and staff employed by the State Board of Higher Education, and with one or more insurance companies and mutual funds, to provide tax deferred investment opportunities to faculty and staff as provided by ORS 243.810 \u2013 243.830. The Chancellor, or designee, may, as a condition to entering into such agreements or continuing such agreements, require faculty and staff participants to pay annually an administrative fee for the costs of administrating the program. The administrative fee shall be based on an amount not to exceed the amount needed to administer the program.\u00a0G. Human Resources System(1) The Vice President for Finance and Administration, or designee, shall develop, implement and maintain a human resources system for nonacademic employees to include:(a) A job evaluation system for positions within the University;(b) A plan for compensating employees consistent with the job evaluation system; and(c) Policies for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements relating to leave, lay-offs, terminations, grievances and other terms of employment.\u00a0(2) The University is responsible for evaluating jobs and allocating them according to the job evaluation system and assuring that employee compensation is in accordance with the compensation plan.\u00a0(3) The Vice President for Finance and Administration, or designee, shall engage in collective bargaining with any certified or recognized exclusive employee representative.\u00a0(4) The University shall develop, implement and maintain recruitment and selection methods designed to achieve a qualified and diverse workforce.\u00a0(5) Until the Vice President for Finance and Administration, or designee, and the University implement internal management directives or policies for job evaluation, compensation, recruitment, terms of employment and position management, the rules and procedures established by the Department of Administrative Services, under ORS Chapter 240 as they existed on the effective date of 1995 Oregon Laws, Chapter 612 (July 1, 1995), shall apply to the University.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Failure to report when required to do so is a Class A violation. Persons who make reports in good faith are immune from liability for making the report. For instances that relate to UO-authorized activities, UO employees are expected to make the report immediately to the UO Police Department (541-346-2919).2.

Two levels of regular, developmental review are required of all tenured faculty who are not evaluated through the established Administrative Review process:A substantive review at the three-year point after a prior major review or after promotion. Other reviews (such as those undertaken for regular salary or merit-pay adjustments) may contribute to the third-year review, but may not be substituted for it.A major review every six years after a prior major review or after being promoted or receiving tenure.PREAMBLEA. Faculty Governance and the Responsibility of Educators: The University of Oregon Charter. The Charter of the University of Oregon, adopted in 1872, places the governance of the University in the hands of its faculty, with the President at its head. According to the Charter, \"The Faculty, consisting of the President and professors, shall be entrusted with the immediate government and discipline of the University.\" This system of governance imposes a solemn collective responsibility on the professors of the University of Oregon that is in addition to their individual responsibility to their students, their profession, and the larger society. The procedures described here are prepared with that responsibility of faculty governance in mind. Commitment to faculty governance requires substantial service obligations that must be recognized. The procedures are designed to help each professor, as an educator, more effectively discharge her or his individual responsibilities toward students, profession, and society.B. The Responsibility of Educators, Academic Freedom, and TenureIndividual Professional Responsibility. Society entrusts individual professors in its institutions of higher education with tasks of immense sensitivity: the education of its young people; the search for knowledge, wherever that search may lead; and the use of knowledge to help individuals and institutions in society progress and improve. To perform these tasks well requires a lifetime commitment to the profession of the scholar.Academic Freedom. To persuade the best scholars to devote their lives to this profession, the University guarantees a healthy measure of freedom in their professional lives. The protection of that freedom -- which is called academic freedom -- is both the precondition to excellence in the professoriate and the precondition to the education of continuing generations of free citizens, in a free society. Therefore, academic freedom is guaranteed not primarily to benefit the professors, but to ensure benefits to society as a whole.Academic Tenure. The primary method by which academic freedom is guaranteed is through a conditional grant of tenure with indefinite term. This grant of tenure is offered only to those professors who make it through a rigorous, probationary period. During that period, they bear the burden of proving their potential for lifelong excellence in teaching, research, and service. Those who sustain this burden of proof are then offered, in return, a commitment that the University will not later dismiss them without itself bearing a burden of proof that they are not performing as expected. Tenured professors are not guaranteed their jobs. They are, however, guaranteed that they will not be dismissed without academic due process. This guarantee is central to academic freedom and the societal benefits that it generates.Evaluation. In addition to the rigorous evaluation undergone by professors who obtain tenure, professors are continually evaluated by their students, by their local peers, and by a wide range of peers in their profession on a national or international basis after they have obtained tenure. Few professions are practiced as \"publicly\" as the profession of a University professor. Evaluation and review is therefore a continuing feature of the life of every professor.The Dynamics of Professorial Careers. The focus of a faculty member's professional activities may shift over time. The nationally recognized criteria for obtaining indefinite tenure place approximately equal emphasis on demonstrated excellence in teaching and research, and considerably less emphasis on service. As tenured faculty progress through their careers, however, some may redirect their energies. Some may, for example, devote proportionately more time to teaching, advising, administration, and University service than they did as assistant professors. Consequently, expectations for, and the goals of, individual faculty members may also change. For the purpose of post-tenure review, the fundamental criterion is demonstrated excellence in meeting the expectations and goals established jointly by the faculty member and his or her department or program. If, for example, it is in the department's and University's best interest to have a tenured faculty member focus more on teaching and service than upon research, post-tenure review for that faculty member should emphasize, acknowledge, and reward demonstrated excellence in those areas. A key aspect of this program is therefore the collaborative establishment of professional expectations for each faculty member under review.Collective Professional Responsibility for Faculty Development. In addition to their individual responsibilities, the faculty members in each unit (department, program, school, or college) of the University of Oregon have a collective responsibility to help individual colleagues achieve excellence. The purpose of this procedure is to promote a high level of dialogue among individual faculty members, their colleagues, and heads of units, so that each faculty member can draw upon the advice and resources of others in her or his pursuit of professional excellence.PROCEDURE1. The third-year substantive review. This review shall be conducted jointly by each individual faculty member and the appropriate dean, department, or program head. The faculty member shall submit by March 15th of the review year an updated vita and bibliography, and a summary statement of activities and accomplishments in the areas of research, teaching and service covering the previous three years.2. The sixth-year major review. The review should occur during the winter and spring terms. The faculty member to be reviewed will be notified of such by the appropriate dean, department, or program head no later than October 15th of the review year.a) The procedure for this review relates closely to the regular review process for faculty. In addition to the review for promotion and tenure by the Faculty Personnel Committee, yearly evaluation of faculty members is made by many department heads, deans, or other supervising officers. The sixth-year major review shall be conducted by an elected standing committee of the unit (department, program, school, or college) including three or more tenured faculty members of whom one may be outside the unit. The total number of members shall be determined by the unit. The committee shall include no department head or dean.b) Each school or college must have an elected, standing oversight committee. In the case of those schools or colleges which have formal departments, the sixth-year major review shall be conducted by an elected committee of the department. In the case of those schools or colleges that do not have formal departments, the sixth-year major review shall be conducted by the elected, standing oversight committee of that school or college, which may be an existing committee or one newly devised for that purpose. In the case of units so small that the creation an elected standing committee of the unit is impractical, the larger unit's oversight committee will make arrangements for the sixth-year major review.3. Scheduling. The sixth-year major review should occur during the sixth-year following the last promotion in rank, receipt of tenure, or the last sixth-year major review. The appropriate dean, department, or program head shall determine the schedule for years in which faculty members shall undergo third year and sixth-year reviews in accordance with the guidelines outlined in this document, noting the following:a) Associate Professors. The review will be timed so that the first third-year substantive review takes place in the third year after the awarding of tenure. Any review for promotion shall be substituted for the third-year substantive review or the sixth-year major review.b) Any faculty member within three years of retirement or on the 600-hour program may choose not to undergo review if that is the policy of the school or college.c) At the option of the faculty member, the department head, or the dean, an earlier review may be requested. The request for review, submitted in writing, shall include reasons for the earlier consideration. Copies shall be sent to the faculty member, the department head, and the dean. The time for review shall be determined by the review committee.d) A faculty member may request, in lieu of the sixth-year major review, a special review by the Faculty Personnel Committee be conducted through the regular review process.e) In practice, some deviations from normal scheduling may occur for a variety of reasons, including hiring, promotion, and sabbatical cycles.4. Statements and reports. a) The third-year substantive review. The dean, department, or program head reviews submitted materials then prepares a brief statement evaluating the performance of the faculty member and, for associate professors, commenting on the degree to which the faculty member is on target for promotion. This statement shall be given to the faculty member and signed by the faculty member to indicate that he or she has read it. The faculty member may submit a written response to the statement within thirty days. A copy of the statement and any response by the faculty member shall be filed in the faculty member's personnel file no later than June 15th of the review year.b) The sixth-year major review. The report of the elected standing committee is submitted to the department head who then reviews all relevant information and prepares a summary sixth-year major  report. These two reports shall be given to the faculty member and signed by the faculty member to indicate that he or she has read it. The faculty member may submit a written response to these reports within thirty days. A copy of these two reports and any response by the faculty member shall be filed in the faculty member's personnel file and a copy of these two reports and any response by the faulty member shall be forwarded to the appropriate dean no later than June 15th of the review year.5. Appeal process. Within the period specified in OAR 571-03-0000 et. seq. the faculty member may appeal to the University Faculty Grievance Appeal Committee after receipt of the statement or report described in 4a or 4b above.CRITERIA1. The following criteria (elaborated in the Faculty Handbook) will be used in post-tenure review:a) Maintenance of high quality of teaching.b) Continuing professional growth, scholarly activities, creative and artistic achievement.c) Exercise of leadership in academic and administrative service.d) Service and activities on behalf of the larger community.e) Additional criteria as may be established by individual departments.2. The information to be considered in decisions concerning post-tenure review will include the faculty member's statement of scholarly, scientific, professional or artistic accomplishments, goals, and plans; an up-to-date vitae and bibliography; accumulated annual faculty evaluation reports; the faculty member's responses, if any. Additional information including any of the following may be requested:a) A statement from the department head, dean or provost summarizing the past duties and responsibilities of the faculty member, including pertinent information concerning the conditions of appointment.b) Student evaluations and other materials relating to the quality of teaching or administration.c) In appropriate instances, letters of evaluation from individuals both on and off campus, with particular attention to evaluations by persons specially qualified to judge the contributions of the faculty member over the period of review.d) Supportive documents such as copies of publications, manuscripts, photographs of art objects, musical compositions, or reviews of performance.e) Other evaluation statements.USE OF REVIEWS1. The third-year substantive review. This review shall be an element of annual salary adjustment decisions.2. The sixth-year major review. A positive evaluation at the sixth-year major review of a faculty member holding the rank of Full Professor or Tenured Senior Instructor shall result in the recommendation to the Provost of an increase to the base salary of that faculty member comparable in amount and funding source to that given for promotion. Other faculty rewards should also be considered by the review committee for recommendation to the dean or department head.

Among these criteria there must be recognition of the value to the University in having minorities and women on its faculty. Their presence on the faculty will help University of Oregon students to develop as educated men and women who will make their contributions in our complex, racially and ethnically diverse society. The University also affirms the primary role of the faculty in selecting new faculty members.Procedures:\u00a01. In a search for a new faculty member at the point where a small list of finalists has been selected, the following consideration shall be taken into account and acted upon as appropriate. If there are minorities or women included on this list, then the best qualified of them shall be chosen, unless it is determined that some other candidate is demonstrably better qualified for the position or that no candidate is adequately qualified. The purpose of this procedure is to guard against the use of a closely divided departmental judgment, or one based on a genuinely small difference perceived among candidates, in order to choose a white man over a woman or minority applicant. While a department's final choice made on the basis of overall quality and value to the department is paramount, it is the University's policy to do everything possible to assure a maximum opportunity for consideration of minorities and women.2. When a proposed new appointee to a faculty position is a minority person or a woman, the person chairing the meeting considering the candidate should first seek to determine the views of the individual faculty members on the professional qualifications of the candidate, i.e., their best judgment of the candidate's substantive merit for the position. If it becomes apparent that a majority of the faculty group favor appointing the candidate, then even if a substantial number may be opposed to the candidate (and notwithstanding to the possibility that the group might be prepared to exclude the candidate from further consideration out of deference to the opinions of those opposed), the person chairing the meeting shall ask that no final negative decision be made until the matter has been discussed with the Dean of the school or College and with the Provost.Further, no communication to the candidate or to outside parties regarding the decision shall be made until these discussions have been completed. So that the successful completion of the hiring process will not be impeded, these consultation shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible.This review requirement does not suggest that the Dean or Provost will generally reverse the department's action, nor that their academic judgment will be substituted for that of the department. What it does mean is simply that the Dean and Provost will be cognizant of situations which, on the basis of careful examination, may be used both to bolster the University's affirmative action program and, at the same time, to bring excellent new faculty to the University.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a002\/07\/1986Issued by:\u00a0Presidential Memorandum to the FacultyDate:\u00a001\/22\/1986Revision History:\u00a001\/22\/1986\u00a0 Originally promulgated as a Presidential Memorandum to the Faculty02\/07\/1986\u00a0 Reviewed and Approval Recommended by President's Staff and Issued by the President02\/08\/2010\u00a0 Policy number revised from 3.140 to 02.01.15Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The report shall include the number of tax credit certificates issued, the amount of funds raised by the University, and the amounts transferred to the General Fund since its most recent prior report to the Board under this section.\u00a0(3) As requested by the Board from time to time but no less often than annually, the University shall submit a written report to the Board summarizing the grants made by the University under its Program and how they serve the goals of the Act and this policy.\u00a0G. Recoupment of Tax CreditsThe University shall monitor the use of Program grants and identify sources of Gross Royalty Income received by the University as the result of the use of the grants. \u00a0The University shall cause the transfer of 20 percent of such Gross Royalty Income to the General Fund but not to exceed the amount of the tax credit certificate issued by the University as a result of contributions to the Fund. This does not preclude transfers from other sources. Immediately upon deposit of the transferred amount into the General Fund, the University may issue new tax credit certificates in an amount not to exceed the transferred amount. The University shall maintain records of all transfers to the General Fund.\u00a0H. Reports to the Legislative AssemblyThe University shall report annually to the Legislative Assembly or, if the Legislative Assembly is not in session, to the interim legislative committees on revenue. The report shall be at the end of the fiscal year of the University or of its affiliated foundation and provide information for that fiscal year.

The University hereby establishes that these responsibilities include the provision by international students for health and accident care for themselves and dependent family members in the United States, including when the student is on a UO-approved study abroad program, vacation term, or medical leave term.(2) All international students enrolled part-time or full-time at the University of Oregon will be required to carry health and accident insurance for themselves and all their dependent family members who are in the United States. As such, all international students will be automatically enrolled in and billed for the UO Student Health Benefits Plan (UO SHBP) upon UO course registration. Students are responsible for paying all costs of enrollment in the UO SHBP, subject to late payment fees if payment deadlines are missed. The UO SHBP coverage may be waived if a student provides proof of adequate health insurance.(3) This policy will be carried out in accordance with associated procedures.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 4: Student health services\nRelated Resources:\u00a0International Student Plan (UO Health Center), including a summary, student guide, and information on benefits and coverage. {https:\/\/health.uoregon.edu\/international-student-plan}Procedures: http:\/\/health.uoregon.edu\/uo-international-student-health-insurance-requirement-procedureOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Kinds of Appointments(1) Appointments authorized in the University are: fixed-term appointments, tenure-related appointments (annual tenure and indefinite tenure) and extendible contract appointments as permitted by subsection (1)(c) of this Section A:(a) Fixed-term appointments:(A) Fixed-term appointments are appointments for a specified period of time, as set forth in the notice of appointment. The faculty member thus appointed is not on the tenure track and the timely notice provisions do not apply;(B) Fixed-term appointments may be made and are renewable at the discretion of the President;(C) Fixed-term appointments are designed for use at the discretion of the President in such cases as, but not limited to, appointments of visiting faculty (or similar category); academic staff members whose support wholly or principally comes from gift, grant or contract funds, the cessation of which funding would eliminate the budget base for the position in question; part-time faculty; administrative staff with faculty rank; and faculty appointments during an initial probationary period where an institutional policy has been adopted or negotiated that establishes such probationary period. Fixed-term appointments offered to visiting faculty or similar category shall not exceed a total of seven years;(D) University staffing plans shall define the characteristics, proper use and appropriate limits on use of visiting faculty or similar category.(b) Tenure-related appointments:(A) Annual tenure appointments are appointments given to faculty employed .50 FTE or more whom the University considers to be on the tenure track, in that, on completion of an appropriate probationary period, they will be evaluated and considered for appointment to indefinite tenure. If the initial annual tenure appointment or successive annual tenure appointments are to be terminated otherwise than for cause or for financial exigency, timely notice shall be given the faculty member;(B) Indefinite tenure appointments are appointments given selected faculty members having an appointment of .50 FTE or more. Such appointments are made by the President in witness of the University\u2019s formal decision that the faculty member has demonstrated such professional competence that the University will not henceforth terminate employment except for cause, financial exigency, or program or department reductions or eliminations.(2) \"Tenured\" faculty, as referred to in University policies, are faculty who have been awarded indefinite tenure.B. Eligibility for Indefinite Tenure(1) Indefinite tenure may be awarded to faculty employed on appointments of .50 FTE or more as senior instructor, assistant professor, associate professor or professor, if otherwise qualified in accordance with University criteria and the University\u2019s policies.(2) When indefinite tenure is awarded, there shall be a statement in the faculty member's personal file that the tenure appointment relates only to that FTE level specified in the notice of appointment for the year indefinite tenure is to become effective. For the indefinite tenure appointment to take effect, the statement concerning indefinite tenure must be signed by the faculty member and by the University officer authorized by the President to sign such statements. Alteration in the initial commitment may be by mutual consent of the faculty member and the University or by action provided for elsewhere in the University\u2019s policies.(3) Standards of performance and scholarly quality shall be the same for part-time and full-time faculty members.(4) Faculty members on a full-time tenure appointment may, by mutual agreement of the faculty member and the President or a designee, be given reduced appointments of less than 1.0 FTE under terms and conditions mutually agreed to in writing by the faculty member and the President or a designee.(5) Indefinite tenure shall be awarded to faculty of demonstrated professional competence by the President under terms and conditions set forth in applicable institutional rules and policies.(6) Tenure is reaffirmed as being institutional. Faculty having achieved tenure status in one Department institution cannot thereby claim tenure in other Department institutions. Probationary years of service in one Department institution may be counted toward probationary service requirements in another Department institution only with the latter's written approval.C. Initial Appointment and Probationary Service for Faculty on Tenure-Related Appointments(1) All faculty members on tenure-related appointments of .50 FTE or more, except as provided below, shall be appointed initially on one-year appointments.(2) Awarding of tenure to full-time faculty, except as provided below, shall involve assessment of the faculty member's performance each year during the probationary period, and assessment of performance over not less than five consecutive years (counting the year at the end of which tenure is granted). An additional probationary year may be required by the President, following that, if the faculty member is not awarded tenure, terminal notice shall be given, except as provided elsewhere in University policies.(3) The probationary period for regular part-time faculty employed .50 FTE or more in a tenure-related appointment shall be the same as for full-time faculty, except that it shall be calculated in terms of FTE years rather than calendar years.(4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the President may in special circumstances consider for tenure any probationary faculty member of the rank of assistant professor or higher, prior to completion of the normal probationary period, when, following a performance evaluation of the faculty member, a finding is made that such an early award of tenure would be to the advantage of the University. In no event will the first consideration for tenure occur later than in the fifth year.(5) Faculty members given an initial appointment at the rank of full professor may be granted tenure on appointment, at the discretion of the President. In unusual cases, and only when specifically approved by the President, associate professors may be given tenure on initial appointment.(6) At the time of initial appointment, a mutually acceptable written agreement shall be reached between the faculty member and the President or a designee, subject to delegation of authority under the University\u2019s policies, as to the extent to which prior experience of the faculty member shall be credited toward the probationary period required before the faculty member may be considered for tenure. The terms of the agreement shall be included in the notice of appointment.D. Consecutive Annual AppointmentsA series of annual appointments shall be considered consecutive whether or not interrupted by one or more official leaves of absence. An official leave of absence does not count as a year of service for purposes of tenure, nor does it prejudice the staff member's right to consideration for tenure for service actually rendered.E. Seventh Annual AppointmentsA full-time faculty member on annual tenure for a sixth consecutive year shall be awarded indefinite tenure commencing the seventh consecutive year or given notice of termination effective at the end of the seventh year.F. Appointment of Regular Part-Time Faculty Beyond the FTE Equivalent of the Sixth Consecutive YearA faculty member on a part-time annual tenure appointment of .50 FTE or more during each full academic year for a sufficient number of years to equal six or more years of full-time service may be reappointed under one of the following conditions:(1) With indefinite tenure at the FTE level specified in the notice of appointment for the year indefinite tenure is to become effective;(2) With notice of termination effective at the end of the next year.G. ExceptionsThe provisions of Sections B through E of this policy and Section B of UO Policy 580.021.0300-470 shall apply to all tenure-related appointments unless in individual cases there is a specific written agreement to the contrary between the University and the faculty member. The agreement to the contrary shall be incorporated or referred to in the notice of appointment.H. Criteria for Faculty Evaluation(1) Criteria for faculty evaluation, developed with the participation of appropriate faculty and University councils, shall be established within the University:(a) As a guide in evaluating faculty in connection with decisions on reappointment, promotion, and tenure;(b) As a basis for assessing those aspects of the faculty member's performance in which improvement is desirable, whether the faculty member is tenured or nontenured, with a view to stimulating and assisting the faculty member toward improvement through the resources available under the University\u2019s staff career support plan.(2) The criteria shall reflect the primary functions for which the University was established, namely:(a) Instruction;(b) Research accomplishments and other scholarly achievements, or where relevant, other creative and artistic achievement;(c) Professionally related public service, through which the University and its members render service to the public (i.e., individuals, agencies, or units of business, industry, government);(d) University service, including, but not limited to, contributions made toward departmental, school or institutional governance, service to students through student welfare activities such as individual student advising, advising with student organizations or groups and similar activities.(3) The criteria shall provide guidelines for sources and kinds of data that are appropriate as a basis for effective faculty evaluation at each administrative level (e.g., department, school, institution) and in each area (e.g., teaching, research, scholarly activity, service, etc.) where faculty evaluations are required. Specific provision shall be made for appropriate student input into the data accumulated as the basis for reappointment, promotion, and tenure decisions, and for post-tenure review. Sources of such input shall include, but need not be limited to, solicitation of student comments, student evaluations of instructors and opportunities for participation by students in personnel committee deliberations.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Participation as a candidate makes participation in the candidate review and evaluation process improper, however. Therefore, internal candidates must observe the following guidelines:1. Individuals who accept appointment to a search committee and participate in any of its deliberations may not enter that process later as a candidate. If, however, the search fails to find a suitable candidate, a member of the search committee may accept a temporary appointment to the position on an acting basis.If after an unsuccessful search, a second search, effort is commenced, a member of the first search committee may stand as a candidate, so long as he or she does not become a member of the second search committee.2. Internal candidates should not participate in the evaluation of other candidates. However, an internal candidate who is asked by another candidate to submit a recommendation may do so, but should disclose her or his own candidacy to the other candidate, and allow that person to withdraw the request. Any such references submitted should include notice of this disclosure and of the candidate's own status in the search.3. An internal candidate should not participate in any meeting, presentation, or other event at which another candidate is being evaluated. This is not to say that an internal candidate may not attend a meeting of his or her own discipline or profession if interviews will be conducted there. Rather, the candidate should not attend those sessions at which other candidates may be performing or being interviewed.4. When an internal candidate is officially informed that she or he will not be considered further as a candidate within the search process, she or he may begin to participate as a non-candidate within the search process.5. An internal candidate, who is asked to give any kind of evaluative comments for another candidate by a member of the search committee or by anyone else involved in the selection process, should decide on the grounds of his or her own candidacy.6. This policy should not be allowed to disenfranchise units from participating in the search process. Therefore, when a candidate, who because of his or her current position would have represented a unit in the evaluation process, is unable to take part, an alternate participant should be identified and asked to represent the unit.7. This policy is not intended to require changes in the traditional internal selection processes for department heads, program directors, or other internally determined leadership positions. Examples are if department heads are traditionally elected, or if the responsibility for certain administrative processes is rotated, or when the unit has some other process than one in which candidates \"apply,\" so long as these local processes have the ongoing approval of the members of that unit.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a008\/07\/1991Issued by:\u00a0President BrandRevision History:\u00a010\/04\/2016 Policy name updated for clarification (formerly: \"Faculty: Internal Candidates for Instructional and Administrative Academic Positions\")02\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.120 to 02.01.02Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In such cases:(a) An ad hoc committee will be convened by the Vice President to be composed of the Director of Affirmative Action, the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Committee, and one or more faculty representatives from the affected department;(b) The committee so convened shall consider whether the appointment furthers the University\u2019s affirmative action goals, and whether the individual considered is of the quality of the University of Oregon faculty;(c) After its consideration, the ad hoc committee will consult with and advise the appropriate Vice President with whom the final appointment decision rests.(3) An employee who has a grievance under this policy may invoke the University's grievance procedures including, if appropriate, referral to the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, as provided under OAR 571-003-0010.

OUS General Counsel reviewed and approved the policy on 7\/1\/2013.Policy:\u00a0That Oregon University System institutions* will:1. Help all students who borrow federal student loans to understand their rights and responsibilities regarding their student loan borrowing, debt, and repayment throughout the students\u2019 time at the institution;2. Develop and maintain an early warning system to identify and intervene with students who are most at-risk of incurring higher-than-average student loan debt, and provide a targeted strategy of education and outreach beyond federally mandated Entrance and Exit Counseling. This includes students in one or more of the following categories: considered \u201clow-income\u201d by definition of federal and State of Oregon financial aid criteria; studying in degree fields that typically make lower than average salaries (such as social work, arts); studying in degree fields with higher than average borrowing based on program cost (such as law, medicine, certain healthcare fields) and in which graduates may not earn salaries comparable with debt incurred; and students on academic probation who are at-risk of dropping out before earning a degree.3. Adopt and use the Federal Financial Aid Shopping Sheet or its successor document, by October 1, 2013, in order to provide clear, transparent information to student loan borrowers about gross and net costs and aid options at the institution, as well as the graduation rate, loan default rate, and median borrowing specific to that institution, and information on loan repayment choices; and provide easy web or other access to and information about net price calculators, and students\u2019 current and cumulative debt incurred to-date through available links to federal databases and other resources.4. Incorporate financial literacy into new student orientation programs, academic success classes, residence hall programming, and other similar orientation and outreach programs.5. Provide student loan borrowing and management information on institutions\u2019 respective web sites, providing guidance before, during, and after college on ways to manage and repay student loans.6. Track and report on an annual basis to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education data that demonstrates the types of debt counseling and management efforts taking place at the university and reports on indicators of progress and of reaching the most at-risk students with effective outreach efforts.* Includes Eastern Oregon University, Oregon Institute of Technology, Oregon State University, Portland State University, Southern Oregon University, University of Oregon, and Western Oregon University; and branch, satellite and other campus centers of these campuses.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0OUS Board Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The Museum endorses the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, and the 2003 American Association of Museums (AAM) recommended procedures regarding objects transferred in Europe during the Nazi Era, pursuant to an agreement reached in October 2000 by the AAM, the Association of Art Museum Directors and the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States;\u00a0(e) Title to objects shall be obtained free and clear of restrictions and qualifications of any type or manner, unless it is deemed by the University authorities (the President or the President's designees) in concurrence with the Museum Executive Director, the Museum Collections Committee, and the Curators to be in the best interests of the University. If an object is accepted under restricted conditions, notation of the restriction must be included in the object's permanent documentation.\u00a0(2) Criteria. Objects are added to the permanent collection by gift, purchase, bequest, exchange, or other transactions by which legal title passes to the Museum. Before accepting objects to the permanent collections, the Museum Collections Committee shall consider whether:\u00a0(a) The object to be accessioned is destined for a particular collection area. Objects not so destined shall be accepted only in rare circumstances, including but not limited to situations where it may be prudent and necessary to accept an entire private collection, even though some of the works may not be regarded as having Museum quality, in order to obtain desired works. The Museum Collections Committee shall make specific recommendations where entire collections are to be considered for acquisition;\u00a0(b) The object is unique or of greater aesthetic quality or value than similar ones already in the collections;\u00a0(c) Proper care can be given to the object;\u00a0(d) The object is in suitable condition for use and exhibition;\u00a0(e) The provenance of the object, as determined by the Director or appropriate Curator(s) is satisfactory;\u00a0(f) The object is encumbered with conditions imposed by the donor regarding use or future disposition. As a rule, only unrestricted objects should be accepted;\u00a0(g) The use of the object is restricted or encumbered by intellectual property rights (copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret) or by its nature (obscene, defamatory, potentially an invasion of privacy, physically hazardous);\u00a0(h) The object is generally consistent with the goals of the Museum.\u00a0(3) Appraisals and Donor Tax Deductions. Gifts to the Museum are tax deductible as a charitable donation based on the fair market value of the gift evidenced and substantiated in a manner acceptable under federal Internal Revenue Service regulations:\u00a0(a) Staff members of the Museum shall not provide appraisals for donated objects;\u00a0(b) Neither the Museum, the University of Oregon, nor the State of Oregon is responsible for the authenticity and accuracy of the appraisal.\u00a0(4) Museum Collections Committee. The Museum Collections Committee is an advisory committee to the Executive Director composed of members of the Museum\u2019s Leadership Council, University faculty, and others whose expertise in art and the art world is beneficial to the Museum, in addition to its permanent and ex officio members;\u00a0(a) The permanent, ex officio members of the committee are the Museum Executive Director, Curators, and Collections Manager;\u00a0(b) The other members of the committee are appointed for three-year terms by the President of the Museum\u2019s Leadership Council in consultation with and with the approval of the Museum Collections Committee chair, the Curators, and the Executive Director. The terms of office for these appointees shall be staggered to provide for committee continuity;\u00a0(c) The committee chairperson shall be selected by the President of the Museum\u2019s Leadership Council, and shall hold this position for a two-year term;\u00a0(d) If for any reason (other than the expiration of a member's term of office) an appointed position on the committee becomes vacant, the vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as original appointments. The replacement member shall serve for the unexpired portion of the vacating member's term.\u00a0(5) Meetings of the Collections Committee shall be called by the Chairperson of the Committee in consultation with the Executive Director two to four times annually, or more frequently, if so needed. The following procedures shall be followed:\u00a0(a) For each object under consideration for acquisition, the Director or Curator shall present to the Collections Committee the documentation and provenance of the object and explain its contribution to the collection as a whole;\u00a0(b) If possible, each object under consideration by the Executive Director should be physically present for evaluation by members of the committee. If the chairperson determines that this is not possible, adequate images of the object shall be presented to the committee;\u00a0(c) Minutes of all Collections Committee meetings shall be taken and maintained;\u00a0(d) The Collections Committee may suggest and recommend to the Executive Director for purchase work deemed desirable for the collection when funds are available.\u00a0(6) The Executive Director shall make all decisions with reference to acquisitions.\u00a0(7) The Executive Director shall notify donor(s) of acceptance or rejection of objects.\u00a0B. Museum De-Accessioning Procedure(1) Criteria. Permanent removal of objects from the collections will be done in a legal and ethical manner. The manner of disposition chosen will represent the best interests of the Museum, and the University of Oregon. An object in the Museum of Art collection can be considered for de-accessioning only if it meets at least one or more of the following criteria:\u00a0(a) It has physically or organically deteriorated beyond repair as determined by a reputable conservator; or\u00a0(b) It requires conservation, the cost of which would exceed the Museum's funds or the Museum's ability to raise the necessary monies; or\u00a0(c) It cannot be either properly stored or properly exhibited by the Museum; or\u00a0(d) It is, in the opinion of qualified outside experts, of markedly inferior quality and\/or there is a duplicate or superior example of the same kind and type already in the collection; or\u00a0(e) It no longer has study, research or exhibition value; or\u00a0(f) It no longer supports the mission of the Museum; or\u00a0(g) It is determined that the work is stolen or fake; or\u00a0(h) To comply with the November 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) or the 2003 AAM Guidelines Concerning the Unlawful Appropriation of Objects During the Nazi Era; or\u00a0(i) Object material is potentially hazardous to human health or to other objects.\u00a0(2) Procedure. Removal of object(s) from the Museum's permanent collections can be recommended only by the Executive Director, the Curator(s), the Collections Manager, or a conservator:\u00a0(a) After such a de-accession recommendation is made, a de-accession worksheet for each object shall be begun and placed in the documentation file;\u00a0(b) A thorough search shall be made by the Museum Collections Manager of records and related University archival files to determine legal ownership as well as restrictions imposed by the donor and accepted by the Museum at the time of accessioning. Where restrictions exist as to use or disposition of the object, the Museum will observe those conditions to the extent it is reasonably possible to do so. If there are questions as to intent or force of restrictions, the Museum will seek advice of the University Office of General Counsel. New acquisitions obtained through the sale or trade of the original donated item will be credited to the donor, as a \u201cGift of the donor by Exchange\u201d;\u00a0(c) The qualified staff members, including the Executive Director, Curator(s), and Collections Manager, will then meet to discuss the results of this search and to propose an appropriate course of action. If all agree to recommend de-accession, the recommendation and relevant information is then presented to the Museum\u2019s Collections Committee, which shall vote on recommending the de-accession to the Executive Director. A majority vote is sufficient for such recommendation. Final authority rests with the Executive Director to determine whether de-accession should occur. The Executive Director will then inform the Senior Vice President and Provost and the Vice President of University Relations of any decisions made regarding de-accessioning. The results of any de-accession vote shall be recorded in the documentation file;\u00a0(d) Before any object can be de-accessioned and exchanged or sold from the Museum collections (whether from \"permanent exhibition collections\" or \"study collections\"), one recognized professional expert (who is neither a current nor former Museum employee), recommended by the Museum staff, shall be consulted for an opinion on the quality of the object. If the reason for the recommendation is the poor condition of the work, the expert shall be a qualified conservator in the special area of the object under consideration and should additionally offer an opinion as to the physical and economical feasibility of reconditioning the work. This expert opinion shall be submitted in writing, dated, and kept in the permanent documentation file;\u00a0(3) Disposal. Upon approval to de-accession an object, the following procedures shall be implemented:\u00a0(a) The Museum Collections Manager shall notify the University Property Control Office and provide copies of supporting documentation to remove the object(s) from the Museum collection inventory;\u00a0(b) A written, dated appraisal from a certified art appraiser (who is neither a current nor a former Museum employee) shall be sought by the Collections Manager, Curators or Executive Director to establish current market value of the object(s) to be de-accessioned;\u00a0(c) In order that objects de-accessioned from the Museum collection may continue to serve the purpose for which they were initially acquired, an effort shall be made to place them (by exchange, transfer, or sale) in another non-profit institution. To achieve this end, such objects shall be advertised in appropriate professional publications, which may be online. Such advertisement shall clearly state that neither the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, the University of Oregon, nor the State of Oregon guarantees the authenticity nor the appraised value of the work. This disclaimer shall be repeated in writing at the time of sale, transfer, or exchange. Should it be deemed appropriate and useful for teaching, the de-accessioned work may be retained by the Museum for its study collection;\u00a0(d) Sales to private parties or profit-making entities shall be pursuant to state law dealing with disposition of surplus property. Whenever possible, the work of art should be sold at public auction in a city outside Eugene. In all cases, the sales should be public, although some works of art because of their nature may be more appropriately sold in the public marketplace. De-accessioned objects shall not be given or sold to any Museum staff member or University of Oregon official whose responsibility includes Museum operations, funding, or administration, nor to their representatives or immediate families. Members of the Museum\u2019s Leadership Council and its Collections Committee also may not acquire any de-accessioned item nor may their representatives or immediate families. Proceeds from sales are to be earmarked for the acquisition of objects that will improve the Museum's collection;\u00a0(e) Exchanges of de-accessioned objects shall be for object(s) of equal or greater value to the Museum and these transactions shall be made in accordance with the procedures of the Museum\u2019s De-accession procedures;\u00a0(f) Any transactions involving a combination of object(s) and monies (given or received) shall be negotiated at the discretion of the Executive Director after consultation with the Collections Committee;\u00a0(g) Copies of records for de-accessioned objects, including provenance, research, and data on publication, and a statement authorizing removal from the Museum collection (signed by the Executive Director and the appropriate University administrators) and any other necessary documentation will be forwarded to the acquiring institution (or individual) at the time of the exchange of ownership;\u00a0(h) Documentation shall be kept in donor files, showing disposition of object(s). Where feasible, the exhibition label on object(s) acquired through exchange of a donation, or with funds derived from the sale of a donation, shall credit the donor of the exchanged or sold gift. Original records for de-accessioned objects will remain on permanent file in the Museum Collections office, with the de-accession work sheet showing completion of all steps in the de-accession process, including record of means of disposal, new ownership, and the original document showing Museum and University approval of the de-accessioning and the Executive Director's authorization. Cross-references will be placed in catalog card files;\u00a0(i) The Museum Collections Manager shall initiate procedures to remove de-accessioned objects from the computer inventory records.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 8: Academics, other\nRelated Resources:\u00a0N\/AOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Policy renumbered from 07.00.03 to I.01.04.Reviewed; changed name of policy on November 3, 2010.\u00a0Policy number revised from 6.100 to 07.00.03 on February 8, 2010.Issued by the President on July 21, 1999.Policy:\u00a0It is the policy of the University of Oregon to regulate and control the use of the university's identifying marks including the university's name and seal and its various trademarks, collective membership, and service marks. The university permits the use of its trademarks on products or services only after the university and potential user, producer, manufacturer or service provider have entered into a trademark licensing agreement.The intent of this policy is to ensure that the university retains the ownership, benefit and control of its trademarks. The university's trademarks may be used only with the express approval and consent of the university through a trademark licensing agreement, and only under circumstances benefiting the university, its students and personnel, or its educational mission.All products or services that feature university trademarks must be produced by licensed vendors.Requirement of Licensing AgreementAny person, organization or entity manufacturing a product or providing a service bearing or containing university trademarks must, prior to use of the mark, enter into a trademark licensing agreement with the University of Oregon to obtain permission to use such mark.No use of any mark belonging to the university shall be authorized for use in products or services, either offered for sale or in promotional activities, without such an agreement.Each licensing agreement shall provide for a reasonable royalty to be paid to the university, or other consideration the university deems appropriate, in exchange for the university\u2019s permission to use its mark.University SalesNo university department shall offer for sale, use in promotional activities, or giveaway any product or service bearing or containing trademarks belonging to the university unless a trademark licensing agreement with the manufacturer for that product or provider of service is in effect.Any university department currently offering for sale, use in promotional activities, or giveaway of any product or service bearing or containing a mark belonging to the university shall not reorder such product or service, nor offer for sale any new products or services bearing or containing a university mark, until such a licensing agreement has been entered into with the manufacturer of the product or provider of the service, unless the department involved and the university\u2019s Office of Brand Management jointly determine that it is in the best interest of the university to temporarily waive the requirement of a licensing agreement.An item produced bearing a university trademark provided as a gift, sold as a fund-raiser, or used as a promotional tool, beyond the scope of an official university group (an academic or auxiliary service department) or university team (uniforms for the athletic department, club sports, or intramurals) is a commercial use. Products bearing university trademarks produced for use as giveaways to attendees of conferences, special events, booster activities, or for use as fund-raisers are commercial products. If an item bearing university trademarks is purchased by the university for internal use only by the university, and is not used as a giveaway or promotional item, the university\u2019s Office of Brand Management may waive the requirement that the manufacture of the product or provider of a service to enter into a commercial royalty bearing license agreement for the production of those items or services.AdministrationThe Office of Brand Management shall be responsible for the implementation and interpretation of this section and for negotiating the required trademark licensing agreements.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume I: Governance\nChapter 1: Governance and board affairs\nRelated Resources:\u00a0Brand Management and Trademark Licensing OfficeOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Instruction, research, and administration take priority. Consistent with applicable law and policy, when not required for university activities, and subject to other university policies, university Facilities may be scheduled for other uses.Both University Entities and Non-University Entities may schedule a UO Facility.Use of Facilities does not in any way imply that the university endorses, encourages, or approves the purposes, conduct, or messages of the users.The university may charge Non-University Entities an application fee for requesting to schedule the use of Facilities as described under Scheduling Responsibilities.Procedures (including schedule of fees) for scheduling of Facilities and conduct of events will be published on the UO website. This will include a timely appeal process for denied requests.Scheduling responsibilities:The University Registrar or designee is authorized to schedule Facilities for UO instruction.The UO Scheduling and Event Services is authorized to schedule, and facilitate planning and support, for non-academic use of scheduled university Facilities, not assigned to another administrator by this policy.The dean, director, or designee is authorized to schedule each Locally-Scheduled Facility in a manner consistent with this policy.All applicable scheduling fees must be approved by the Business Affairs Office and made publicly available on the UO website.Requests for scheduling of UO Facilities by Non-University Entities must be made in writing, using the required forms.

Any requester may be required to meet reasonable additional conditions necessitated by the requested use. All health, safety, fire, and other regulations must be observed by users of Facilities.The university reserves all concession and catering rights and the right to approve or disapprove the serving of alcoholic\u00a0beverages, as well as all rights to make audio or commercial video recordings or televise or broadcast any event.

Introduction(1) This section, in compliance with UO Policy 580.021.0005-55(P), describes the general operating procedures for this policy. This policy applies to all University of Oregon (University) faculty including officers of instruction and student employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements or other grievance procedures officially recognized by the University President:(a) Faculty employee grievance procedures are outlined in Sections (A)-(J), and (L);(c) Undergraduate and graduate student grievance procedures are outlined in the Student Handbook which appears in the University of Oregon Time Schedule.(2) Grievance procedures for classified employees and graduate teaching fellows who are covered by collective bargaining agreements are set forth in those agreements. Copies of the agreements are available in the Human Resources Office. Appeals from such procedures are governed by the contract, the rules of the Executive Department, the Employment Relations Board of the State of Oregon and state law.(3) Grievances and complaints by students (not arising under a collective bargaining agreement and not otherwise covered by undergraduate or graduate student grievance procedures) against faculty members arising out of their responsibilities as officers of the institution are within the jurisdiction of the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances and may be submitted to that body for investigation and consideration pursuant to Faculty Legislation of May, 1972. Upon the request of a student or of the University President, the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances shall exercise jurisdiction in such grievances or complaints whether or not the grievance arises in an employment relationship. The charge to the committee is included in Section (F).(4) No grievance procedures described herein shall preclude termination of any grievance proceeding prior to completion of all steps by reason of any mutually acceptable resolution between the parties set forth in writing for the record:(a) After a timely initial filing, time lines within the grievance procedures of this policy may be extended by a signed mutual consent statement;(b) A grievant shall not institute multiple grievances on the same subject under procedures within this policy;(c) The grievant shall describe a suggested resolution of the grievance.(5) University of Oregon employees not covered by the provisions of section A(1) of this policy, may invoke the grievance procedures described in Sections E-J:(a) Such grievances shall be initiated within 45 calendar days of the time the employee knows or by reasonable diligence should have known, of such act or omission, except:(A) In cases where the primary basis of the grievance is allegations of prohibited discrimination as defined by Section L(1)(c), the University will accept such grievance as timely if it is filed within 180 calendar days of the time the employee knows, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of the act or omission alleged to be discriminatory;(B) The University will accept a grievance alleging discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, as timely if it is filed within 365 calendar days of the time the employee knows, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of the act alleged to be discriminatory harassment.(b) The running of said 45 calendar days shall be suspended for any period during which the employee is not under appointment (including the period between the end of spring term or semester and the beginning of fall term or semester, and sabbatical, or similar periods of leave) at the University and shall resume the day the grievant's appointment recommences. In cases of sabbatical and similar periods of leave the grievance shall be initiated within 60 calendar days after the grievant's appointment recommences;(c) A grievant alleging prohibited discrimination shall have the longer of either 180 calendar days or the time permitted under subsection (b) of this section in which to make a timely filing of a formal grievance;(d) A grievant alleging discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, shall have the longer of either 365 calendar days or the time permitted under subsection (b) of this section in which to make a timely filing of a formal grievance.(6) During the period in which a grievance presented in a timely manner is in process, and while the employee is waiting for final disposition by the employer, administrative action shall not be taken to prejudice the position of the employee:(a) However, the implementation of any administrative action which is the subject of the grievance, including alteration or termination of programs, and reassignment, termination or non-renewal of an employee shall not be deemed a \"prejudicial act\" for the purposes of this section. If a grievance of the decision disclosed by the timely notice has been timely filed, it shall continue to be processed under these rules regardless of the fact that the grievant may no longer be employed;(b) Moreover, an individual filing a grievance in good faith or otherwise participating in any of the actions authorized under these grievance rules shall not be subject to reprimand or retaliatory action of any kind by any member of the University community for such filing and participation. If, however, it is determined that a grievant has filed a knowingly false grievance or has acted in bad faith, the grievant may be subject to disciplinary action or a counter-grievance.(7) If the grievant has filed an administrative claim (under ORS 30.160 et seq.) or has filed a claim with a state or federal anti-discrimination agency or has filed a lawsuit (or has intervened in an EEOC or Oregon Bureau of Labor Office of Civil Rights lawsuit) against the State of Oregon, the University of Oregon, or any of their respective officers or employees arising out of actions, omissions, decisions, events or policies which are the subject of a pending grievance or a grievance contemporaneously presented, the University may, in its sole discretion, decline to continue with or to entertain the grievance.(8) Unless a grievant has elected in writing a public hearing at Step Two filings, submissions, transcripts, testimony, reports, affidavits, and decisions\/responses shall not be available to the public and shall be treated as having been submitted or offered under a promise of confidentiality and\/or as personal information the disclosure of which would constitute unreasonable invasion of privacy.(9) During the course of a grievance, each party shall be responsible for costs of its own representation.(10) Effective July 1989, the President or the President's designee shall prepare an annual report to the Board of Trustees (Board) of the number, bases, and outcomes of all faculty grievances filed under this policy.\u00a0B. Faculty Grievance Procedure Definitions(1) \"Grievance\" means a complaint by an academic employee that the employee was wronged in connection with compensation, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment or the employee's rights were denied as to reappointment.(2) \"Other Conditions of Employment\" shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, violations of academic freedom, discriminatory employment practices and nondiscriminatory employment practices, and laws, rules, policies and procedures under which the University of Oregon operates.(3) \"Grievance Counselor\" means a person selected to act as grievance representative for a grievant. The Grievance Counselor may be an administrator, faculty member from an appropriate committee, or other person. The Grievance Counselor shall serve without charge.(4) \"Step\" means a level at which a grievance may be reviewed, negotiated, resolved, or denied. At the University of Oregon there are three steps in its formal grievance process. There can be one or more steps in its informal grievance process.(5) \"Provost\" means the Vice-President for Academic Affairs. When faculty serve within an administrative division headed by a Vice-President other than the Provost, then that Vice-President shall be involved in the grievance processes instead of the Provost.(6) \"Time Limit\" means that period of time during which certain processes of the grievance procedure must take place. The first day of a time limit is computed as commencing upon receipt and ending 24 hours thereafter.C. Faculty Grievance Process Digest(1) The following outline is provided to assist faculty in determining an appropriate course of action if they are considering whether or not to file a grievance and what type of process best addresses their need. The faculty grievance procedure, promulgated in response to UO Policy 580.021.0005.55(P), may be utilized to hear any complaint by a faculty member in connection with perceived wrongs in compensation, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment, or that a faculty member's rights were denied as to reappointment. \"Other conditions of employment\" shall include, but not be limited to, violations of academic freedom, discriminatory employment practices and nondiscriminatory employment practices, and laws, rules, policies and procedures under which the University operates. Disciplinary sanctions are imposed in accordance with UO Policy 580.021.0300-470(F) and shall not be subject to grievance procedures within this policy.(2) Informal Grievance Process: Faculty are encouraged to bring complaints to the attention of the University administration at any time so that they may be resolved informally. However, if a faculty member wishes to preserve the right to file a formal grievance under this policy, informal resolution processes must be filed within the time limits set forth in Section A(5).(3) Except in cases of alleged discrimination, a response to an informal complaint is due in 15 calendar days. Responses to informal complaints alleging discrimination are due within 30 days. See Section D for complete details:(a) May be handled orally or in writing;(b) Mediative procedures are those in which the identities of the parties are disclosed;(c) Educative procedures are those in which the identities of the parties are not disclosed;(d) Promotion and tenure grievances are to be handled as provided in Section H.(4) Formal Grievance Process: Must be filed in writing within the time limits set forth in Section A(5):NOTE: Promotion and\/or tenure grievances begin at Step Two. See Sections E and H for complete details.(a) Step One: File detailed written statement of grievance including suggested resolution with immediate supervisor of the person(s) causing grievance; or(b) Request appropriate Vice-President to appoint a grievance counselor and after consultation with counselor, file grievance;(c) When the grievance is based on promotion, tenure, or retention and the grievant has elected the formal process, the Provost (or appropriate Vice-President) shall start the grievance process at Step Two. All other types of formal grievances start at Step One;(d) Step One response is due in writing 20 calendar days from receipt by respondent, except in cases alleging prohibited discrimination in which case the response is due within 30 days of the filing of the complaint;(e) If Step One response is unsatisfactory or is not received within time limit, grievant wishing to do so may file written grievance at Step Two;(f) Step Two: Filing at Step Two must be completed within 15 calendar days of the end of Step One. Step Two offers three options: Hearing by either of two faculty committees, or review by the appropriate administrator:(A) The committee option permits the grievant to file with either the Grievance Appeal Committee, or Promotion\/Tenure\/ Retention Appeal Committee, depending on subject matter; the committee acts within a 60 calendar day period, giving all parties at least ten calendar days\u2019 notice of hearing and access to all documentary evidence received not later than five calendar days before the hearing;(B) The grievant may elect to have the Step Two investigation and decision made by the appropriate Vice-President (i.e., the one under whom the grievant serves) instead of having a hearing before either of the two faculty committees.(g) If Step Two response is unsatisfactory or is not received within the stated time limit, grievant wishing to do so may file written grievance at Step Three;(h) Step Three: Filing at Step Three must be completed within 20 calendar days of the end of Step Two. The written grievance shall be filed with the President of the University;(i) The President (or the President's designee) shall decide the grievance and shall prepare findings of fact and conclusions based on those findings within 20 calendar days of receipt of the grievance, and shall render the final decision to the grievant in writing;(j) Step Three ends the University appeal process. Decisions of the President are appealable only to the Board. (See UO Policy 580.021.0005-55(P) and\/or (Q).)D. Faculty Informal Grievance Procedure(1) The University administration encourages faculty whenever possible to use the informal approach to resolving complaints and grievances. However, the decision of whether or not to use informal procedures is solely that of the grievant. There is no requirement that informal procedures be attempted or exhausted as a prerequisite to invocation of formal procedures nor is there any need to elect between informal or formal procedures other than the need to timely file the formal procedure. If the grievant intends to pursue informal procedures the informal mode best suited to the nature of the complaint should be selected. Responsibility for initiating grievance resolution shall be with the grievant.(2) If the grievant wishes to invoke the formal process, the grievant must do so within the time limits set forth in Section A(5), regardless of whether informal resolution is attempted or achieved. The days used in the informal process shall count in the computation of the applicable time limit within which formal grievances shall be filed. The appropriate Vice-President may waive the timely filing requirement at the request of the grievant if the grievant is currently pursuing resolution under this informal procedure and it appears that additional time (without a concurrent formal proceeding) would be beneficial. Such waiver shall be in writing and must issue before the applicable time limit has run.(3) Generally, informal grievances are handled through discussion. Although not required:(a) Brief, dated and signed statements may be prepared by the parties to facilitate discussion;(b) A dated, written statement of resolution may be signed by the parties;(c) Separate, dated, written statements summarizing the unreconciled differences, respondent's position and\/or unaccepted counter proposal may be signed for entry into the record of the formal grievance procedure.(4) Possible informal approaches include:(a) The grievant meets privately with the person(s) alleged to have caused the grievance. Through discussion, the parties to the matter attempt to reconcile differences and to reach a reasonable resolution; or(b) Grievant requests an administrator in the same administrative area, if possible the one to whom the grievant and the individual complained about both report, to consider the complaint and to attempt to effect a mutually satisfactory resolution; or(c) Grievant, through the appropriate Vice-President, shall request to have a member of the Grievance Appeal Committee, of the grievant's choice, consider the complaint and attempt to effect a mutually satisfactory resolution; or(d) When the matter is related to prohibited discrimination, including sexual harassment, the grievant may request the Office of Affirmative Action to initiate informal mediation (identity disclosed) or education (identity concealed) efforts. A University employee receiving an informal complaint alleging prohibited discrimination including sexual harassment shall report that fact to the Office of Affirmative Action and follow the applicable procedures described in Section L(5);(e) The grievant may present the complaint to the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances (see Sections A(3) and F). Except as waived by a Vice-President (see section D(2)) the time consumed by this committee's handling of the grievance shall not suspend the running of the applicable time limitations for filing a formal grievance;(f) For grievances concerning promotion and\/or tenure decision, the only possible informal procedures are specified in Section H of this policy and, for grieved decisions denying promotion or tenure but not resulting in terminal notice, the informal review shall parallel the procedures described in Section H.(5) If informal resolution involving a Grievance Appeal Committee member is unsuccessful and if a formal grievance is filed, unless the grievant and the grieved-against individual both request to the contrary, the member of the Grievance Appeal Committee who participated in the informal grievance process shall not participate as a member of the Grievance Appeal Committee at Step Two.(6) Informal grievances shall receive a response within 15 calendar days of submission, except those grievances which allege prohibited discrimination including sexual harassment which shall receive a response within 30 days. With regard to the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances, \"submission\" shall mean the time at which the parties have presented their respective cases to the committee.(7) In cases of informal challenges to promotion and tenure decisions under Sections E or I of this policy, the grievant may apply in writing to the appropriate Vice-President for the appointment of a Grievance Counselor to represent the grievant at no charge. The grievant may provide the Vice-President with a list of three possible Grievance Counselors or may ask the Vice-President to suggest a list of three from which the grievant may select one. In general the Grievance Counselor shall provide aid and assistance to the grievant. This shall include but is not limited to, providing information about the various steps in the grievance procedure, representing the grievant before appropriate committees or administrators, enlisting the aid of the Affirmative Action Office if appropriate, or other aid.\u00a0E. Faculty Formal Grievance Procedure(1) Step One: The grievant shall present the individual(s) against whom the grievance is filed and the immediate supervisor of the person grieved against with a written statement describing as precisely as possible what the grievance is about, including who or what caused the situation, what happened, and if applicable, where, why, when, and how the situation occurred and identifying any rule, policy, or procedure alleged to have been violated or misapplied. A list of witnesses, if applicable, shall be provided. A suggested resolution shall be described. The grievance statement shall be signed and dated and it shall include the grievant's campus address and campus and home telephone numbers. If the informal process has been used, a brief description of it shall be provided along with any documentary exhibits that may have been developed. A copy of the grievance statement shall be sent contemporaneously by the grievant to the President's Office. If the grievance involves illegal discrimination, a copy shall also be sent by the grievant to the Office of Affirmative Action. Grievants seeking to grieve promotion and\/or tenure decisions formally begin at Step Two, after consultation with the Provost (or appropriate Vice-President). Time lines and details are specified in Section H:(a) The grievant may apply in writing to the appropriate Vice-President for the appointment of a Grievance Counselor to represent the grievant at no charge. The grievant may provide the Vice-President with a list of three possible Grievance Counselors or may ask the Vice-President to suggest a list of three from which the grievant may select one. In general the Grievance Counselor shall provide aid and assistance to the grievant. This shall include, but is not limited to, providing information about the various steps in the grievance procedure, representing the grievant before appropriate committees or administrators, enlisting the aid of the Affirmative Action Office if appropriate, or other aid. The Grievance Counselor shall not act as arbitrator of the grievance while acting on behalf of the grievant;(b) The Step One decision-maker shall require a written memorandum from the grieved-against individual to offer that person's position on the matter;(c) The immediate supervisor of the person grieved-against to whom the grievance is directed shall send a written response to the grievant and the grieved-against individual no later than 20 calendar days from the day the grievance is received, except in cases of alleged discrimination, including sexual harassment, in which case the written response is due no later than 30 days from receiving the grievance. In cases of alleged discrimination, including sexual harassment, the Step One decision-maker shall contact the Office of Affirmative Action and utilize the services of that office as appropriate to investigate the complaint. The response shall either resolve the grievance to the satisfaction of the grievant, or provide such relief as appears appropriate following examination of relevant facts, or shall state why the grievance is not deemed to be valid or why the relief requested in the grievance is not appropriate.(2) Step Two:(a) If the grievance is not resolved at Step One to the satisfaction of the grievant or if the respondent at Step One fails to respond in timely fashion, the grievant may appeal by filing the written grievance and all relevant documents and materials developed during Step One with one of the following committees as appropriate within 15 calendar days after the end of Step One:(A) Grievance Appeal Committee for all grievances not within the jurisdiction of the Pro-motion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee; or the(B) Promotion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee which shall consider only formal grievances concerning denial of promotion or denial of tenure (or denial of both) or failure to renew an appointment in violation of the UO Policy 571.003 grievant's rights.(b) The appropriate committee shall entertain appeals directed to it within the following constraints:(A) The statement of appeal shall be in writing (see Section E(1) of this policy for details) and shall include the response at Step One and any arguments the grievant wishes to make about the Step One response;(B) All documentary evidence received shall be identified, marked, and indexed in the record;(C) The grievant and the University and\/or complained-against person(s) shall have full access to the record (as it exists at any given time) and to tape recordings of the testimony received;(D) Live testimony shall be taken at a duly-noticed hearing. Clarifying questioning is to be by the committee only;(E) The grievant shall be given the maximum possible (but in no case less than ten calendar days) advance notice of the initial hearing date, place, and time;(F) The grievant and the University and\/or the complained-against person(s) shall be allowed to present documentary evidence (including affidavits or signed declarations), demonstrative evidence and\/or live testimony;(G) The committee shall inform the grievant and the grieved-against individual no less than five calendar days in advance of any hearing of all documentary evidence received by it at the time of said notice. Such evidence shall be identified by reference to source, date, and, generally, content. The grievant and the grieved-against individual shall also be told how to acquire copies of such evidence before the hearing;(H) The grievant shall have the right of the assistance of a University-appointed Grievance Counselor, the grieved-against individual(s) shall have the right of the assistance of a University-appointed Grievance Counselor or the grievant, University and\/or complained-against person(s) shall have the right to an advocate (attorney or otherwise) at their respective expense;(I) The grievant and the University and\/or the complained-against person(s) shall be allowed to make introductory statements, to argue and summarize the presentation at a conclusion of receiving evidence, and shall be afforded an opportunity to rebut or explain new evidence or testimony; written presentations are to be encouraged over oral presentations; and if a party wishes an attorney to be involved, the attorney is permitted to develop written submissions;(J) Live testimony shall be tape-recorded. There shall be no obligation on the committee to transcribe the tape, but copies of the tape shall be made available to any party to the grievance at the cost of reproduction and a pro rata share (among those requesting copies) of transcription;(K) Hearings shall be open to the public (to the extent allowed by law) at the option of the grievant; however, the deliberations of the Committee shall be closed to all, including the grievant and the grieved-against individual(s);(L) The Committee shall make its conclusions and recommendation solely upon evidence received in the record and shall, where practicable, cite specific evidence to support its resolution of disputed issues of fact;(M) The committee shall formulate its conclusions and recommendations within 60 calendar days of receipt of the appeal;(N) The proceedings of the committee (or any other step of this grievance procedure) shall not be deemed the handling of a contested case. If a grievant is otherwise entitled to a contested case proceeding, but wishes to have the grievance handled under Section E(2)(b) of this policy, the grievant shall waive in writing the use of contested case procedures. If a grievant is otherwise entitled to a contested-case proceeding, and does not file such a waiver, the provisions of OAR Chapter 571, Division 2 shall govern to the extent applicable. [Note: Chapter 571, Division 2 was repealed on December 11, 2014.](c) No grievance shall be denied at Step Two under Section E(2) of this policy without prior consultation between the chair of the committee to whom the grievance is directed and the Vice-President of the Division.(3) In lieu of an appeal to the committees specified in paragraphs E(2)(a)(A) and (B) of this policy, the grievant may appeal by filing the written grievance and all relevant documents and materials developed during Step One with the appropriate Vice-President for Step Two consideration:(a) The Vice-President may use staff for investigatory support and shall have the authority to request information and testimony beyond that presented by the grievant or by the disposition at Step One. The Vice-President shall render a decision in writing and shall base the resolution upon relevant, undisputed facts and upon such relevant disputed facts as are determined. Sources of data or evidence or documents relied upon shall be identified;(b) The Vice-President's decision shall be rendered within 30 calendar days of receipt of the grievance. Copies shall be sent promptly to the grievant and the grieved-against individual.(4) If the grievant or the grieved-against person is not satisfied with the resolution recommended by the committee under subsection E(2)(a) or (b) of this policy or with the decision reached by the Vice-President under section E(3) of this policy, the appellant may appeal to the University President within ten calendar days after receipt of the Step Two disposition.(5) Step Three: The President (or the President's designee) shall review the recommendation of the Committee or the decision of the Vice-President:(a) The President shall be free to seek additional or clarifying evidence. However, to the extent the President obtains such further evidence and deems such evidence to be meaningful and likely to influence the presidential decision, the President (or designee) shall notify the grievant and the grieved-against party of the receipt of such evidence and shall afford such persons access to the evidence and an opportunity to respond if they desire (with contemporaneous copies to all parties). In cases involving alleged prohibited discrimination, the President shall consult with the Director of the Office of Affirmative Action;(b) The President (or designee) shall issue a written decision which shall include findings of fact. If the President's (or designee's) decision modifies or rejects the Step Two action, the areas of modification or rejection shall be identified and the reasons for such changes shall be stated in the decision;(c) The decision shall be rendered within 20 calendar days of the receipt of the Step Three appeal and shall be sent to the grievant and Policy 571.003 grieved-against party upon issuance.(6) There shall be no further appeal within the University from the President's decision. Decisions of the President are appealable within the Board of Trustees only pursuant to the provisions of University policy.(7) If a response is not made within the prescribed time, the decision at the previous step (or status quo if it is the Step One response which is overdue) shall be deemed affirmed for the purposes of giving the grievant the option of appealing to the next higher step.(8) Failure to appeal the grievance in timely fashion shall be deemed as acceptance of the result at the previous step, i.e., if the grievant does not appeal the Step One decision, it shall stand resolved and if neither party appeals the Step Two decision, it shall stand resolved.(9) The grievant and administrator or committee responsible for rendering the decision in any given step may agree in writing to an extension of either the appeal or the response time. Such extensions shall not apply to or in any way suspend the running of any state or federal limitations or charge-filing periods (these are mandatory time lines) for grievances alleging illegal discrimination.(10) In the event that it shall prove impossible to convene a Faculty Grievance Committee during summer term, the grievant and administrator or committee involved shall mutually agree to extend the response time into the following fall term.F. Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances(1) The Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances shall be composed of an equal number of students and faculty appointed by the President. It shall make itself readily accessible to all members of the University community, and shall determine in each case whether a particular grievance falls within its jurisdiction (in cases where the Committee determines it has no jurisdiction, it may choose to recommend an alternate procedure consistent with other sections within Policy 571.003):(a) The charge to the Committee shall be to receive complaints or grievances against faculty, either officers of instruction or officers of administration, arising out of their responsibilities as officers of the institution; and(b) To investigate and review these complaints or grievances on an informal manner, affording full opportunity to the concerned parties to be heard; and(c) To attempt to resolve differences or adjust grievances in an amicable fashion consistent with the understanding of the parties and the best interests of the University; and(d) To issue such findings and recommendations (furnishing copies to the persons concerned) to either the President (if the grievance was initiated by a faculty member) or the appropriate Vice-President (if the grievance was initiated by a student) as appear appropriate under the circumstances;(e) Referral to the Committee shall not suspend any applicable grievance time lines.(2) By filing a complaint under any grievance rule and bringing it before this Committee, an aggrieved person authorizes the Committee to inquire into the matter as necessary to discover the applicable facts and to communicate as specified in this rule, its findings, recommendations and reasons to the concerned parties.(3) Grievances Filed by Faculty: Faculty, officers of instruction or officers of administration, may present grievances to the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances:(a) Consideration by the Committee is an informal process only for addressing faculty complaints or grievances;(b) The President is in no way obliged to act on the Committee's recommendations or to be further involved;(c) The Committee shall render its grievance recommendation in writing within 15 calendar days of consideration of the complaint or grievance. \"Consideration\" shall mean the time at which the parties have presented their respective cases to the Committee.(4) Grievances Filed by Students: Under the formal student grievance process at Step Two described in Section P(3)(a), students with grievances against faculty arising out of their responsibilities as officers of the institution may present grievances to the Student Faculty Committee on Grievances:(a) Referral to the Committee shall be consistent with grievance time lines stated in Section O(2) in the case of student originated grievances. The Committee shall render its recommendations in writing within 15 calendar days of its consideration of the grievance. \"Consideration\" shall mean the time at which the parties have presented their respective cases to the Committee. The Committee shall make good faith efforts to complete its review within 30 days of a party's presenting a grievance to it;(b) The Committee shall present its report to the parties to the grievance and to the appropriate Vice-President. The report shall include the Committee's findings of fact, a recitation of applicable policy and its recommendations for action. If the parties and the Vice President accept the committee's recommendation, it shall be implemented and the grievance shall be considered resolved;(c) The Vice President may accept or reject the Committee's recommendation or may request further investigation and reconsideration by the Committee;(d) Any party to the grievance may accept or reject the Committee's recommendation or the Vice President's action by appealing to Step Three of the student grievance process (Section P(4) et seq.).G. Composition of Faculty Grievance Appeal Committees(1) The faculty grievance procedure described in Section E calls for two elected faculty grievance committees to be available to consider appeals at Step Two. These committees have been established by Faculty Legislation.(2) The Grievance Appeal Committee shall hear, on request of the faculty member grieving at Step Two, all grievances excepting those concerning denial of promotion, denial of tenure (or denial of both), or failure to renew an appointment in violation of the grievant's rights:(a) The committee shall have its five members elected by the non-students eligible to vote at meetings of the University Assembly;(b) Committee members shall be unclassified academic employees with faculty rank. The Committee on Committees shall insure a slate of at least two candidates each year for each open position. Candidates may also be nominated by petition which must be signed by at least ten valid signatures of voting faculty. Petitions shall be distributed by the Secretary of the Faculty. Ballots shall contain candidates nominated by the Committee on Committees and those nominated by petition;(c) Members of the Grievance Appeal Committee may not serve successive terms;(d) At the time of the first election, by lot one member shall be elected for a one-year term, two for a two-year term, and two for a three-year term. Thereafter, as terms expire, new members shall be elected to three-year terms;(e) In conducting its business, the Grievance Appeal Committee shall follow the rules of procedure as set forth in Sections E(2), (7), (8), and (9). The committee shall elect its own chair annually.(3) The Promotion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee shall hear, at the request of the grieving faculty member at Step Two, all grievances concerning denial of promotion or denial of tenure (or denial of both), or failure to renew an appointment in violation of the grievant's rights:(a) The committee shall have its three members, all of whom must be tenured, elected by the non-students eligible to vote at meetings of the University Assembly. Current Deans and Department Heads shall not be eligible to serve. The committee shall consist of one representative from the College of Arts and Sciences, one from the professional schools and one at large. Nominees, none of whom may be from the same department, shall be persons who previously have been elected to serve (and have served) on the Faculty Personnel Committee, with the following exceptions;(b) No one may serve simultaneously on the Faculty Personnel Committee and the Promotion\/ Tenure\/Retention Appeals Committee;(c) Any member who served on the Faculty Personnel Committee or the College Personnel Committee, or who participated in the depart-mental vote when the grieved action or decision (or informal reviews thereof) occurred must be excused from hearing such an appeal but shall otherwise continue to serve on this committee;(d) Members of the committee may not serve successive terms;(e) If any one (or more) member(s) is disqualified under subsection (c) of this section, the fourth and subsequent candidate(s) in the election for the committee shall be asked to serve in place of the disqualified member(s);(f) The Committee on Committees shall insure a slate of at least two candidates for each open position each year. The candidates shall otherwise be qualified and shall be chosen to insure the division of membership specified in section G(1) of this policy;(g) Candidates may also be nominated by petition. A petition with ten valid signatures of voting faculty shall place those candidates nominated by the petition on the ballot. Petitions shall be distributed by the Secretary of the Faculty and shall specify whether they are for candidates to represent the College of Arts and Sciences or the Professional Schools and Colleges or the at-large position;(h) Separate ballots shall be prepared for the candidates from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Professional Schools and Colleges. The ballots shall list the candidates nominated by the Committee on Committees and those nominated by petition. All ballots shall be circulated to all voting faculty members;(i) All members shall be elected to serve staggered three-year terms. At the time of the first election, the person receiving the third highest number of votes shall fill the at large position. The one-, two- and three-year terms of service shall be made by lot. Thereafter, one person shall be elected each year for a three-year term as determined by the original lot, except for those elected to fill vacancies of unexpired terms;(j) In conducting its business, the committee shall follow the rules of procedure as set out in Sections E(2), (7), (8), and (9) and Sections H(2)(b) through (e);(k) The Committee shall elect its own chair annually;(l) The grievant may make a peremptory challenge of one member of the Committee. That member shall be replaced by one selected to serve pro tem by the grievant from a list proposed by the Faculty Advisory Council of three tenured candidates (except that for grievants who are officers of administration non-tenured faculty may be listed).H. Appeal of Failure to Grant Promotion or Tenure When Such Decision Results in Terminal Notice(1) Appeal of the decision to deny promotion or tenure which results in terminal notice shall be directed by the appellant in writing to the Provost within 90 days of actual receipt of terminal notice. If the candidate is outside of the United States at the date of receipt, the period for filing an appeal shall be extended to 60 days after the candidate first thereafter returns to the State of Oregon. Under University policy, grievants\/appellants are entitled to have their complaints considered either informally or formally, but not both. The Provost or appropriate Vice-President shall refer the appeal to the Faculty Personnel Committee or to the appropriate College or School promotion and tenure committee (informal procedure) unless the candidate and the Vice-President agree that it would more appropriately be referred to the Promotion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee (formal procedure) for its recommendation. In making decisions under this policy, the Vice-President shall exercise authority hereby delegated from the President.(2) Appeals made under subsection H(1) of this policy and referred by the Provost to the Faculty Personnel Committee or the College or School Promotion and Tenure Committee shall constitute the institution's informal procedures and be considered in the following manner:(a) The review will take the form of a reconsideration by a panel (with a minimum of three members) of the Faculty Personnel Committee. Reconsideration shall be conducted for the Faculty Personnel Committee by a panel of the Committee or the college or school committee which does not include members who served during the year in which the case was previously reviewed. The informal process is advisory to the Provost and the results of the reconsideration will be presented as recommendations to the Provost;(b) The purpose of the reconsideration shall be to make an evaluation of the fairness and reliability of the decision-making process. This reconsideration involves:(A) Determination of whether errors of fact existed;(B) Determination of whether relevant evidence was unavailable, disregarded or overlooked; and(C) Determination of whether the decision was in any way arbitrary or capricious or whether it had a significant foundation in fact on which to justify the original evaluative judgments and recommendations.(c) Should the panel of the Faculty Personnel Committee conclude that prejudicially erroneous facts were utilized or that relevant evidence capable of reversing the appraisal was rejected, overlooked, or previously unavailable, or that the original judgment was arbitrary and capricious, or prohibited by law, or that the decision was otherwise unwarranted for lack of any significant factual foundation, it shall so advise the Provost, Dean, and Department Head to reconsider the original recommendations with respect to the case;(d) The appellant can review that part of the appellant's file which is open and will receive a substantive abstract of any closed part of the file. A proper abstract of the file is interpreted to mean document-by-document, not a general summary, with the condition that editing and abstracting will maintain the confidentiality of sources who submitted their evaluations with assurance of confidentiality in accordance with any earlier waiver of the appellant's right to have the University use no confidential sources. The abstract shall be prepared by an officer from the Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs and Provost and a member of the Faculty Personnel Committee;(e) Reconsideration by the Promotion\/Tenure\/ Retention Appeal Committee is a formal grievance procedure which begins at Step Two and proceeds under Section E(2)(a). Neither method of review nor the underlying grievance is defined as a contested case under ORS 183.310(2) or UO Policy 580.021.0300-470(T). Prior to the reconsideration, the appellant shall be given appropriate notice that if the appellant so chooses, the appellant has the opportunity to introduce information which is new or hitherto unavailable or overlooked by the Faculty Personnel Committee, to review the open portion of the file and the abstracts and summaries and to make a personal presentation on the grounds set forth in subsection (2)(b) of this section of the Policy. There is no requirement or expectation of formal public hearings with counsel in the informal reconsideration.(3) When appeals made under subsection (1) of this section are referred to the Promotion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee, the same standards and procedures as are outlined in section H(2)(b) through (e) of this policy shall be followed in addition to the procedures specified in Section E(2)(b). Either type of committee referred to in this section shall exclude faculty members who served on the Faculty (or College) Personnel Committee in the year in which the case was reviewed by that Committee.(4) An appeal of a Promotion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee decision may be made to the President. An appeal to the President shall be directed by the appellant in writing to the President within ten calendar days of the receipt of Promotion\/Tenure\/Retention Appeal Committee's decision. The President shall notify the appellant of the President's final decision within 20 calendar days of the receipt of the appellant's written appeal. There shall be no further appeal within the institution of the President's decision.I. Appeal of Non-Terminal Denial of Promotion or Tenure(1) This section I applies to appeals concerning denial of promotion or tenure where such decision does not result in terminal notice.(2) Decisions respecting academic or professional performance of officers of instruction are based on the evaluative judgment of peers. These judgments are entrusted to the academic peer group. Denial of promotion or tenure may be challenged informally or formally (but not both), under the procedure and standards provided in Section H. Because the grievant in such situations has not received a terminal notice, the question of whether the grievant deserves promotion and tenure will be decided in the following academic year by the Faculty Personnel Committee if the candidate requests that the case be resubmitted. Requests for such consideration shall be made in writing addressed to the Provost. Upon such reconsideration, the file may be augmented by all parties involved. Such further consideration will lead to a recommendation to the Provost for further action.(3) Appeals concerning denial of promotion for officers of administration which do not result in terminal notice may be challenged informally or formally (but not both) under the procedure and standards provided in Sections H(2)(b) through (d) by filing a written appeal with the appropriate Vice-President.J. Non-Renewal of a Fixed-Term or Annual AppointmentNon-renewal of a fixed-term or annual appointment of an officer of instruction in other than a promotion and tenure case (e.g., other than terminal notice during the seventh year) will be grievable only to the extent that a property right in such a reappointment has been violated or if prohibited discrimination is alleged to have been a factor in non-reappointment. In such cases, the procedures of Section E shall govern.L. Prohibited Discrimination, Discriminatory Harassment, and Sexual HarassmentUsing arbitrary or capricious grounds to make available or to deny educational or professional opportunity to other members of the University community is unprofessional conduct and may constitute prohibited discrimination under the University's policies. Prohibited discrimination including discriminatory harassment and sexual harassment of students, faculty, or staff by other members of the University community is prohibited both by law and this policy. Unwelcome sexual activity by persons abusing positions of economic, supervisory, or academic power is inherently oppressive. Discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, regardless of the relative power of the harasser, is disruptive of the workplace and campus life, and it acts to deny its object equal opportunity as a student or an employee. Discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, shall not be tolerated at the University of Oregon:(1) Definitions:(a) Members of the University community are defined as students, faculty, and staff except for purposes of grievances alleging disability discrimination against the grievant where the definition of \"University community\" is broadened to include members of the public applying for admission as students, attending or participating (or desirous of attending or participating) in programs on University owned or leased property, applying for employment, or otherwise having business to transact in University facilities (this broadened definition does not apply to the second sentence of the introductory paragraph of this section);(b) For purposes of timeliness, \"filed\" means a signed grievance delivered to a University official authorized to receive grievances which are initiated under Sections L(4)-(6);(c) Prohibited discrimination is defined as any act that either in form or operation, and whether intended or unintended, unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of age, disability, national origin, race, marital status, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation: \"Unintentional discrimination\" is a concept applicable only to situations where a policy, requirement, or regularized practice, although neutral on its face, can be shown to have disparately impacted members of a protected class. The concept is inapplicable to sexual or other forms of harassment which, by definition, result from volitional actions.(d) Discriminatory harassment is defined as any conduct that either in form or operation unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of age, disability, national origin, race, marital status, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation, and that is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work or academic performance because it has created an intimidating, hostile, or degrading working or academic environment for the individual who is the object of such conduct, and where the conduct would have such an effect on a reasonable person of the alleged victim's status. Discriminatory harassment will not be found in the decision to select, include, or assign course or reading materials or curricular content or in the consideration of research topics or investigatory questions within the educational and research activities of University employees and students. However, if specific behaviors or actions opportunistically recur in an educational setting and can be shown by clear and convincing evidence to have been calculated to inflict harm on one or more of the participants, this exception shall not apply.(e) Sexual harassment is a type of gender discrimination which is defined as:(A) Any sexual advance, any request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:(i) Submission to such advances, requests, or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic experience; or(ii) Submission to or rejection of such advances, requests, or conduct by an individual is used as a basis or condition for employment and\/or academic decisions affecting such individual; or(iii) Such conduct is unwelcome and sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work or academic performance because it has created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or academic environment for the individual who is the object of such conduct, and where the conduct would have such an effect on a reasonable woman (if the object is a woman) or a reasonable man (if the object is a man).(B) Sexual harassment will not be found in the decision to select, include, or assign course or reading materials or curricular content or in the consideration of research topics or investigatory questions within the educational and research activities of University employees and students. However, if specific behaviors or actions opportunistically recur in an educational setting and can be shown by clear and convincing evidence to have been calculated to inflict harm on one or more of the participants, this exception shall not apply.(f) In the case of allegations of disability \"complainant\" shall be broadened to include members of the public applying for admission as students, attending (or desirous of attending) events or participating (or desirous of participating) in programs on University owned or leased property, applying for employment, or otherwise having business to transact in University facilities.(2) University Employees' Responsibilities in Dealing with Allegations of Prohibited Discrimination or Sexual Harassment: The University has the responsibility to prevent prohibited discrimination from occurring in its work-places and its academic, research, public, and student service programs:(a) University employees with credible evidence that any form of prohibited discrimination is occurring have the responsibility to inform their supervisors or the Office of Affirmative Action. Credible evidence is evidence of the kind that prudent people would rely on in making important personal or business decisions.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the above, University employees designated as an \u201combudsperson\u201d who receive information about prohibited discrimination from persons participating in the University\u2019s ombuds program are not required to disclose that information to other persons, unless:\u00a0 (1) the person providing the information consents to the disclosure;\u00a0 or (2) failing to disclose information could create an imminent risk of serious harm;(b) Staff in the Office of Affirmative Action shall provide information about available complaint processes, services for complainants, and assistance with resolving complaints to any University employee who makes a report of alleged discriminatory behavior so that these employees may pass on this advice to those involved who may need this information;(c) In making such reports, University employees may retain their anonymity;(d) Staff in the Office of Affirmative Action will advise potential complainants of the options available to them, including applicable internal formal and informal complaint and resolution processes, as well as the possibility of filing with an external agency. Potential complainants shall receive the addresses and phone numbers of external governmental agencies with authority to deal with their complaints, as well as information about any time limitations on access to outside agencies' processes.(3) Discrimination Grievance Counselor: As required by UO Policy 580.015(R), the University has appointed a discrimination grievance counselor who is the Director of the Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity (hereinafter referred to in this policy as the Director). The Director shall assist students and others in formulating and following up complaints of alleged discrimination.(4) Formal Complaint Processes:(a) All members of the University community considering filing a formal complaint alleging prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment are encouraged to contact the Office of Affirmative Action for information and advice. Potential complainants may remain anonymous. Affirmative Action staff will work for resolution through informal processes if that is what the complainant desires, or will assist in making a formal complaint and setting it into the formal complaint process applicable to the complainant;(b) Faculty who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by any employee or agent of the University may file formal complaints under the faculty grievance process as set forth in this policy;(c) Officers of administration who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by any employee or agent of the University may file formal complaints under the OA grievance process;(d) Members of recognized collective bargaining units at the University of Oregon who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by any employee or agent of the University may file formal complaints under the grievance process set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement;(e) Students who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by any employee or agent of the University may file formal complaints under the University\u2019s discrimination complaint process, UO Policy 580.015(R) et seq.;(f) Anyone who believes he or she has been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by any University student while on campus or at a University-sponsored event may file formal complaints with the Coordinator of Student Conduct;(g) A complainant alleging disability discrimination who is not faculty, staff, or a student shall have the grievance investigated by the Human Rights Investigator of the Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity, with the Investigator's report to go to the appropriate Vice President (who may consult with the Affirmative Action Administrative Council before disposition) who shall promptly and equitably decide the grievance and issue a report of the decision to the complainant and to the person (or unit) grieved against.(h) When a University officer, other than the University's designated discrimination grievance counselor, receives a properly filed formal grievance or complaint alleging prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment, that officer shall:(A) Inform the Director that a complaint has been received and name the complainant and respondent;(B) Request Affirmative Action staff assistance in investigating, seeking resolutions and\/or advising the individuals concerned about established procedures; and(C) Keep the Director informed as the complaint or grievance is processed and decided.(h) For purposes of this policy, \"University officer\" is defined as any faculty member with appointment as an officer of instruction, administration, or research;(i) When the Director learns of a formal complaint through the channels described in subsection (g) of this section, he or she shall provide the complainant information about the availability of complaint channels through outside agencies, along with these agencies' names, addresses, and telephone numbers and a description of any applicable time limitations.(5) Informal Complaint and Resolution Processes:(a) Faculty, staff, or students who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment are encouraged to contact the Affirmative Action Office for information, advice, and assistance in resolving the problem;(b) Faculty, staff, or students who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment may contact the University Ombud Officer for information, advice, and assistance in resolving the problem;(c) Faculty, staff, or students who believe they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment may use any appropriate informal grievance resolution process set out in this policy, may secure the assistance of mediators, counselors, or advocates as provided or at the complainant's expense, and\/or may attempt any informal resolution appropriate to the particular circumstances;(d) Individuals seeking informal resolution of a problem of alleged prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment or who merely wish to discuss their experience with an officer of the University, may request anonymity, and need not reveal their identity to the alleged offender. However, when the circumstances are such that, assuming the allegations are true, the health or safety of individuals is at risk, University officers have the responsibility to take such steps as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury. In some cases, that may mean that a complainant's identity must be revealed.(6) University Officers' and Supervisors' Responsibilities as Participants in Informal Complaint and Resolution Processes: When any University officer (as defined in section L(4)(h) of this policy) is called upon to assist in the informal resolution of a complaint of prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment, he or she shall:(a) Take steps to assure that complainants understand their rights, know where they can seek psychological, procedural, or advocacy help, and take reasonable steps to assist complainants to resolve the problem. Professional advice and information on how to advise and assist individuals who feel victimized by prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment is available from the Affirmative Action Office;(b) Ask the complainant if he or she is willing to participate in an investigation of the allegations, understanding that anonymity cannot be guaranteed in most investigative situations. If the complainant is not so willing; then(c) Ask the complainant if she or he is willing to act as a witness if the University decides to instigate disciplinary procedures against the alleged offender. If the complainant is not so willing, then(d) Notify the Affirmative Action Office in general terms that an allegation of prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment has been made. No information that would identify either the complainant or the alleged offender should be communicated to the Affirmative Action Office, unless the situation rises to one described in section L(5)(d) of this policy. Available information about the parties or the setting in which the alleged prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment took place should be given to Affirmative Action to the extent that it does not breach the confidentiality of the complainant or the alleged wrong-doer;(e) If the complainant would be willing to participate in an investigation of the allegations or act as a witness in the event of any future formal charges, the University officer shall notify the Affirmative Action Office that an informal complaint of alleged prohibited discrimination\/sexual harassment has been received and name both the complainant and the respondent. If the complainant is willing, the University officer should help set up a meeting for the complainant with Affirmative Action staff to discuss the situation;(f) Report back to the Office of Affirmative Action about any action taken to achieve informal resolution of the problem.(7) Record Keeping Requirements: The Director shall:(a) Maintain a confidential file of all formal complaints and grievances alleging prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by University employees. Such files shall include the final decision made in the grievance process;(b) Maintain a confidential file of all informal complaints alleging prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment by University employees made by complainants who participate in investigations or are willing to act as witnesses. The file shall include information about any resolution reached through informal processes and any findings made regarding the allegations of discrimination;(c) Maintain a statistical record of the complaints filed and their outcomes as described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, which includes the characteristics of complainants and respondents, including student, staff, or faculty status, home department, and where the discrimination or harassment was alleged to take place: in the classroom, laboratory, or other instructional context, in the workplace, or off campus;(d) Maintain a statistical record of the number of informal complaints of prohibited discrimination\/sexual harassment that are reported, in which the complainant declined to participate as a witness in any future action against the alleged offender;(e) After a period of five years, destroy those files applicable to allegations of discrimination or sexual harassment in which the complainant wished merely to report and not participate in investigations or disciplinary proceedings, and those files in which no prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment was found, when in the interim, no such subsequent allegations against that particular employee are made;(f) After a period of seven years, destroy the files applicable to allegations of discrimination or sexual harassment in which prohibited behavior was found, when in the interim, no such subsequent allegations against that particular employee are made;(g) Four years after an employee against whom complaints of discrimination or sexual harassment have been filed resigns, retires, or dies, destroy any files applicable to the complaints that were not destroyed under subsections (e) and (f) of this section.(8) Reporting Requirements: The Director shall:(a) On at least an annual basis, issue a statistical report to the President, the University of Oregon News Bureau, and the Oregon Daily Emerald of the number and kinds of discrimination and sexual harassment complaints received and how they were resolved. No names of individual\u2019s involved or other identifying information may be released in this report. Data relating to allegations of sexual harassment shall be reported separately from other forms of prohibited discrimination. Further break-downs by category may be used if confidentiality can be preserved and if doing so will make the figures more meaningful to the public;(b) Report to the President that a second or subsequent complaint of prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment has been lodged against a particular employee when there is a discrimination or sexual harassment file being maintained in the Affirmative Action Office naming the employee as the respondent in a formal or informal complaint.(9) Protection of Complainants, Prohibition Against Retaliation:(a) Employee complainants may request to be transferred for the duration of the complaint proceeding. Student complainants may request to change or drop a course while the complaint is in process. Complainants may request, and the University may propose, that other actions be taken that are appropriate and reasonably likely to diminish conflict or relieve the stress involved in complaint processes;(b) A complainant shall have the option of withdrawing the complaint at any time prior to the issuance of a final decision under the selected grievance process, or may choose to file the complaint with an outside agency at any time;(c) Retaliation by any University student or employee against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination, sexual harassment, or other complaint process, whether informal or formal, is strictly forbidden. Retaliation is considered unprofessional behavior and is therefore proscribed conduct under University policy and is cause for sanctions more severe than a written reprimand. Retaliation is also a violation of the Student Conduct Code and is cause for sanctions imposed under the provisions of that Code.(10) Sanctions: After following the appropriate disciplinary procedures affording students and employees required due process, the University may impose sanctions as follows:(a) Faculty and officers of administration found to have engaged in prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment may be subject to a written reprimand to be included in the personnel file or other sanctions for cause under the provisions of UO Policy 580.021.0300-470(F) et seq. and the OA performance management policies and procedures. Employees may also be subject to evaluations of less than fully satisfactory service. If a proven or stipulated incident of prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment occurs after the delivery of a written reprimand or an evaluation of less than fully satisfactory service arising out of such conduct, procedures to impose further sanctions for cause shall be instituted under UO Policy 580.021.0300-470(H) et seq and\/or discipline will be imposed under the OA policies and procedures. Possible sanctions include suspension or termination of employment;(b) Students found to have engaged in prohibited discrimation or sexual harassment may be subject to sanctions including suspension or expulsion under the Student Conduct Code;(c) Classified staff members found to have engaged in prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment may be subject to written reprimand to be included in personnel files or further sanctions in accord with the progressive discipline concept in accordance with any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Such sanctions include suspension, reduction of pay, and termination of service.Student Grievance Procedures\u00a0M. Introduction(1) Sections M through R apply as specified to students including undergraduate, post baccalaureate, community education, and graduate students. For the purposes of this policy, a student is an individual who, having paid the appropriate fee or having the fee officially waived, is enrolled in courses at the University of Oregon or was so enrolled at the time the action grieved occurred:(a) Work-Related Graduate Teaching Fellow Grievances: Graduate students with complaints arising from their employment as Graduate Teaching Fellows shall follow the grievance procedures specified by their applicable collective bargaining agreement;(b) Student Versus Student Complaints: Students who wish to make a formal complaint against a fellow student or students or a student group (unless the complaint is against a student for actions taken as a University employee) shall use the procedures specified in the Student Conduct Code, Policy III.01.01;(c) Fees, Fines, and Other Charges: Students with grievances related to the assessment of fines, imposition of charges or the applicability of but not the waiver of fees, shall use the procedures described in Policy 571.060(A) et seq.;(d) Financial Aid: Students who face the loss, reduction or suspension of financial aid other than as an application against delinquency pursuant to federal, or state law, or published Oregon State Board of Higher Education or University policies or directives, may request a contested case hearing under OAR 571-002-0000 et seq.

Students wishing to alter a decision affecting them should contact the office responsible for making the decision to see if there is a procedure established for petitioning for a change. The University administration reserves the right to create petition processes that comply with the requirements of Section N or to eliminate petition processes as it deems desirable;(h) Graduate Student Academic Grievances: A graduate student with an academic grievance including graduate qualifying examinations, comprehensives, dissertation preparation, research evaluation, doctoral orals, or advising relationships shall use the procedures established under Section Q;(i) Family Housing Grievances: Individual family housing resident's grievances against University Housing shall proceed solely under UO Policy 571.022.0020-80(E);(j) Other Grievances: A student who believes that one or more University of Oregon agents or employees has acted in an arbitrary manner or has acted in non-compliance with federal or state law, policies, directives, or administrative rules, or has acted in a way that exceeds authority or abuses discretion, to the personal detriment of that student, shall file a grievance under the process described in Sections O and P .(2) General Guidelines:(a) Statements of Grievance: Formal grievances filed by students under this policy shall be in writing and shall include at least the following information:(A) The approximate date and nature of the events that lead to the filing of the grievance;(B) The names of all persons the aggrieved knows to have been directly involved in or responsible for the events alleged;(C) All the relevant facts the aggrieved knows that support these allegations, including any stated policies or procedures that are alleged to have been violated. The aggrieved may add to this statement if more information becomes available during the course of the grievance;(D) The relief the aggrieved seeks to resolve the grievance.(b) No Retaliation: Students using this or any other authorized grievance process shall be protected from retaliation for using the process. While the actions that have prompted the grievance may be carried out in due course while the grievance is pending and normal academic processes and events including testing and grading shall go on unimpeded, no other actions proposed subsequent to the filing of the grievance adverse to the student's interests may be taken unless those proposing such action can prove to the appropriate vice president's satisfaction that such action is free of retaliatory intent;(c) Grievance Counseling: Students who are uncertain whether a problem can be addressed through a petition process, a grievance process under this policy, or through another resolution process, should consult the ASUO Office of Student Advocacy or the Office of Student Affairs;(d) Choice of Process: In some cases students may have a choice of formal procedures under which to file grievances and complaints rising from the same incident. In such situations, the affected student must select one and only one formal process. The University shall not hear a second complaint from the same student on the same facts, and shall not hear a grievance if a similar complaint is filed with an external agency or court. Preliminary efforts at informal solution shall not be deemed the filing of a grievance;(e) Advice and Counsel: Student complainants may secure advice and counsel as they see fit throughout both the formal and informal procedures described herein. Participation by advisers in meetings or hearings shall be permitted to the extent provided for in this policy. A University officer may refuse to include a student's adviser in such a meeting, unless the student advises the officer, at least five working days in advance of the meeting, that a named adviser will be present. During the course of a student grievance, all parties shall be responsible for the costs, if any, of their personal representation;(f) Time: All mention of days throughout Sections M through Rare calendar days unless otherwise specified;(g) Personal Records: By filing a complaint under any student grievance policy, a student authorizes the appropriate authority to inquire into the matter as necessary to discover the applicable facts and to communicate as specified in this policy, its findings and reasons to the concerned parties.N. Student Petition Processes(1) Mandatory Use: The University has established a number of formal petition processes that apply when students wish to request a waiver of or exception to University policy or procedure which applies to them. Where such a process has been established, students must follow that process to have their requests considered.(2) Procedural Requirements: University offices with established petition processes shall make reasonable efforts to publish the availability of the process, shall train staff to advise students on the use of the process, and shall maintain an adequate store of appropriate petition forms or other relevant materials.(3) Informal Petitions: Where no formal petition process is established, students are free to request reconsideration of decisions affecting them by writing to the decision-maker and making such a request.(4) Grounds for Appeal: The denial of a petition is not a subject for a grievance complaint unless the student believes prohibited discrimination, abuse of discretion or arbitrary and capricious action has occurred. If this appears to be the case, the student may file a grievance under Sections O and P of this policy or under Policy 580.015(R),.O. Procedural Requirements(1) Students (as defined in Section M(1)) who believe they have been individually wronged by arbitrary or capricious action or non-action, abuse of administrative discretion, or non-compliance with applicable law, rules, or policies by the University, its agents and employees, may grieve in accordance with the procedures outlined in the applicable policy.(2) A student must institute a formal grievance within 45 days of the time the student knows or by reasonable diligence should have known of the matter prompting the grievance. The running of the 45 day period shall be suspended during examination and vacation periods, including the period between the end of spring term and the beginning of fall term if the student is not enrolled in summer session.(3) All decision-makers' written decisions required by this policy shall include a statement of findings and conclusions, a recitation of the applicable facts and the law, rules, and policies which support the conclusions, and a description of any appeals procedures available to the parties to the grievance.(4) If the decision at any level requires taking action, the decision shall include a copy of the instructions to the appropriate University personnel for implementing that action.(5) Failure of a decision-maker at any level to communicate the decision within the applicable time limits shall permit the aggrieved to proceed to the next step. The failure of the aggrieved to appeal a decision within the time limits shall be deemed to be an acceptance of the decision.(6) Informal Resolution: Before filing formal complaints, students are urged to consider direct conversation with the individual causing the problem or with that person's supervisor, in an effort to resolve misunderstandings and to achieve solutions as quickly as possible. The use of informal processes does not prevent the filing of a formal grievance so long as the formal grievance is filed within the applicable time limits:(a) Informal Discussion: Students may request a meeting with the problem-causing person or with that person's supervisor;(b) Mediation: Students may request mediation through any available campus mediation program;(c) Local Processes: Students may use any informal processes established within the unit in which the complaint arose.P. Formal Grievance(1) Students may choose to proceed directly to a formal grievance process, or they may wish to file a formal grievance if they believe informal efforts at resolution have failed. Formal grievances must meet the requirements stated in Sections O(1) and O(2).(2) Step One: An aggrieved student shall either file a written complaint according to the established grievance process within the appropriate administrative unit or if one is not established, with the immediate supervisor of the person grieved against. The complaint shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section M(2)(a):(a) A University employee who receives a grievance under this rule that has as its basis allegations of prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment against a student shall direct the complainant and the grievance to the Office of Affirmative Action for a proper filing under Policy 580.015(R);(b) If mediation did not take place in an effort to reach an informal resolution, the Step One decision-maker, who believes mediation could be productive and if the aggrieved and the person grieved against agrees, may refer the matter to any available campus mediation service. Such mediation suspends the time limits described in this subsection for up to 30 days or until mediation is concluded, whichever is earlier. If the grievant does not agree to mediation, the Step One decision-maker shall proceed with the investigation of allegations in the grievance;(c) The Step One decision-maker or a designee may investigate the allegations contained in the grievance and interview the parties and others as appropriate in order to come to a decision on the issues in question. The Step One decision-maker shall either deny or resolve the grievance within 20 days of receipt of a written grievance, except if mediation is undertaken, as described in Section O(6). The Step One decision-maker shall communicate his or her decision to the parties to the grievance in the form required in Section O(3).(3) Step Two: Complainants who are dissatisfied with the decision at Step One may appeal by filing a written notice of appeal within 14 days of receiving the decision at Step One. The appeal shall contain a copy of the Step One decision, a statement of the issues remaining unresolved, and a description of the relief or resolution sought:(a) Grievances against faculty may be appealed to the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances or as an alternative, to the appropriate Vice-President (see subsection (b) of this section). The Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances operates under the charge, procedures and time lines stated in Section F(3). No person involved as a party to the grievance or as a participant in either the informal resolution efforts or the decision-making at Step One of the formal grievance process shall serve on the Student-Faculty Committee on Grievances when it considers a grievance under this subsection;(b) Grievances against any University employee may be appealed to the Vice-President to whom the grieved-against person reports. The Vice President may elect to investigate the grievance or to designate an investigator, or may decide the grievance on the record already assembled. Both parties shall have access to the record presented to the Vice-President (including all documents and communications relied on by the Step One resolver and the Step Two investigator) and shall have the opportunity to comment on it before the Vice President's decision. The record of the grievance includes all statements and evidence submitted by the parties and the Step One decision report. The Vice-President shall have 30 days from receipt of the grievance to investigate and render a decision in writing. Within that time, the decision shall be given to both the aggrieved and the person grieved-against.(4) Step Three: If either or both parties to the grievance are dissatisfied with the result of Step Two, they may file a written appeal to the University President within 14 days of receiving the Step Two decision. The President may elect to decide the grievance on the record already assembled, may elect to investigate personally or by appointing an investigator, or may remand the grievance to the decision-maker at Step Two for further clarification and additions. Both parties shall have access to the record presented to the President upon appeal and shall have the opportunity to comment on it before the President makes a decision. The same records considerations apply to this step as to those before. The President shall render a written decision within 60 days of the receipt of an appeal. Both parties shall receive a copy of the Step Three decision. The President's decision is final.(5) Withdrawing the Grievance: The grievance may be withdrawn by the aggrieved at any step in this procedure by submitting a signed and dated written notice to the decision-maker who currently is considering the grievance.(6) Extensions of Time: Time limits within this rule may be extended by the decision-maker when to do so will enhance the fairness of the process, by giving written notice to all parties.(7) Failure to appeal a decision at any step within the specified time shall terminate the grievance.Q. Graduate Student Academic Grievances(1) A graduate student with a grievance concerning graduate qualifying examinations, comprehensives, dissertation preparation, research evaluation, doctoral orals, advising relationships, or other academic grievance shall use the procedures established under this policy.(2) A graduate student must institute a formal grievance within 45 days of the time the student knows, or by reasonable diligence should have known of the matter prompting the grievance:(a) For the purposes of this policy, a graduate student is an individual who, having been formally admitted into a recognized graduate degree program, and having paid the appropriate fee or having the fee officially waived, is enrolled in University courses for academic credit, or was so enrolled at the time the action grieved occurred;(b) The running of time under this policy shall be suspended during examination and vacation periods, including the period between the end of Spring term and the beginning of fall term if the student is not enrolled in summer session, unless both parties agree not to suspend the time limits. After the filing of a formal grievance, more time may be allowed at any level if both the aggrieved and the decision-maker agree more time is needed;(c) In addition to stating the decision-maker's conclusion, all written decisions shall include a recitation of the applicable facts and the law, rules, and policies which support the conclusion:(A) If the decision at any level requires taking action, the decision shall include a copy of the instructions to the appropriate University personnel for implementing that action;(B) Failure of a decision-maker at any level to communicate the decision within the applicable time limits shall permit the aggrieved to proceed to the next step. The failure of the aggrieved to appeal a decision within the time limits shall be deemed to be an acceptance of the decision.(3) Informal Resolution: Before filing formal complaints, students are urged to consider direct conversation with the individual causing the problem, or the appropriate department head or dean, in an effort to resolve misunderstandings and to achieve solutions as quickly as possible. Graduate students may also consult with the Dean of the Graduate School in trying to achieve an informal solution to their problem.(4) Formal Process:(a) Step One: The graduate student shall file a written grievance with the department head, department grievance committee, the college\/ school grievance committee, or the dean, whichever is applicable:(A) The student's statement of the grievance shall comply with the requirements of Section M2)(a);(B) A University employee who receives a grievance under this policy which alleges illegal discrimination against a student including sexual harassment, shall send a copy of the grievance to the Assistant to the President for Legal Affairs and to the Office of Affirmative Action;(C) The decision rendered at Step One shall be in writing and shall be provided to the aggrieved and all other named parties to the grievance within 30 days of the receipt of the formal grievance.(b) Step Two: If the aggrieved graduate student is dissatisfied with the decision at Step One, the aggrieved shall file a written appeal of that decision to the dean of the school\/college, or if the dean made the decision at Step One, to the Dean of the Graduate School, within 14 days of receipt of the decision made at Step One:(A) The dean to whom the appeal is addressed may decide the grievance on the record presented or may investigate the grievance, appoint a designee to investigate, or refer the grievance to an appropriate committee or group to investigate;(B) The decision rendered by the dean to whom the appeal was addressed shall be in writing and shall be provided to the aggrieved and all other named parties to the grievance within 30 days of the receipt of the formal grievance;(C) If the appeal is to the Dean of the Graduate School, see the procedure set forth in subsection (c) of this section.(c) Step Three: If the graduate student aggrieved is dissatisfied with the decision at Step Two, the aggrieved shall file a written appeal of that decision to the Dean of the Graduate School within 14 days of receipt of the decision at Step Two, but if the Dean of the Graduate School made the decision at Step Two, the aggrieved may proceed to Step Four:(A) The Dean of the Graduate School or the Dean's designee shall appoint an ad hoc Advisory Committee normally composed of three members selected from the Graduate Council (one student and two faculty members or three faculty members) to investigate the grievance and to make a recommendation to the Dean of the Graduate School, within 15 days of receipt of the decision made at the prior step;(B) The Dean of the Graduate School shall render a decision, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the appeal, and provide copies of the decision to all the parties named in the grievance.(d) Step Four: If either party is dissatisfied with the Dean of the Graduate School's decision, an appeal may be made to the Provost by filing a written appeal within 14 days of receiving the decision at Step Three. The Provost may decide the grievance on the record already developed or may investigate further, or designate another to investigate. The Provost shall provide a copy of the decision at this level to all the parties named in the grievance within 45 days of receiving the appeal. The Provost's decision shall be final.R.

Requests for reimbursement must be accompanied by receipts, when required.\u00a0 Direct payments\/reimbursements from the University of Oregon Foundation are subject to that organization\u2019s policies and processes.Travel advance funds may be requested from and approved by Business Affairs.When employees travel together, it may be expedient for one employee to pay and claim reimbursement for certain expenses of other employees. Reimbursement for multiple employees is only allowed when actual expenses are being reimbursed and are supported by receipts.

The request for reimbursement must state that the expenses result from a trip by an athletic team or student group.TRAVEL PAID BY OUTSIDE SOURCEOutside entities may reimburse the campus, pay a service provider directly, or reimburse a university employee for travel expenses related to university business. The university will not pay or reimburse for any travel expenses that are also being paid by an outside source directly to the university employee.\u00a0MEAL AND INCIDENTAL EXPENSES[1] GeneralGenerally, meal and incidental expenses are reimbursed at a per diem rate. Meal and incidental expenses may be reimbursed only if the traveler qualifies for lodging-expense reimbursement, except as noted herein.Travelers are eligible for 75% of the meal and incidental expenses per diem amount on the initial and final day of travel.\u00a0 Travelers are eligible for 100% of the meal and incidental expenses per diem on all other travel days.For the day the traveler leaves on a trip, the per diem rate specified for where the traveler will spend the night is used. For the day the traveler returns from a trip, the per diem rate specified for the last location where the traveler stayed overnight is used.Applicable meal and incidental expense per diem may not be claimed if a meal is provided and consumed as part of a hosted function (e.g., a conference registration fee includes a meal, meals are included with lodging rate) or included with a roomette\/bedroom railroad rate or international flight. The per diem rate for a full day's meal and incidental expenses is apportioned as follows:breakfast: 25%lunch: 25%dinner: 50%.Meal and incidental expense per diem is not apportioned for the initial and final day of travel (even if a meal is provided and consumed)[2] Actual Meal-Expense ReimbursementReimbursement for meals at actual expense (including gratuity) instead of per diem rate is allowed when hosting official guests and groups (See Fiscal Policy 56.100 \u2013 Non-Travel Meals, Refreshments, and Hospitality Expenses). \u00a0[3] Meals on One-Day TripsWhen a traveler departs and returns the same day, meal expenses are reimbursed only in the following cases:[a] When traveling as a University of Oregon Board of Trustees member or unpaid member of a university advisory committee[b] When a meal at a convention, conference, or meeting is part of the agenda and the cost of the meal has not previously been paid with the registration fee[c] When directed or required to attend mealtime business meetings, including community or public relations meetings[d] Trips by athletic teams and student groups (see STUDENTS, STUDENT GROUPS, AND TEAMS above)Lunches on one-day trips will not be reimbursed except in circumstances [a] - [d] listed above.The IRS considers breakfast and dinner allowances, figured on the basis of hours worked (such as those permitted under [e] [f] below, to be taxable to the employee. Breakfast and dinner allowances are not available to non-employees.[e] When an employee leaves his\/her official station two or more hours before his\/her regular work shift, s\/he will receive the breakfast allowance[f] When an employee returns to his\/her official station two or more hours after his\/her regular work shift, s\/he will receive the dinner allowance[4] Incidental ExpensesIncident Expenses are combined with meals into a single rate.The university references IRS Publication 463 (Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses) for the definition of domestic-travel incidental expenses and the U.S. Department of State for the definition of foreign-travel incidental expenses.LODGINGLodging expenses are normally reimbursed when authorized campus personnel determine that the traveler would not reasonably be expected to return to his or her residence between work shifts. Generally, lodging is reimbursed at actual cost up to per diem rates. Exceptions to per diem maximum may be granted with appropriate justification. Common exceptions include:ConferencesTraditionally high-cost locations (e.g., New York City; Washington, DC; San Francisco Bay Area; Boston; Seattle)Cities where a per diem hotel is not available within a reasonable distance [e.g., twenty (20) minute drive] of the primary business location[1] Lodging Receipts RequirementsReceipts for lodging are required and must show the following:Traveler's name (or names)Date(s) occupiedItemization of ChargesSettlement in Full[2] Taxes on LodgingLodging taxes at domestic locations are reimbursed as part of the actual lodging cost calculation, but are not included when determining if lodging cost has exceeded the per diem rate maximum.\u00a0 Lodging taxes at international locations are included as part of the per diem.[3] Non-commercial LodgingThe intent of the non-commercial lodging per diem is to reimburse travelers using non-commercial facilities (e.g., travel trailer, motor home, or staying with friends or family members) and should result in an economic benefit for the university. \u00a0For current rate, see [Link to per diem rates]For purposes of reimbursement rates and per diem limits, lodging arranged through services such as Airbnb is considered Commercial Lodging.In certain circumstances, alternate lodging arrangements (e.g., leased apartment) may be considered most appropriate.\u00a0 Contact the BAO Travel Office for additional information and consideration.TRANSPORTATIONTransportation expenses incurred while traveling on official business may be reimbursed. Personal expenses, such as private vehicle repair and maintenance, may not. The following expenses may be reimbursed or paid directly:Common carrier fareRental Vehicle chargesPrivate-vehicle mileage allowanceTaxi or shuttle service fare (including gratuity)Parking and garage feesCOMMON CARRIER FARESTransportation by common carrier is recommended when it is more appropriate and economical than travel by state or private vehicle. Common carriers are usually preferred for out-of-state travel. Actual cost is paid or reimbursed for airline, railroad and bus fares for travel.[1] AirlinesAll employees are encouraged to travel using routes, schedules, and airlines that provide the most cost-effective, efficient travel that meets the business purpose. Economy Plus and\/or Business Class airfare are authorized for any leg of international flights where the elapsed time in-the-air is eight hours or greater. First Class airfare is not authorized.Air travel paid from federal funds must conform to the Fly America Act.\u00a0[2] Taxis and Shuttle ServicesTaxi and shuttle service is authorized between terminals, lodgings, and work stations.[3] RailroadsAll employees are encouraged to travel using routes and schedules that provide the most cost-effective, efficient travel that meets the business purpose. A roomette is allowed when sleeping accommodations are needed due to overnight travel. A bedroom is allowed if no roomette is available or if special accommodations are approved because of the trip's nature or the traveler's health. \u00a0Applicable meal and incidental expense per diem may not be claimed if a meal is provided and consumed as part of the roomette or bedroom rate.[4] Bus LinesScheduled or charter buses may be used.[5] Travel Awards and Frequent Flyer MileageBecause the cost of record-keeping outweighs any monetary benefit, the university will not recapture airline bonuses awarded employees for frequent flyer miles. Frequent flyer bonuses may be used by employees as they choose unless the terms of a grant or contract require otherwise. The university will not reimburse or trade tickets purchased using frequent flyer miles.[6] Payment in Lieu of Air TravelCommon carriers (e.g., airlines, railroads) are usually preferred for out-of-state travel.\u00a0 An employee may choose to travel by private vehicle instead. In such a case, the employee may be reimbursed for ground transportation expenses, including standard mileage, parking, and tolls, up to the cost that would have been incurred had s\/he traveled by common carrier.The following costs associated with air travel can be used as a basis for comparison:The cost of round-trip commercial air fare that would have been incurred. \u00a0An online quote (i.e., Travelocity, Orbitz) should be obtained prior to the travel dates.Private vehicle mileage to and from the air terminal that would normally be used for departure.Lodging, meal, and incidental expenses that the employee would normally incur with air travelPRIVATE VEHICLESPrivate Vehicles may be utilized for business-related travel.The per-mile reimbursement rate is determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u00a0 Employees who receive a Car Allowance Stipend are not eligible for per-mile reimbursement.Mileage for the most direct, usually-traveled route may be reimbursed.[1] Highway mileageUse standard mileage guides, odometer\/tripometer readings, or online mapping tools (e.g., Mapquest.com). Substantial deviations from standard distances or usual routes must be justified. Mileage calculations generally start at the employee's official work station.[2] Local mileageTravel between work places and travel between lodging and restaurants for a traveler's sustenance, health, and comfort may be reimbursed if meals cannot be obtained at the temporary duty or lodging sites. Travel for personal reasons or entertainment may not be reimbursed.Travel between the employee\u2019s home and official work station is considered commuting expense and may not be reimbursed.Employees and agents authorized to use their privately owned vehicles for official business are required to have personal automobile liability insurance to provide the primary coverage for any accidents involving that vehicle. University-provided automobile liability coverage will apply on a limited basis after the employee's primary coverage limits have been used. The university does not provide physical damage, uninsured motorist and personal injury protection for personal vehicles.\u00a0 For additional information, contact the Office of Risk Management.VEHICLE RENTALVehicle rental expenses may be reimbursed. A car, boat, aircraft or other vehicle may be rented when it is the most cost-effective, efficient means of transportation that meets the business purpose. Receipts are required for vehicle rentals. Employees are encouraged to utilize State of Oregon contracts which provide discount rates, car upgrades, and insurance coverage. Employees are also encouraged to use their corporate travel cards when renting vehicles because of the primary Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) coverage provided.[1] Insurance on Rented VehiclesThe university provides self-insurance coverage for rental vehicles if they are to be used exclusively for official business. A certificate of insurance may be obtained from the Office of Risk ManagementIf a rental vehicle is to be used for a mix of personal and business purposes, the university\u2019s self-insurance coverage is only applicable for the portion of travel applicable to official business. The employee or agent will want to check with his\/her insurance agent regarding coverage for personal usage.If the employee or agent plans to travel outside the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada, the department should contact the Office of Risk Management for help in obtaining the appropriate coverage.\u00a0[2] Responsibilities After an AccidentThe renter of a vehicle involved in an accident is responsible for immediately reporting the accident to the Office of Risk Management.LOANED VEHICLESUse of loaned vehicles may be authorized when it benefits the campus. Expense reimbursement is for use of the vehicle regardless of the number of passengers. Some companies may lend vehicles to campuses, departments, or individuals for specified purposes. The operator is reimbursed for actual out-of-pocket expenses arising from using the vehicle for official business.[1] Insurance on Loaned VehiclesThe university provides coverage for loaned vehicles if the campus has agreed in writing to accept responsibility for any liability or damage to the vehicle. The loaned vehicle must be used for official business.For additional information, including the loan agreement form, contact the Office of Risk Management.STATE-OWNED VEHICLESMotor pool vehicles may be used for official state business only. Use of a state vehicle is not authorized when costs are charged to Agency Funds, except for use by Campus Organizations or for other legitimate state business purposes as approved by authorized campus personnel. The department that authorizes a state vehicle's use is financially accountable for damages and all costs resulting from violations of policies relating to state vehicle use.[1] Private Use ProhibitedUsing a state-owned vehicle for private purposes or allowing another person to do so is prohibited (ORS 283.395) and punishable, upon conviction, by a fine (ORS 283.990).[2] Vehicle Safety Including Authorized DriversUniversity policy on Traffic, Parking and Vehicle Safety (former OAR 580-40-0030) provides safety guidelines regarding transportation in a state owned, leased or controlled vehicle.[3] Overnight Parking at Employee's ResidenceA state vehicle may be kept overnight at an employee's residence when doing so is approved in advance by authorized campus personnel.MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSESNecessary business-related travel expenses are normally reimbursed. Personal expenses are not reimbursed. The university establishes the definition of miscellaneous expenses. All miscellaneous expenses must be itemized.Necessary miscellaneous business-related expenses are not reimbursed using a per diem; rather, if the traveler has incurred a miscellaneous business expense as outlined below, that expense is reimbursable at the actual cost.[1] Checked BaggageUp to two (2) standard-weight bags (standard weight as defined by the airline used)Charges for the following may be reimbursed only when necessary for the business purpose and approved by authorized institution personnel (receipts required):additional baggage (more than 2 bags)overweight\/oversize baggage[2] Other Business Related Expenses Normally ReimbursedTelephoneFaxInternetPostageATM cash advance feesMaterials and supplies purchased to meet an immediate business needVisa and passport expensesParkingTollsEnergy surchargePER DIEM RATE REFERENCESPer diem rates for the continental United States are determined using the federal rate in the IRS's High-Low Substantiation Method.Per diem rates for the non-continental United States and Territories (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico) are determined by the US Department of DefensePer diem rates for foreign locations are determined by the US Department of StateOTHER RESOURCESU.S. States & TerritoriesEXCEPTIONSUpon consideration of documented extenuating circumstances, exceptions to these policy provisions may be granted by the Vice President for Finance and Administration (VPFA) or designee.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 4: Business affairs\nOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Prohibited Discrimination (as defined in state and federal law), discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment and retaliation impede the realization of the university\u2019s educational mission and shall not be tolerated at the University of Oregon.\u00a0II. Definitions\u00a0A.\u00a0Prohibited Discrimination is defined as any act that either in form or operation, and whether intended or unintended, unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of age, race, color, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, religion, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or the use of leave protected by state or federal law.\u00a0\"Unintentional discrimination\" is a concept applicable only to situations where a policy, requirement, or regularized practice, although neutral on its face, can be shown to have disparately impacted members of a protected class. The concept is inapplicable to sexual or other forms of harassment which, by definition, result from volitional actions.\u00a0B.\u00a0Discriminatory Harassment is defined as any conduct that either in form or operation unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of age, race, color, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, religion, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or the use of leave protected by state or federal law and that is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work or participation in any university program or activity, including academic activities because it creates an intimidating, hostile, or degrading working or university environment for the individual who is the subject of such conduct, and where the conduct would have such an effect on a reasonable person who is similarly situated.\u00a0C.\u00a0Sexual Harassment is a type of sex discrimination which is defined as any sexual advance, any request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\u00a0Submission to such advances, requests, or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, academic experience or participation in any university program or activity;Submission to or rejection of such advances, requests, or conduct by an individual is used as a basis or condition for employment, participation in any university program or activity or academic experience; orSuch conduct is unwelcome and sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work, participation in any university program or activity and\/or academic experience because it creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working, university or academic environment for the individual who is the subject of such conduct, and where the conduct would have such an effect on a reasonable person who is similarly situated.\u00a0Sexual harassment includes sex and gender-based stalking, sex and gender-based harassment and bullying, dating violence, and domestic violence, defined as follows:\u00a0i.Sex and gender based stalking\u00a0occurs when, based on a person\u2019s sex or gender: (1) a person knowingly alarms or coerces another person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household by engaging in repeated and unwanted contact with the other person; (2)it is objectively reasonable for a person in the complainant\u2019s situation to have been alarmed or coerced by the contact; and (3)the repeated and unwanted contact causes the complainant reasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of the complainant or a member of the complainant\u2019s immediate family or household.\u00a0ii.Sex and gender-based harassment and bullying means any act that: (1) Substantially interferes with work or academic performance; (2) Has the effect of: a.\u00a0Physically harming a student or employee or damaging their property;\u00a0b.\u00a0Knowingly placing a person in reasonable fear of physical harm to the person or damages the person\u2019s property; or c.\u00a0Creating a hostile environment, including interfering with the psychological well-being of a person; and (3)\u00a0May be based on, but not be limited to, the sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity of the person.\u00a0 Gender-based harassment and bullying includes cyberbullying, which means the use of any electronic communication device to perform gender-based harassment or bullying.\u00a0iii.Dating Violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the complainant\u2019s statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of the interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purpose of this definition: (1) Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, causing or attempting to cause sexual or physical abuse, placing another in fear of imminent sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse; and (2) Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of Domestic Violence.\u00a0iv.Domestic Violence means violence between family or household members.\u00a0Family or household members means: Spouses or former spouses; adults related by blood, marriage or adoption; persons cohabitating or who have cohabitated; persons in a past or present sexually intimate relationship; unmarried parents of a child.

Adverse action means any action that is reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in a protected activity. Adverse action does not include petty slights or trivial annoyances.\u00a0 Protected activity means: (1) fulfilling the responsible employee obligations described in this policy; (2) filing a good faith Prohibited Discrimination (including harassment and sexual harassment) complaint with the university or with an outside agency; (3) participating as a witness, advisor, etc., in the university\u2019s resolution process or an outside agency\u2019s resolution process; or (4) participating in the university\u2019s reasonable accommodation processes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0F.\u00a0Student Employee: Student Employee means an enrolled student employed by the university whose employment is contingent on their student status. For purposes of this policy, the term Student Employee does not include Residential Advisors and graduate students with GTF appointments or other student employees who supervise two or more employees. Although student employees are not required by university policy to report, a student employee\u2019s supervisor may set expectations for a position that include reporting obligations. Further, student employees are encouraged to report as outlined below.\u00a0G.\u00a0Confidential Employee: The following employees are confidential employees, meaning that in most instances, they will not share information disclosed to them with the university at large:\u00a0Health care professionals working at the University Counseling and Testing Center (available to students);Health care professionals working at the University Health Center (available to students);Office of Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services employees (available to students); andThe university\u2019s Ombudsperson (available to students and employees).\u00a0H.\u00a0Credible Evidence: Credible Evidence is evidence of the kind that prudent people would rely on in making personal or business decisions, which is not obtained: (1) during public awareness events (For example, \u201cTake Back the Night,\u201d and \u201csurvivor speak outs\u201d);\u00a0 (2) as part of an Institutional Review Board-approved human subjects research protocol focused on Prohibited Discrimination; or (3) in the context of a required classroom assignment. (Note: If a faculty member believes that a classroom assignment may illicit a disclosure that would trigger obligations under this policy, the faculty member should make clear to students that an account provided in response to a classroom assignment, without more information, will not result in the university taking any action in response to the disclosure. This means that the university will not investigate the incident, offer interim measures or otherwise take step to remediate the behavior.) \u00a0\u00a0Please note that credible evidence also excludes information obtained during a conversation that is otherwise privileged or confidential under state or federal law. Examples of this exclusion include, but are not limited to: attorneys, who are not required to disclose information covered by the attorney client privilege; union stewards and union representatives, who are not required to disclose information obtained during a conversation with a member regarding workplace issues (including grievances); and licensed mental health professionals (counselors, psychologists, etc.), who are not required to disclose information covered by an applicable privilege.I.\u00a0Student: For purposes of this policy, the term Student has the meaning set forth in the Student Conduct Code.J.\u00a0Employee: A person in an employment relationship with the university.\u00a0K.\u00a0Campus Community Member: Campus Community Member means a person participating in a university-sponsored program or activity, attending or wanting to attend an event on university owned or leased property, an independent contractor or vendor, a volunteer, a person applying for admissions, a person applying for employment, or a campus visitor or a person living on university-owned property. The term Campus Community Member excludes Employees and Students.\u00a0L.\u00a0Exempt Employees: Exempt employees are those employees who are certified as such by the Title IX Coordinator and who: (1) pass annual training requirements approved by the Title IX Coordinator; (2) provide students who they interact with a notice approved by the Title IX Coordinator relating to their status as an exempt employee and their privacy practices.\u00a0 The Title IX Coordinator may decline to certify as exempt those employees whose duties or other reporting obligations make exemption inappropriate due to their role as supervisors or others deemed campus security authorities or individuals with a role in investigation or responding to incidents of sexual misconduct.\u00a0Exempt employees are not required to report instances of Prohibited Discrimination relating to students; however, exempt employees are encouraged to report all instances of Prohibited Discrimination in the manner described in this policy. If a student shares information regarding Prohibited Discrimination with an exempt employee, the employee is required to provide that individual with information regarding available resources, reporting options, including confidential reporting options, the university\u2019s complaint process and the university\u2019s policy regarding retaliation. Such information will be provided to exempt employees during their annual training.\u00a0 Exempt employees are also required to consult confidentially with the Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services Program after receiving a report.\u00a0 Exempt employees who fail to comply with these requirements may be subject to discipline up to and including a letter for reprimand.\u00a0III. Responsible Employees Reporting Obligations\u00a0Except as provided for in the Student Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Violence Complaint Response (Student Complaint Response Policy), Responsible Employees who receive Credible Evidence of Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment or Sexual Harassment involving an Employee, Student or Campus Community Member are required to promptly report that information as follows:\u00a0If the Credible Evidence relates to Sex Discrimination of a Student, Responsible Employees should report any information received to the Title IX Coordinator or to the Office of Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services. (Note: The Student Complaint Response Policy applies to information disclosed by a student reporting sex discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual violence. That policy may provide for different reporting obligations depending on the status of the employee receiving the report. Employees who receive reports of sex discrimination (including sexual harassment and sexual violence) against a student should reference the Student Complaint and Response Policy in order to determine their reporting obligations.)\u00a0In all other instances, Responsible Employees should report any information received to the Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity (AAEO).\u00a0Employees should be aware that AAEO is tasked with ensuring compliance with this policy and state and federal law.\u00a0 Therefore, while AAEO will work with employees, students and campus community members to ensure that they understand their complaint options, are protected from retaliation and are provided with interim measures as appropriate, AAEO employees are not advocates for individuals participating in the process.\u00a0Note: The Student Complaint and Response Policy provides for different reporting obligations in the context of students experiencing sexual and gender-based harassment and violence.\u00a0 That policy should be referenced when determining an employee\u2019s reporting obligations in the context of students experiencing sexual and gender-based harassment and violence.\u00a0IV. Confidential Employees\u00a0Students and Employees have the option to share their experience with a Confidential Employee.\u00a0 However, it is important to understand that in most instances, Confidential Employees will not report the underlying actions to the university at large, which means that the university will not take action to stop the discrimination or harassment, remedy its effects or prevent future instances of discrimination and harassment.\u00a0 Further, Students and Employees who report to Confidential Employees always retain the choice to make a complaint, as outlined below. Students, Employees and Campus Community Members with questions regarding the university\u2019s processes are encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator or AAEO.\u00a0\u00a0 For further information regarding Confidential Employees\u2019 privacy practices, please visit the website referenced below.\u00a0\u00a0We recognize that employees who experience Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment or Sexual Harassment within departments, institutes, or programs face unique obstacles.\u00a0 Rather than reporting to other employees who are Responsible Employees, and who may have conflicts of interest based on existing relationships within those units, we encourage employees experiencing Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment or Sexual Harassment to utilize the confidential resources available to them in order to explore forms of support and protection and to fully understand their options relating to filing a complaint.\u00a0Note: Except as provided for the Student Complaint and Response Policy, information reported by Responsible Employees to the Office of Crisis Intervention and Sexual Violence Support Services will be passed on to the Title IX Coordinator. The Student Complaint and Response Policy provides for different reporting and disclosure obligations in the context of students experiencing sexual and gender-based harassment and violence.\u00a0 That policy should be referenced when determining an employee\u2019s reporting obligations in the context of students experiencing sexual and gender-based harassment and violence.\u00a0\u00a0V. \u00a0Prohibited Discrimination Complaints\u00a0Students, Employees and Campus Community Members who have been subject to Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment or Retaliation are encouraged to file complaints with the university as set forth below. \u00a0Individuals may also exercise applicable grievance rights, which are referenced below. Complaints should generally be filed within 365 days of the date the person knew or should have known of the underlying conduct.\u00a0Student complaints relating to Sex Discrimination or Retaliation: Students may file a complaint relating to Sex Discrimination, including Sexual Harassment, or Retaliation relating to Sex Discrimination or Sexual Harassment with the Title IX Coordinator or AAEO. Complaints can be made by e-mailing, calling or visiting any one of these two offices. Students may also discuss their options with a Confidential Employee.\u00a0All other complaints (including Employee and Campus Community Member complaints):\u00a0 All other complaints of Prohibited Discrimination including Harassment, Sexual harassment or Retaliation, may be filed with AAEO. Complaints may be made by e-mailing, calling or visiting AAEO\u2019s office. Employees and students are encouraged to discuss their options for filing complaints with a Confidential Employee.\u00a0\u00a0VI. University\u2019s Response\u00a0The university will take prompt and equitable corrective measures to stop Prohibited Discrimination or Harassment, to remedy the effects of Prohibited Discrimination or Harassment, and to prevent future instances of Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation. If the university initiates an investigation, it will be impartial. In responding to incidents of Prohibited Discrimination, the university will follow state and federal law, university polices and any applicable collective bargaining agreements.\u00a0 Employees and Students may also choose to exercise applicable formal grievances rights. A complaining party\u2019s options will be explained to that person by AAEO or the Title IX Coordinator, as appropriate.\u00a0Against a Student: If the underlying incident involves Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment or Retaliation arising out of an act of Sex Discrimination against a Student, meaning that the Student is the alleged bad actor, the university will follow the process outlined in the student conduct standard operating procedures, referenced below. \u00a0If it relates to other forms of Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment or Retaliation against a Student, the University will follow the process outlined in the Student Conduct Code or the standard operation procedures, as applicable.\u00a0Against an Employee or Campus Community Member: If the underlying action involves Prohibited Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment or Retaliation against an Employee or Campus Community Member, meaning that the Employee or Campus Community Member is the alleged bad actor, the university will generally follow: (1) The discrimination complaint process for complaints made by Employees and Campus Community Members; or (2) The Student discrimination complaint process for complaints made by Students. \u00a0Both of these processes are referenced below.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VII. Interim Measures\u00a0Regardless of whether an investigation or university process is initiated, the university will provide interim measures as appropriate, which for Students may include academic accommodations, housing accommodations, workplace or transportation accommodations, reasonable protective measures, health and counseling services, financial aid, visa and immigration assistance, safety planning, legal support options and information regarding other on and off-campus resources and for employees may include change of employment conditions, information and assistance regarding employee resources and other reasonable measures. \u00a0In\u00a0deciding which interim measures to implement, the university will attempt to mitigate the impact on affected parties, while also balancing the rights of the alleged wrongdoer.\u00a0\u00a0VIII. Confidentiality\u00a0To the extent possible, the university will protect the confidentiality of Responsible Employees, complainants, witnesses and accused parties and, if information is disclosed, will disclose it on a need to know basis. \u00a0However, it is important to understand that: (1) in order to investigate the matter and provide the other party with notice of the underlying allegations and an opportunity to respond, the university may need to reveal the identity of the complaining party, the Responsible Employee and relevant witnesses; and (2) Employees and Students have rights under federal or state law or pursuant to applicable bargaining agreements to review and inspect records relating to an investigation.\u00a0 That being said, for purposes of public records requests and to the extent allowed by law, the university will treat all materials submitted during an investigation relating to a report or a complaint of Prohibited Discrimination as submitted in confidence, unless otherwise noted.\u00a0\u00a0IX. Free Expression and Academic Freedom\u00a0In all its actions, the university will respect the rights of freedom of expression and academic expression, as set forth in university policies and applicable bargaining agreements.\u00a0X.\u00a0 External Complaints\u00a0The university encourages all individuals with a pertinent complaint to follow the process in this policy.\u00a0 However, individuals may always choose to make a discrimination complaint directly with outside agencies or law enforcement, including, but not limited to, the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Educational Opportunities Section of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Contact information for these agencies can be found on AAEO\u2019s website.\u00a0XI. Corrective Action\u00a0If the university finds that an Employee, Student or Campus Community Member has engaged in Prohibited Discrimination, it will take immediate and appropriate corrective action. \u00a0This means that Employees who have engaged in Prohibited Discrimination or Retaliation may face discipline up to and including termination. \u00a0Students who have engaged in Prohibited discrimination may face sanctions up to and including suspension or expulsion. Individuals who make bad-faith complaints may be subject to disciplinary action, student conduct code violations or other appropriate corrective action.\u00a0 Responsible employees who fail to report as required by this policy may be subject to discipline, which may include a letter of reprimand or other appropriate corrective measures.\u00a0 Campus Community Members who violate this policy may be trespassed from campus and may otherwise lose their right to use university property and\/or to participate in university-sponsored programs and activities.\u00a0XII. Differential Treatment Required or Allowed by Law\u00a0Neither this policy or any other UO policy, including but not limited to UO policy 580-15, shall be interpreted as preventing UO from complying with laws that require preferential treatment - like Oregon\u2019s Veterans Preference laws \u2013 or from engaging in Constitutional admissions practices designed to achieve diversity goals.\u00a0\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume V: Human Resources\nChapter 11: Human resources, other\nRelated Resources:\u00a0CONTACT INFORMATION\u00a0Title IX CoordinatorTitleIXcoordinator@uoregon.edu106 Johnson Hall (1098 E. 13th Ave.)(541) 346-8136\u00a0Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity (OAAEO)677 East 12th Avenue, Suite 452(541) 346-3123\u00a0Office of Crisis Intervention and Sexual Assault Support Services164 Oregon Hall (1585 E. 13th Avenue)(541) 346-7233\u00a0Ombudspersonombuds@uoregon.edu1685 E. 17th Street(541) 346-6400\u00a0UO Counseling and Testing Center1590 E. 13th Avenue(541) 346-3227\u00a0UO Health Center1590 E. 13th Avenue(541)346-2770\u00a0\u00a0RELATED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\u00a0Student Conduct Standard Operating Procedures\u00a0Student Conduct Code\u00a0Student Discrimination Process\u00a0Discrimination Complaint Process\u00a0Student Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Violent Complaint and Response Policy\u00a0\u00a0FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES\u00a0Represented Employees:SEIU - Article 17UA - Article 24UOPD - Article 16Teamsters - Article 28GTFF - Article 16\u00a0Unrepresented EmployeesFaculty membersOfficers of Administration\u00a0\u00a0ANONYMOUS REPORTING\u00a0Anonymous reporting\u00a0\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Individuals differ in ability, background, interests, social maturity, emotional maturity and goals. To plan educational opportunities to meet the needs of individual students and to counsel effectively with them, the University must accumulate data and keep records. The personal records enable the faculty and administrators of the University to understand the individual student better and to provide more effective education and counseling assistance.From the time a student enters the University of Oregon and submits the required personal data for academic and personal records, there is an implicit and justified assumption of good faith placed upon the University as custodian of these materials. The University maintains a similar posture relative to subsequent data generated during the student's enrollment. Preserving the confidential nature of student records protects the individual's rights to privacy and enhances the effectiveness of the University's educational and counseling processes. Accordingly, the University of Oregon shall exercise care and concern in obtaining, recording, maintaining, and disseminating information about students, with duplication of records kept at a minimum.The complete text of the University of Oregon Student Records Policy, which takes precedence over all other published versions, is found in the Oregon Administrative Rules Chapter 571 and available at http:\/\/arcweb.sos.state.or.us\/pages\/rules\/oars_500\/oar_571\/571_020.html.

Damage to university reputation or brand,\u00a0 2. Loss of customers (students, donors),3. Financial costs (fines, card re-issue fees, customer notification, credit monitoring, forensic investigation, public relations, and litigation).DEFINITIONSUniversity MerchantAny university department that accepts customer debit\/credit card payments.Customer Card DataAt a minimum, cardholder data consists of the full PAN (Primary Account Number). Cardholder data may also appear in the form of the full PAN plus any of the following: cardholder name, expiration date and\/or service code.EcommerceCard processing method where the customer enters their card data into a web page or application using their personal device.PCI DSSThe Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), founded by major brands American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc. created global security standards that apply to all merchants and service providers worldwide to enhance payment account data security.The PCI security standards include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for merchants and service providers, the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) for software vendors, and the PIN Transaction Security (PTS) for device vendors and manufacturers.SAQSelf-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) is one method for merchants to validate their compliance with PCI DSS. There are eight distinct SAQs (A, A-EP, B, B-IP, C, C-VT, D, and P2PE-HW) each designed for different credit card processing methods and environments.Data Security Incident Response PlanThe plan that is executed by the Data Security Incident Response Team in the event of a potential data breach.POLICY STATEMENT1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The AVP Business Affairs\/Controller is responsible for,a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ensuring university compliance with PCI rules, merchant banking contract terms and conditions, and state law regarding proper handling of public funds.b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The distribution of related policies and procedures.c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Authorizing all debit\/credit card activities at the University of Oregon.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University Merchants authorized to accept debit\/credit card payments will validate their compliance status with PCI DSS at the end of each calendar year.\u00a0 Compliance gaps must also be remediated by University Merchants in a planned and continuous effort throughout the year.\u00a0 Failure to come into compliance with PCI DSS may result in the loss of card acceptance privileges.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University Merchants will limit access to Customer Card Data to employees with a legitimate business reason, and will maintain standard operating procedures for its processing, protection and disposal.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University Merchants will obtain approval from Business Affairs before contracting with a third party for card processing services or solutions.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University employees shall not store Customer Card Data in electronic form on the university network, or send or receive unencrypted cardholder data (for example by email or text message).6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University employees will avoid creating paper records that contain Customer Card Data.\u00a0 Paper records containing Customer Card Data must be confidentially recycled immediately after processing or when the business reason for retention ends.\u00a0 Maximum retention is 1 year.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whenever practical, University Merchants shall adopt low risk processing methods such as:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ecommerce, fully outsourced to service providers validated by the PCI Security Standards Council.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Purpose built payment card terminal, certified by the PCI Security Standards Council.University employees will not enter Customer Card Data on a university computer without a compelling business reason.\u00a0\u00a0 University computers used to process or transmit Customer Card Data must be; hardened, dedicated to this purpose (never used for email, social networking or web browsing), firewalled, segmented from other devices, and scanned for vulnerabilities by an Approved Scan Vendor (ASV).8.\u00a0 The following personnel will participate in formal security awareness training annually;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Employees involved in accepting customer credit card payments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IT professionals supporting university systems that host pay buttons or that process or transmit Customer Card Data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Purchasing and leasing agents who craft agreements with third parties who process credit cards on campus or on behalf of the university.9.\u00a0 In the event of a data breach involving Customer Card Data the university will execute its Data Security Incident Response Plan.Download PolicyChapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 4: Business affairs\nRelated Resources:\u00a0Procedures for implementing this policy are published on the Business Affairs websiteForms\/Instructions\/Regulations:Business Affairs Payment Card Services and InstructionsPayment Card Acceptance Request FormPCI Security Standards Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It is expected that research results will be published or otherwise be disseminated on a nondiscriminatory basis and within a reasonable period of time.Policy Statement:\u00a0University researchers may not conduct proprietary research where the freedom to publish is limited inherently and fundamentally, even if such limitation is intended only to permit University project personnel access to proprietary information.\u00a0 The University of Oregon shall not accept any fundamental and inherent limitation on the freedom to publish from any research sponsor and therefore, shall not accept publication restrictions that convey veto or censorship authority to extramural sponsors of University research projects. Publication delays not exceeding sixty (60) days are acceptable so that a research sponsor may review publications and (1) offer comments or suggestions and (2) determine that its proprietary data are not disclosed. Delays not exceeding ninety (90) days also are permitted so that the University and the research sponsor may screen proposed publications for intellectual property protection. If both sixty- and ninety-day delays are applicable, the total period of delay should not exceed ninety (90) days.Sponsored research projects allowing access to or use of the sponsor's proprietary data or materials will be accepted only if regulations regarding access, use, and protection of such data or materials do not restrict the full dissemination, excluding the proprietary data or materials, of scholarly findings made under the research agreement. Proprietary data or materials must be labeled as such by the research sponsor before release to University researchers, except that proprietary data or materials disclosed orally must be identified, within 30 days of such disclosure, in writing by the sponsor as proprietary, or as otherwise agreed to in writing by University\u2019s authorized representative. Research sponsor requirements shall not proscribe citation of the sponsor name in publications.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume II: Academics, Instruction and Research\nChapter 6: Research, general\nOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

An OA or UFM who takes parental leave under FMLA or OFLA may take the first six work weeks of such leave with pay, in the following manner:As part of the first six weeks of leave, the UFM must use any available short term disability insurance benefits, all accrued vacation leave and all but 80 hours of accrued sick leave. If the UFM does not have sufficient accrued disability insurance benefits and accrued paid leave to cover six weeks with full pay, the University will provide the UFM with the necessary amount of paid parental leave to allow the UFM to receive a total of six weeks paid parental leave. If both parents are UFMs of the University, both parents are entitled to this additional paid leave.Each UFM may use accrued sick leave for his or her remaining six weeks of parental leave (for a total of 12 work weeks of leave). In the event that the UFM does not have sufficient accrued sick leave, he or she may borrow advanced sick leave for the remainder of the last six work weeks pursuant to current policy. Based on the timing of the birth or adoption, this paid leave may extend into a second term for a UFM.To be eligible for the paid family leave benefit described in this Standard, a UFM must be in a Career NTTF or the Tenure-Track or Tenured Professor classifications.\u00a0Use of the benefits described in this Standard shall not adversely affect the UFM's standing or salary in any manner. A UFM who is employed in a Tenure-Track and Tenured position who experiences pregnancy, childbirth, or the adoption of a child and\/or utilizes parental leave shall have the option of an additional probationary year before a tenure or promotional review.This Standard supersedes all policies to the extent that this Standard conflicts, is inconsistent with, or differs from such policies.All units are directed to comply with this Standard until further notice.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume V: Human Resources\nChapter 9: Time-off and leave\nOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

This policy will be implemented in accordance with the Board of Trustees\u2019 delegation of authority to University officers, applicable law, and the University\u2019s established ethics and financial stewardship policies, rules, and procedures.I. RATIONALEStrategic purchasing is the process of negotiating a large-scale contract with a company or vendor that will provide the best price and service in exchange for the exclusive right, with some exceptions, to sell to the buyer.\u00a0 Large enterprises like the University of Oregon frequently buy groups of similar goods and services in nearly each of their various units and departments.\u00a0 This includes, for example, computer hardware, office supplies, copiers, printers, office furniture, event services, and other goods and services.\u00a0 Large enterprises leverage their buying power to get better prices and receive better service by identifying multiple categories of goods and services that can each be supplied by a single vendor.For example, many large enterprises, including universities, will choose a single vendor for desktop or laptop computers, such as Dell, Apple, or another vendor and receive lower prices and better service in return.As the department responsible for establishing University purchasing guidelines, Purchasing and Contracting Services (\u201cPCS\u201d) is responsible for implementing this policy, including determining those goods and services that will be subject to strategic purchasing requirements and individual purchases that will be exempt from strategic purchasing requirements.II. ENTITIES AFFECTED BY THIS POLICYThis policy affects and applies to all entities within the University, including, but not limited to, academic departments, research centers and institutes, grant-funded programs, and auxiliary departments. III. APPLICATION OF POLICY1. Selection of Services and Goods for Strategic PurchasingThe Vice President for Finance and Administration (\u201cVPFA\u201d), or designee, under delegated contracting authority from President of the University, will select those services and goods that must be purchased exclusively from a selected vendor using central University contracts negotiated by PCS.\u00a0 The Director of PCS will be responsible for making recommendations to the VPFA for strategic purchasing following the process described below.Prior to recommending any category of service or good for strategic purchasing, PCS must consult with a standing strategic purchasing advisory committee to determine whether it is in the best interests of the University.\u00a0 The strategic purchasing advisory committee will have access to review the proposed terms and conditions for any anticipated contract for strategically purchased goods and services.\u00a0 The strategic purchasing advisory committee will consist of:One representative from each of at least three academic departments;One representative from the Business Affairs Office;One representative from Information Services;One representative from Sponsored Projects Services;One representative from the Associated Students of the University of Oregon;One representative from Finance and Administration Shared Services; andRepresentatives from any other department determined to be relevant to the category of services or goods discussed.The strategic purchasing advisory committee\u2019s membership described above will include at least one officer of administration and at least one classified employee.\u00a0After consultation with the strategic purchasing advisory committee, if PCS anticipates recommending a category of services or goods for strategic purchasing, it will post its proposed selection on its University internal website, pcs.uoregon.edu, and notify all campus buyers and contract officers of the proposed selection.\u00a0 The online posting of PCS\u2019s proposed selection will solicit comment from campus employees.\u00a0 Campus buyers and contract officers will be encouraged to invite faculty and staff to review recommendations and provide comments.The Vice President for Finance and Administration, or designee, is responsible for determining which services and goods will be selected for strategic purchasing.\u00a0 The VPFA will consider the recommendations of the Director of PCS and the strategic purchasing advisory committee and comments provided by campus employees when making the decision of whether to select a service or good for strategic purchasing.2. Considerations for Selecting Services and Goods for Strategic PurchasingPCS and the strategic purchasing advisory committee will consider all relevant information, including, but not limited to, the following items when determining whether to select a category of services or goods for strategic purchasing:The number of University departments that purchase the service or good;The ability to fulfill the needs and specifications of each department with one vendor;The ability to contract for exceptions, to the extent necessary, to the vendor\u2019s exclusive right to provide the services or goods to the University;The cost of integrating and committing to a new product, service, or technology;The level of impact on University personnel;Whether the service or good will cause increased ongoing operational or support costs;Whether the service or good is a creative work or otherwise relies on the unique skill of the individual rendering the service or making the good;The amount of money saved by contracting with one vendor to provide the service or good for the entire University; andThe level of service provided by contracting with one vendor to provide the service or good for the entire University.3. Selecting Vendors for Strategic PurchasingPCS will select a vendor for exclusive strategic purchasing through a competitive procurement process.\u00a0 Specifically, each vendor will be selected through a Request for Proposal process as described in the University\u2019s policies located at policies.uoregon.edu and PCS\u2019s procedures located at pcs.uoregon.edu\/content\/statutesregulationspolicies.\u00a0 This includes the use of cooperative or government procurement contracts if it is determined, in writing, that the solicitation and award process for the procurement contract is reasonably equivalent to the competitive procurement process established by the University and the competitive procurement process was advertised in Oregon.4. Exemptions from Strategic Purchasing ContractsThe Director of PCS, or a designee, may grant exemptions from this strategic purchasing policy to allow a campus employee to purchase a service or good from an alternative vendor.\u00a0 The buyer must request an exemption prior to making the purchase.\u00a0 Any purchase from an alternative vendor without prior authorization is an unauthorized procurement as described in the University Procurement and Contracting Code Policy.The Director of PCS, or designee, will consider all relevant information, including, but not limited to, the following items when determining whether to grant an exemption from this policy:The purchaser\u2019s need for required specifications or brands, including, but not limited to, exact specifications required to perform effective research;The purchase is a creative work or otherwise relies on the unique skill of the individual rendering the service or making the good;An alternative service or good can be purchased, implemented, or maintained at a substantially lower price.\u00a0 This also includes the same service or good purchased from an alternative vendor.\u00a0 This consideration depends both on the amount of the purchase and the percentage of savings; andIf time is of the essence for the success of a critical University activity, whether the service or good can be obtained substantially earlier through an alternative vendor.5. Applicable Purchasing MethodsPCS\u2019s selection of an exclusive vendor for a service or good applies to all categories of University purchases, including, but not limited to:Purchase CardDuck Depot online procurement systemPurchase OrdersBanner Purchase OrdersPersonal Service Contracts6. Notification of Changes to Strategic Purchasing DesignationsPCS will notify campus purchasers and contracting officers of any changes to the list of goods and services selected for strategic purchasing and the vendors selected to supply those services and goods.\u00a0 Notice will be provided through email to all campus buyers, purchasers, and contracting officers, and on PCS\u2019s website, pcs.uoregon.edu.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 9: Purchasing and contracting\nRelated Resources:\u00a0Purchasing and Contracting Services Policies and ProceduresOriginal Source:\u00a0UO Policy (New)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The central bank invests the University\u2019s cash balances, makes loans, and manages the University\u2019s debt and liabilities.\u00a0 The central bank, as directed by the Treasurer, may also pay interest for cash balances.\u00a0Over time, and within the University\u2019s risk tolerances, the central bank\u2019s purpose is to optimize the University\u2019s resources while balancing competing objectives to:Meet the liquidity needs of the UniversityMaximize return on investments (within the University\u2019s risk tolerance)Minimize the cost of capital (within the University\u2019s risk tolerance)The central bank provides a stable cost of capital to finance projects needed to meet the University\u2019s strategic objectives by lending money to various units within the University.\u00a0 The Treasurer shall establish the central bank loan rate.The loan rate may be adjusted from time to time but should be set in such way that it can be expected to remain constant over time unless market conditions shift uncharacteristically over a persistent period of time.The cash flows of the University will be analyzed and stress tested to ensure adequate liquidity is available to meet the University\u2019s obligations and to provide early warning of changes needed to the central bank\u2019s loan rate.Uncommitted assets that are created by the operations of the central bank will be used to cover the costs of operating the central bank and other costs associated with managing treasury operations.\u00a0 Remaining uncommitted assets may be used for internal loans, short- or long-term investments, to hedge risks within the central bank, or for the President\u2019s other strategic initiatives.\u00a0CASH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENTThe University will consolidate its cash and reserve balances to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, custody, and administration.\u00a0 Consolidation also helps manage investment risk and balances liquidity strategies with investment returns.\u00a0Investment income received, unless otherwise legally restricted, may be used, at the discretion of the Treasurer, to further the objectives of the University.The University\u2019s consolidated cash and reserve balances will be divided into tiers based on expected liquidity needs and return objectives. Collectively, these tiers are known as the Cash and Investment Pool.\u00a0 Investment activities for all tiers will be guided by the objectives of safety, liquidity and return as described below:Safety \u2013 The investment portfolio seeks preservation of capital by minimizing credit risk and price volatility.Liquidity - The investment portfolio shall maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all disbursement requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.\u00a0 Short-term borrowings may be used to meet the liquidity needs of the University.Return - The investment portfolio shall be managed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return over the course of an economic cycle. Performance objectives will be established for each tier consistent with stated objectives.The Treasurer will allocate funds among the tiers in a manner consistent with this policy\u2019s objectives, as outlined below, and will report at least annually how the Cash and Investment Pool is divided among these tiers.\u00a0 The priority of the policy objectives (safety, liquidity, and return) varies by tier:Tier 1: The Tier 1 portfolio will be used to meet the expected day-to-day obligations of the University including payroll, routine obligations, and debt service. The Tier 1 portfolio shall be invested in such a way to ensure that adequate liquidity exists to meet these obligations.\u00a0 Safety and liquidity are the primary objectives of this tier.\u00a0 The University\u2019s liquidity needs, cash forecast, and risk tolerance will be considered in determining the designated range of cash and investments held in this tier.\u00a0\u00a0 When Tier 1 assets are exhausted, the Treasurer may use other assets of the University or borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the obligations of the University.\u00a0Tier 2:\u00a0 The Tier 2 portfolio will be used to hold funds that, while not needed to meet immediate obligations, are expected to be needed during the annual cash cycle.\u00a0 This portfolio may also contain funds for capital projects and to meet unanticipated liquidity needs.\u00a0 Safety is more important than liquidity for the Tier 2 portfolio.\u00a0 This portfolio can be invested over a somewhat longer time horizon than the Tier 1 portfolio and should, typically, provide better investment returns.\u00a0Tier 3:\u00a0 Remaining cash balances will be allocated to the Tier 3 portfolio.\u00a0 The Tier 3 portfolio represents cash balances that are not expected to be required to support operations, near term liquidity needs, or fund intermediate term projects, and therefore may be invested for an indefinite period of time much like a quasi-endowment.\u00a0 The primary objective of this tier is to maximize long-term real return commensurate with the risk tolerance of the University.The Treasurer will evaluate the following primary risks as part of the investment management process:Interest Rate Risk - The duration and maximum maturity will be limited by portfolio tier in order to manage the impact of interest rate volatility and other market factors on the Cash & Investment Pool.Credit Risk \u2013 Published credit ratings and other public or private research and analysis may be used to evaluate credit risk and create different credit risk profiles for each tier.Liquidity Risk - A target range for liquidity will be established and assets rebalanced on an ongoing basis to meet liquidity needs.\u00a0\u00a0The Treasurer will engage an investment advisor to provide periodic advice to the Treasurer and the Finance & Facilities Committee regarding the University\u2019s investments.\u00a0The tiers of the Cash & Investment Pool are expected to achieve market rates of return over an economic cycle.\u00a0 Investment returns will be measured against appropriate benchmarks.\u00a0The Cash & Investment Pool will be actively managed and allow\u00a0 periodic restructuring of the investment portfolio to take advantage of current and anticipated interest rate movements and other trends.The Board must approve any investment manager that is either not registered to conduct business in the State or Oregon or not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.The Board must approve the use of any depository that is unable to collateralize deposits.The Board must approve the University\u2019s use of investment hedging instruments and other derivatives.\u00a0LIABILITY MANAGEMENTThe University may use debt or other financing agreements to meet its strategic objectives.\u00a0The Board, or its designated Committee, must authorize debt transactions, financing agreements, hedging instruments, and other derivatives when the par or notional amount is greater than $5,000,000.Debt is a limited resource and when contemplating the use of debt, the Board will consider:The impact of new liabilities on the University\u2019s ability to achieve its mission and strategic objectives;The cost of the capital funding source; andHow the transaction affects the University\u2019s ability to meet its existing obligationsThe Treasurer may conduct the following activities without specific Board approval:Borrow for short-term liquidity needs (as outlined in section II(D(i)).Enter into financing transactions for the purpose of mitigating the risk of existing obligations and\/or reducing the overall cost of debt.Enter into financing transactions for the purpose of maintaining compliance with the law or other requirements such as the federal tax code.The structure of each financing transaction is critical and prior to finalizing the structure the Treasurer will:Use tax-exempt fixed-rate amortizing debt as the base case financing assumptionEvaluate the benefit and risk of introducing alternative structures or optionality (e.g. variable-rate debt, bullet payments, puttable debt, tax-exempt vs. taxable debt) against the base caseSelect the structure of debt that optimizes cost, risk, and institutional flexibilityComply with all applicable laws and regulations and develop a written program for post-issuance compliance.The Board acknowledges that a portion of the University\u2019s debt is made up of general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and certificates of participation issued by the state of Oregon and therefore outside of the University\u2019s direct control.\u00a0 The Treasurer is expected to advocate in the University\u2019s best interest with respect to these obligations.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 3: Treasury and investments\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Mission1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The primary mission of the Student Conduct Code is to set forth the community standards and procedures necessary to maintain and protect an environment conducive to learning and in keeping with the educational objectives of the University of Oregon.\u00a0 Founded upon the principle of freedom of thought and expression, an environment conducive to learning is one that preserves the freedom to learn -- where academic standards are strictly upheld and where the rights, safety, dignity and worth of every individual are respected.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Learning is a process defined by the exchange of ideas and the advancement of knowledge.\u00a0 As such, learning entails a community of scholars united by their participation in, and commitment to, intellectual exchange.\u00a0 The University is, first and foremost such a community.\u00a0 Learning also involves reflecting on decisions and improving decision-making in the future.\u00a0 By establishing the standards of this community, the Student Conduct Code serves not just as a disciplinary system, but also as a part of the educational system.\u00a0 Hence, a corollary mission of the Student Conduct Code is to teach students to live and act responsibly in a community setting, with respect for the rights of other students and members of that community, and for the property, common resources, code of conduct, and laws associated with that community, and to encourage the development of good decision-making and personal integrity.\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Students are simultaneously members of the University community and the broader community (e.g. city, state, nation, and world). The Student Conduct Code, and the processes of its administration and enforcement, is directed specifically toward maintaining the standards of the University community.\u00a0 Within its jurisdiction the University may impose disciplinary sanctions against students or student organizations when their conduct materially interferes with the educational objectives of the University or university community member.\u00a0II.

The student organization or governing body may still hold its members accountable in the situation, but must do so in conjunction with the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If sufficient action is not taken in a timely manner by the student organization to correct a violation of University standards, individuals may file grievances with the appropriate governing body, or, if none exists, with the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If, in the judgment of the Vice President of Student Life\u2019s designee, sufficient action is not taken in a timely manner by the governing body, the case will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In deciding whether the group is responsible for the violation, the University will consider whether the following factors are present: a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The violation arises out of a group-sponsored, organized, financed, or endorsed event; b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The organization provides the impetus for the violation; c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The violation occurs on the premises owned or operated by the group; d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A group leader has knowledge of the violation being likely to occur before it occurs and fails to take corrective action; or e.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pattern of individual violations is found to have existed without proper and appropriate group control, remedy, or sanction.\u00a0Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume III: Administration of Student Affairs\nChapter 1: Conduct and Student Activities\nRelated Resources:\u00a0NAOriginal Source:\u00a0Oregon Administrative Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The organizational benefits of family support, as established by national research, include improved employee motivation, morale and capacity for service. These immediate and long-range benefits emphasize the importance of implementing family-support practices.In order to create an environment that results in high productivity while responding positively to the family issues of its members, the University asks deans, directors, department heads and supervisors to:Recognize the existence and importance of family responsibilities;Work with employees and students to understand and accommodate their needs;Establish and implement flexible and responsive practices whenever possible to accommodate employee needs in ways that remain consistent with unit goals.This respectful and supportive environment shall include the continuation of a professional, non-demeaning atmosphere for women who become pregnant and recognition of the legitimacy of requests for reasonable accommodation due to family responsibilities and consideration of such request without recrimination. Requests may include but are not limited to reasonable accommodation in committee meeting times and assignments, flexible work schedules, reserved parking permits, children occasionally in the classroom or workplace, accommodation of space and time for nursing mothers, adjustments to student and faculty deadlines and allocation of resources.Within these guidelines, the responsibility for determining the relevance, feasibility, and timing of implementation of family support practices that produce mutually beneficial solutions rests with the individual's supervisor. Safety concerns and avoidance of disruptions to regular activities will always be factors in such determination.Implementation:Deans, directors and department heads are responsible for implementing this policy, and for assisting unit heads and supervisors adopting successful strategies for family support. The President's office will promulgate this policy and periodically solicit information from each vice-president describing successful strategies for family support.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0Presiden'ts StaffDate:\u00a009\/30\/1995Issued by:\u00a0PresidentRevision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.02 to 02.12.01Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

During this time, the eligible faculty member will continue to conduct scholarly work, student advising, research, and other professional responsibilities, including departmental and university service as applicable to his or her position description.\u00a0Paid parental leave for faculty is defined as the period of time an eligible faculty member is relieved of all responsibilities while receiving full salary and benefits following birth or adoption. This leave runs concurrently with all applicable federal and state leave designations.Policy Statement:\u00a0PAID PARENTAL LEAVE FOLLOWING THE BIRTH OR ADOPTION OF A CHILD:Upon request of the faculty member, a paid leave will be granted following the birth or adoption of a child. During such leave, full salary will be continued immediately following the birth of the child or adoption by the faculty member who is using his\/her accrued sick leave.Following giving birth to a child, the mother uses her accrued sick leave up to a maximum of 12 weeks. In the event that she does not have sufficient accrued sick leave, advanced sick leave may be borrowed for the remainder of the first six weeks from date of birth per OAR Sick Leave 580-021-0040 (5). 2\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the timing of the birth or adoption, this paid leave may extend into a second term or semester, in which case this paid leave extends into the term or semester designated for modified duties.Following the birth of a child, the parent who has not given birth may use all accrued sick leave as applicable. Based on the time of the birth, this paid leave may extend into a second term or semester, in which case this paid leave extends into the term or semester designated for modified duties.Following the adoption of a child, paid parental leave is similarly granted with any accrued sick leave to be used as applicable. Faculty may not borrow sick leave in the case of adoption. Should accrued sick leave be exhausted, the faculty member may continue on unpaid leave status. The department head will consult with the appropriate dean regarding arrangements for replacement teaching and\/or related needs and funding.These leave options do not constitute a change to existing sick leave policy.MODIFIED DUTIES STATUS FOLLOWING BIRTH OR ADOPTION OF A CHILD:In addition to the paid parental leave described above, an eligible faculty member has the option to take up to one term or semester of modified duties at full pay status. Modified duties status provides full or partial release from classroom and classroom-related teaching responsibilities (see definition of modified duties) at full pay following birth or adoption, without using accrued or advanced sick leave. This constitutes an extension of the existing leave policies regarding birth or adoption.2 Because faculty members cannot borrow sick leave for a health condition other than their own, Unearned Sick Leave Advance is only an option for biological mothers. The advance can only be borrowed for the first six weeks from the date of birth as this is the period of time the mother is considered incapacitated for a normal delivery.\u00a0 Therefore, the amount that can be borrowed would be 240 hours based on a 1.0 FTE, less sick leave hours accrued at the onset of the leave. See the relevant Oregon Administrative Rule:\u00a0https:\/\/hr.uoregon.edu\/policy\/leaves\/sick-leave-oar for further information on Sick Leave Advance.Exclusions and Special Situations:\u00a0To be eligible for paid parental leave and\/or modified duties as described in this policy, a faculty member must be employed .5 or more FTE in a tenure-related or career NTTF appointment.When both parents are eligible faculty members, either parent is eligible to receive paid parental leave. The other parent may request leave as allowed under the applicable state and federal Family Leave Acts. Alternatively both parents may arrange to split paid parental leave.Both parents are eligible to receive modified duties status as described in this policy.Procedures:\u00a0The department head or other appropriate academic administrator is responsible for arranging for teaching replacements for both parental leave and the term or semester of modified duties.Funding for both paid parental leave following adoption when accrued sick leave has been exhausted and for the coverage of classes affected by the teaching reduction during modified duties will be borne by departments, in consultation with the appropriate deans.The university and its colleges expect that faculty members giving birth or adopting children will routinely use this benefit. Use of this benefit shall not adversely affect the faculty member's standing or salary in any manner.Any release from or reduction of teaching responsibilities does not mean that the faculty member will be required to carry more than a normal load before or after the leave.Because the timing of births and adoptions is not easily accommodated by academic quarters or semesters, the implementation of modified duties needs to be flexible. Department heads should consult with the appropriate dean regarding any questions or issues that arise regarding implementation.Forms\/Instructions:\u00a0Guidelines for Modified Duties Benefit\u00a0\u00a0Who is Governed by this Policy:\u00a0Faculty.Who Should Know This Policy:\u00a0Faculty.Cross Reference to Related Policies:\u00a0Tenure Extension of Probationary Period Because of New Baby or Childbirth or AdoptionReviewed and Approved By:\u00a0Richard W.

No documents shall be released or information disclosed until University legal counsel determines that the subpoena is valid.D. Access to Education Records by a Student (1) Except as limited in Section F, a student must be given the opportunity to inspect and review the student's education records within a reasonable period of time but not more than 45 days from receipt of the request.

When Prior Consent Is Required for the Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information from Education RecordsExcept as provided in the Act or other applicable law, the University will not disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records unless the student provides a signed and dated written consent which specifies the records that may be disclosed; states the purpose of the disclosure; and identifies the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made. The University will provide the student, upon request, with a copy of the records disclosed.I. When Prior Consent Is Not Required for the Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information from Education RecordsThe University may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record without the student's consent if one of the following conditions is met:(1) The disclosure is to a school official who has a legitimate educational interest.(2) The disclosure is to officials of another school, school system, or institution of postsecondary education where the student seeks or intends to enroll.(3) The disclosure is to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena and the University makes a reasonable effort to notify the student of the order or subpoena in advance of compliance so that the student may seek protective action. If the disclosure is to comply with a federal grand jury subpoena or any other subpoena issued for a law enforcement purpose and the court or other issuing agency has ordered that the existence or the contents of the subpoena or the information furnished in response to the subpoena not be disclosed and University legal counsel has determined that the subpoena is valid, then the University shall not notify the student.(4) The disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. This shall be strictly construed. The factors to be taken into account in determining whether this exception applies shall include the following:(a) The seriousness of the threat to the health or safety of the student or other individual;(b) The need for the information to meet the emergency;(c) Whether the individuals to whom the information is disclosed are in a position to deal with the emergency;(d) The extent to which time is of the essence in dealing with the emergency.(5) The disclosure is information the University has designated as directory information.(6) The disclosure is to a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense.

The University may not disclose the name of any other student, including a victim or witness, without the prior written consent of the other student. This subsection applies only to disciplinary proceedings in which the final results were reached on or after October 7, 1998.(8) The disclosure is otherwise in compliance with the Act or other applicable law.J. Procedures for Seeking Amendment of Education Records(1) Requesting Amendment of Education Records If a student believes the education records relating to the student contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's rights of privacy, he or she may ask the University to amend the record. Such a request shall be submitted to the University Registrar in writing and shall include at a minimum the following:(a) If available, a copy of the record the student is seeking to amend;(b) The specific amendment sought;(c) The reasons why the student is seeking the amendment; and(d) All evidence the student wishes the University to consider. The University shall decide whether to amend the record within a reasonable time after it receives the request. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, it will inform the student of its decision and of his or her right to a hearing. The hearing will be informal but must meet the requirements of the Act.(2) Results of the Hearing If, as a result of the hearing, the University decides that the information is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the student, it shall amend the record accordingly and inform the eligible student of the amendment in writing. If the University decides that the information is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the student, it shall inform the student of the right to place a statement in the record commenting on the contested information or stating why he or she disagrees with the University's decision, or both. Any such statement will be maintained with the contested part of the record for as long as the record is maintained and disclosed whenever the relevant portion of the record is disclosed.K. Availability of Education Records for Research Purposes Education records and information contained in education records may be disclosed to organizations conducting legitimate educational research, testing, accreditation, granting financial aid, or improving instruction if the records or information do not permit identification of students or parents and if the information is destroyed when no longer needed to carry out its specified purposes.L. Records of the Department of Public Safety(1) For purposes of this policy, \"law enforcement unit\" means the University of Oregon Department of Public Safety (DPS) and \"DPS records\" means those records, files, documents, and other materials that are: created by DPS; created for a law enforcement purpose; and maintained by DPS. \"DPS records\" does not mean: records created by DPS for a law enforcement purpose that are maintained by a component of the University other than DPS or records created and maintained by DPS exclusively for a non-law enforcement purpose.(2) Nothing in the Act or this policy prohibits the University from contacting DPS, orally or in writing, for the purpose of asking that it investigate a possible violation of, or to enforce, any local, State, or Federal law.(3) Education records, and personally identifiable information contained in education records, do not lose their status as education records and remain subject to the Act and this Policy while in possession of DPS.(4) The Act and this policy do not require nor do they prohibit the disclosure by the University of DPS records.M. Limitations on the Re-disclosure of Information(1) Except as permitted in the Act, the University may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record only on the condition that the party to whom the information is disclosed will not disclose the information to any other party without the prior consent of the student.(2) Except where exempt under the Act, the University shall inform a party to whom disclosure is made of the Act's nondisclosure requirements.N. Recordkeeping Requirements (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the University shall maintain a record of each request for access to and each disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records of each student. The record shall be maintained with the education records of the student as long as the records are maintained. For each request or disclosure the record must include: the parties who have requested or received personally identifiable information from the education records; and the legitimate interests the parties had in requesting or obtaining the information.(2) Disclosure of personally identifiable information from an education record with the understanding that re-disclosure may occur requires the following record of the disclosure: the names of the additional parties to which the receiving party may disclose the information on behalf of the University; and the legitimate interests which each of the additional parties has in requesting or obtaining the information.(3) Paragraph (1) of this section does not apply if the request was from, or the disclosure was to: the student; a school official within the University with a legitimate educational interest; a party with written consent from the student; a party seeking directory information; or a party seeking or receiving the records as directed by a federal grand jury or other law enforcement subpoena and the issuing court or other issuing agency has ordered that the existence or the contents of the subpoena or the information furnished in response to the subpoena not be disclosed.O. Permanence, Duplication, and Disposal of Student Records(1) Individual education records shall be maintained only for the minimum period of time required to serve the official functions of the office generating and maintaining them. The records shall then be disposed of in a manner designed to assure confidentiality.(2) The permanent retention of education records shall be limited to records that the President or the State Archivist determine to be of long-range value to the student or the University.(3) Duplication of permanent education records shall be minimized. Duplicate permanent records shall be destroyed in accordance with this Policy.P.

Policy number revised from 07.00.02 to IV.07.01.Policy number revised from 4.000 to 07.00.02 on February 2, 2010Revision recommended and approved by the President on October 31, 2006Originally issued February 17, 1989Policy:\u00a0The naming, or renaming, of a building, structure or external space is considered a major event in the history of the institution, requiring due consideration, appropriate due diligence, and consultation.Under authority granted by Oregon Revised Statutes, Chapter 352, and Section 1.7.1 of UO Policy I.01.01 \u2013 Retention and Delegation of Authority \u2013 the Board of Trustees shall be the sole authority allowed to name any university building or outdoor area in recognition of an individual or organization.The President of the University, by this policy, is authorized to name interior spaces (e.g. classrooms, atria, conference rooms, seminar rooms, lounges, etc.) in recognition of individuals or organizations.1. NAMING IN RECOGNITION OF A GIFT:Buildings and structures may be named or renamed for a donor when a gift provides funding for not less than 50 percent of the portion of the cost which would not have been available from other sources (state or federal appropriations, student fees, bonds, etc.). Some exceptions may be granted.2. NAMING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL NOT IN RECOGNITION OF A GIFT:Naming opportunities are generally reserved for donors. However an individual's name may be affixed to a building, part of a building, an interior space, or a landscape element in posthumous recognition of unusually meritorious service to the University or to society at large.Normally, a period of at least one year shall have elapsed between the individual's death and the proposal for naming.Exceptions to the requirement of posthumous recognition may be granted only upon approval by the Board of Trustees.3.\u00a0 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTSSuggestions for naming any building, part of a building, interior space, or exterior space will be made through the Vice President for Advancement to the President.\u00a0 The vice president may receive recommendations from and shall consult with appropriate others (e.g. provost, dean, department chair, director).Suggestions for naming in recognition of unusually meritorious service should include a description of the activities and circumstances that warrant consideration as unusually meritorious. While \"unusually meritorious service\" could be operationalized in many different ways, for the purposes of this policy, unusually meritorious service is likely to describe remarkable activities, circumstances, and\/or experiences of individuals that directly served to advance or provide inspiration in advancing the values and mission of the University.Pursuant to this policy, the President shall make a recommendation on naming a building or external space, or any space named after a living individual, to the Board of Trustees for its approval.\u00a0 The President may make a final decision on the posthumous naming of any internal space. On naming suggestions involving entire buildings or large open spaces, the President will consult formally in confidence with the Faculty Advisory Council. On naming of a smaller, or more local scale, the President may consult confidentially with any advisory groups that he or she feels is appropriate.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Volume IV: Finance, Administration and Infrastructure\nChapter 7: Property, facilities and planning; sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It also implements and incorporates by reference, Internal Management Directives (IMD's) 4.005 and 4.010, adopted by the State Board of Higher Education on April 20, 1990 and as amended September 27, 1991.I. INTRODUCTIONTeaching and research are the primary functions of the University and are nourished by efficient and imaginative administration. Service to the community and nation is an inherent obligation. These four--teaching, research, administration, and public service -- are essential features of academic life at the University of Oregon.The contributions of University employees, and faculty members in particular, are not, however, measured solely by activities directly related to University programs. The objectives of the University are served and its programs enriched by the active participation of its employees in outside activities that contribute to the advancement of the employee's profession or provide an opportunity for professional growth through interaction with industry, business, government, and other institutions of our society.The University recognizes the contributions and achievements its faculty by appropriate promotion and salary advancement and permits them substantial freedom in arranging their academic lives. This freedom is, however, subject to the principle that the primary professional loyalty of a full-time member of the faculty is to the University. The potential magnitude of outside professional activity is such that orderly procedures must be followed to avoid ethical and legal conflicts of interest and to ensure that such activities do not conflict with the proper discharge of University responsibilities.This document provides general guidance as to the distinction between outside professional activities that can be engaged in freely, and others that require consideration of possible incompatibility with University obligations. The goal is not to limit creative interaction between University employees and the outside community, but to provide an ethical framework within which such interaction can flourish. Thus, the outside activities that are subject to special consideration include many that are strongly encouraged by the University. Approval of such activities is an official acknowledgment that they enhance the quality and prestige of the University.This document is not intended to provide specific rules covering all possible situations, but rather to establish the spirit in which professionally related interactions with external organizations should be undertaken. It picks out for special emphasis those areas in which particularly difficult situations could arise, but, in general, it recognizes that personal responsibility, integrity, and high ethical standards are the principal deterrents of conflicts of interest. The safeguards against abuse are the standards required by professional colleagues and the rigorous process by which the University evaluates and selects individuals for appointment and promotion.II. TIME COMMITMENT TO OUTSIDE ACTIVITIESIn general, a full-time faculty member may engage in outside activities related to his or her University responsibilities one day in each seven-day week during periods of full-time employment. A part-time faculty member is allowed to devote to such outside activities a proportionate amount of the faculty member's FTE. A reasonable amount of averaging the time allowance over the quarters or semesters of an academic year is permissible, provided that it does not unduly interfere with the faculty member's primary responsibilities to the University. If outside activities are covered by the exemptions in Section III below, no prior review or approval is required. Prior approval is required for any outside activities that exceed this standard of time.For other University employees, any outside activities requiring time away from work may be undertaken only with the permission of the employee's immediate supervisor.III. ACTIVITIES NOT REQUIRING PRIOR APPROVALThe following describe types of outside activities in which University employees may engage without prior review and approval by the University.A. Professional AffiliationsConsistent with meeting obligations to the University, University employees are encouraged to participate in scholarly, professional, and philanthropic activities outside the University. It is thus appropriate for University employees to accept invitations to serve on advisory bodies or public commissions related to their academic or professional work, as well as to travel to other institutions or conferences for the purpose of presenting lectures, leading seminars or workshops, or visiting the laboratories of colleagues.Such affiliations, if uncompensated except for expenses and nominal honoraria, are not subject to the \"one day in seven\" time limitation that is applicable to faculty members.B. Limited ConsultingUniversity employees are allowed to engage in limited outside consulting work without prior approval. To assure the University that the ability of the individual to discharge in full his or her obligations to the University is not impaired when undertaking outside consulting activities, however, the following principles shall apply:(1) University employees shall not engage in outside consulting work to the detriment of their University obligations.(2) The time devoted to consulting work shall not exceed the one-day-in-seven standard as defined in Part II, above.(3) No engagement that involves a conflict of interest as defined by applicable state law or University policies shall be accepted without review and prior approval.(4) To aid the state in the development of its resources, industries and quality of life, the University's employees, as part of their official duties, may consult and cooperate with public officials on matters of mutual interest or of public benefit, especially on problems that require the research facilities of the University.(5) Official University stationery shall not be used in private outside work. A University employee may, however, use personal stationery or other letterheads carrying his or her University title and may sign reports and letters pertaining to outside work over an official title, so long as it is clear that the University title is used for identification only.C. Outside ActivitiesOutside activities unrelated to university responsibilities and undertaken by faculty on personal time, regardless of whether compensated, are not subject to these Board of Higher Education and institution policies. However, if the faculty member, while on personal time, engages in outside activities which create a potential conflict of interest, the faculty member must provide written disclosure thereof in accordance with IV and V below.IV. ACTIVITIES REQUIRING PRIOR APPROVALA. Definition of Activities Requiring ApprovalActivities requiring approval do not include those described in Section III, above. The following describe types of outside activities in which University employees may engage if the University has granted approval.(1) Acceptance of compensation from, or ownership of substantial equity in, an enterprise that carries on activities closely related to the University employee's area of work;(2) Service in a line management position in such a commercial enterprise or participation in the day-to-day operations of such a commercial enterprise;(3) Service in a key, continuing role in a private or outside public entity.(4) Principal investigators and other key personnel (those directly involved in the conduct and reporting of results) must declare the following in proposals submitted on behalf of the University of Oregon:(a) Any 'significant financial interest', anything of monetary value including but not limited to salaries, payments (e.g. consulting fees or honoraria), equity (e.g. shares of ownership) or intellectual property rights (e.g. receipt of royalties from patents and licenses) exceeding $10,000 a year in income or, represent more than a 5% stake from or in an enterprise where that interest may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, an investigators' professional judgment in conducting or reporting research. Included are the financial interests of researchers' spouses and dependent children.(b) Any 'significant personal interest' anything of monetary value including but not limited to gifts, favors, consulting relationships or other personal considerations exceeding $10,000 a year where that interest may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, an investigators' professional judgment in conducting or reporting research. Also included are personal interests of researchers' spouses and dependent children.B. Procedure for ApprovalA University employee wanting to engage in an activity requiring approval shall submit to his or her immediate supervisor (e.g., department or unit head, dean, or director) a written disclosure and request for approval of the activity.The immediate supervisor shall recommend approval or disapproval of the request, and within 10 days of the submission, forward his or her recommendation to the appropriate vice president, along with a written rationale for the recommendation. At the same time, the recommending supervisor shall also send copies of the package to the dean of the school or college or the director of the unit, if that officer is not the approving supervisor, and to the Vice President for Research, if that officer is not the appropriate vice president. The appropriate vice president to consider a University employee's request for approval is the vice president with administrative responsibility for the activities of the University employee's home department or organizational unit.For those Activities Requiring Prior Approval described in Section IV (4) above:All principal investigators submitting proposals through the Office of Research Services and Administration will be required to declare (at proposal submission) whether activities defined in that proposal implicate a significant financial or personal interest on the part of principal investigators or key personnel.Those declaring a significant financial or personal interest will be required to file a disclosure to the Vice-President for Research and Graduate Studies.The Vice-President for Research and Graduate Studies in consultation with faculty and administrative officers of the University (as appropriate) will determine whether the significant financial or personal interest represents a potential conflict.Where a potential conflict of interest is determined, the Vice-President for Research and Graduate Studies will recommend one of the following:(1) that no action be taken when disclosed interests are determined to implicate no risk to the research;(2) that the research be monitored by independent reviewers or research plans be modified when disclosed interests are determined to implicate manageable risk to the research;(3) that no proposal be submitted unless affected principal investigators and key personnel withdraw from proposal or elect to divest themselves of interests in potential conflict when those interests are determined to implicate unmanageable risk to the research.\u00a0Examples:Example 1. A faculty member in the Chemistry Department who is also a member of the Institute of Molecular Biology, applies for a recommendation for approval of an outside activity from the head of the Chemistry Department. Courtesy suggests consultation with the head of the Institute, as well.The Chemistry Department head sends information copies of his\/her recommendation to the Vice President for Research and to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and forwards a copy to the Vice President for Academic Affairs for decision.Example 2. An employee in the Center on Human Development applies for a recommendation for approval from the Associate Dean of Special Education and Rehabilitation. The Associate Dean sends information copies of his\/her recommendation to the Vice President for Research and to the Dean of the College of Education, and forwards a copy to the Vice President for Academic Affairs for decision.Example 3. A counselor in the University's Counseling Center applies for a recommendation for approval from the Director of the Counseling Center. The Director of the Counseling Center sends information copies of his\/her recommendation to the Vice Provost for Academic Support and Student Services and the Vice President for Research and forwards a copy to the Vice President for Academic Affairs for decision.Example 4. The Office Manager in the Materials Science Institute applies for a recommendation for approval from the Director of the Institute. The Director forwards a copy to the Vice President for Research for decision. No other information copies are required.Upon receipt of their information copies, the Vice President for Research and the dean or director should share any concerns they may have about the supervisor's recommendation, with the appropriate vice president. Such advice should be in writing.Within 10 days of receiving a written disclosure and request for approval, the vice president must communicate his or her decision on the request in writing to both the faculty member and the Vice President for Research.C. Requirements for Written Disclosure and Request for ApprovalThe University employee's written disclosure and request for approval of an activity requiring approval shall fully describe the:(1) Type of work or consulting to be provided;(2) Nature of the relationship;(3) Potential conflicts of interest;(4) Short- or long-term commitment of time and effort including the amount of time, if any, in excess of the one-day-in-seven standard as defined in Part II, above.(5) Expected benefits to the outside entity, University employee, and University;(6) Use of University facilities and support personnel, if any, and the method of reimbursing the University for both direct and indirect costs, if the University approves such use; and(7) Nature of any financial arrangements pertaining to compensation, including equity ownership and other forms of economic value provided to the University employee or any immediate member of the University employee's family.(8) Measures proposed to manage potential conflicts and reduce their risk to the research, sponsor and University.D. Criteria for Reviewing Requests for ApprovalThe outside activity must be appropriate to the mission of the University; that is, it must promise significant contributions to scholarship and knowledge and, when possible, provide appropriate opportunities for students. In judging theappropriateness of a contemplated outside activity, the supervisor should be satisfied that the activity meets the specific criteria listed below. The written disclosure provided under Section C, above, shall be the basis of this determination.(1) The facts and circumstances indicate that the University employee's financial involvement with the sponsoring organization will not affect the conduct of research in accordance with University policies and the highest professional standards.(2) The University's interests will be maintained despite any interest of the University employee in the sponsor.(3) The outside activity will lead to the advancement of knowledge and is not of a routine nature or solely of benefit to the sponsor.(4) The outside activity will contribute to the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service.(5) If commercial privileges are to be granted to a particular sponsor, it is clear that the best interests of the University and the public will in fact be served by this arrangement.(6) A faculty member's total average time commitment to outside activities should not exceed the limit of one day per seven-day week, unless the supervisor determines that the activity will provide extraordinary benefit to both the University and the University employee. The supervisor shall document in writing the rationale for approving any request to exceed the one-day-in-seven standard.(7) There must be no anticipated distortion of academic programs. Involvement with external enterprises must in no way undermine the morale or academic integrity of the University.(8) Care must be taken to insure the intellectual freedom and intellectual property rights of any member of the University community. To this end, consistent with prudent and diligent steps to protect intellectual property through the patent or copyright process, there must be free access to the results of all research conducted at the University. Moreover, the intellectual property of students must be protected.(9) There must be no excessive or inappropriate use of University facilities or support personnel, and the University employee must provide written assurance that the full cost of any approved use of such facilities or personnel will be reimbursed to the University.(10) Except under extraordinary circumstances, holding of a line management position or participation in day-to-day operations within an external enterprise should not be approved for full-time employees. Usually, the only condition under which the employee might remain at the University while carrying out such activities is if his or her appointment is reduced by a fraction consistent with the level of activities. However, this restriction should not discourage the early, exploratory phases of entrepreneurial activity. For instance, management of a fledgling commercial enterprise might be judged consistent with full-time University employment.E. Appeal by University EmployeeA University employee dissatisfied with the decision of the vice president regarding her or his own request for approval of an outside activity may appeal that decision by writing to the President of the University. The President may reverse, affirm, or modify the decision. Within 30 days of receiving the written appeal, the President shall communicate his or her decision to the appealing University employee, to the appropriate vice president, and to the Vice President for Research. The decision of the President shall be in writing and shall include an explanation of the President's reasons for the decision. No further appeal is available.F. ConfidentialityWithin the constraints imposed by State Law, a University employee's request for approval and the written disposition of that request shall be made a part of the University employee's confidential personnel record.V. AREAS OF SPECIAL CONCERNA. Research Activities Undertaken in Collaboration with the Private Sector Must be Appropriate to the UniversityIf collaborative research is undertaken with the private sector, it must be appropriate to the mission of the University. That is, the research must promise significant contributions to scholarship and knowledge and, when possible, provide educational opportunities for students. An appropriate research project is one that exhibits the following qualities:(1) The principal investigator's financial involvement with the sponsoring organization will not affect the conduct of research in accordance with University policies and the highest professional standards. Section IV (A) (4) and Section IV (B) above describe additional definitions, reporting and approval procedures pertinent to research proposals.(2) The University's interests will be maintained despite any interest of the principal investigator in the sponsor.(3) The research project will lead to the advancement of knowledge rather than to routine testing that is of primary benefit to the sponsor.(4) The research project will contribute to the University's mission of teaching, research, and public service.(5) If commercial privileges are to be granted to a particular sponsor, it is clear that the best interests of the University and the public will in fact be served by this arrangement.B. Collaboration with External Organizations Must Not Interfere with the Intellectual Environment at the UniversityThe University environment should promote the free exchange of ideas, information, and materials among students and faculty in all of their forums--classrooms, laboratories, and at meetings,anywhere within the University. In addition, consistent with prudent and diligent steps to protect intellectual property through the patent or copyright process, the formal dissemination of information through publication should proceed efficiently.C. Relations Between Senior and Junior Faculty Should Not Be Influenced Adversely by Interactions with the Private SectorThe involvement of junior members of the faculty with external organizations may or may not be important to their professional development. Senior faculty may be able to assist junior faculty in developing such activities by offering potential opportunities to them and by giving them advice with respect to both technical and ethical issues. It is essential, however, that participation in external ventures not lead to loss of the senior faculty's objectivity in judging junior faculty in issues of promotion and tenure. Objectivity could be compromised by collaboration between junior and senior faculty in external enterprises or by expectations that junior faculty should or should not participate in such activities.D. The Possible Effects on Students of Interactions Between Faculty and External Organizations Should be Carefully AssessedPart-time involvement of graduate or undergraduate students in the external activities of faculty may, under certain conditions, offer the potential for substantial benefits to the education of the student. In each case of such involvement, however, approval should be given explicitly by the department head\/chair or immediate supervisor after thorough discussion with the University employee and student.In considering such arrangements, University employees should be guided by the need to avoid conflicts of interest and to avoid infringement of the student's academic duties and rights. For example, if the outside work is related to the student's thesis, special care always must be taken to avoid conflicts that might hinder the student's progress, delay acceptance of his\/her thesis, or lead to altered examination standards.VI. REPORTING REQUIREMENTSIt is important to record specific instances of professional involvement in external organizations in order to monitor the extent of such interactions and to assess their impact on the primary functions of the University. Because the nature of faculty participation in the private sector differs greatly among disciplines and departments, the details of the most appropriate reporting method must be developed and maintained by each unit individually. At a minimum, each unit shall submit to the appropriate dean or vice president (see IV (B), above):A. Copies of all disclosure statements and requests for approval of activities required by IV (B) and (C), above, andB. Copies of written statements of approval or disapproval of all such requests by University employees for approval of outside activities requiring approval, including in each statement the reasons for approval or disapproval.Some centralization is necessary to ensure that information for the entire University is gathered, and that its format allows ready interpretation outside the unit where it originated. Therefore, by the end of each Fall term, the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies will forward to the Office of the President a summary of the previous academic year's approvals and disapprovals of faculty requests to conduct outside activities requiring approval as well as any changes to the policy for use by the President in making the required report to the Chancellor's Office.VII. REPORT TO THE CHANCELLORThe University President shall report to the Chancellor's Office by August 31 of each year any change in University policy on outside activities and evidence of procedures followed in monitoring faculty and family acceptance of compensation and equity for outside activities of the University employee.VIII. SANCTIONSFailure of a University employee to comply with these University policies and procedures concerning outside activities shall be considered \"cause\" as defined in Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 580-21-325(1)(c), or under any applicable collective bargaining agreement, or other administrative rule. In accordance with OAR 580-21-320, sanctions for cause include oral or written warning or reprimand, removal from an assigned post and reassignment, suspension for a period not to exceed one year, and termination. Sanctions more severe than oral or written warning or reprimand shall be imposed in accordance with the procedure in OAR 580-21-325 through 580-21-385. Sanctions for non-academic employees are determined through progressive discipline and under any applicable collective bargaining agreement.IX. REVIEW OF RULES AND GUIDELINESThe President and the Vice President for Academic Affairs, in consultation with an appropriate faculty committee, shall review these Rules and Guidelines in light of the practice under them and with a view toward their possible revision, no later than two years following their adoption and implementation.\u00a0Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffRevision History:\u00a0Supersedes all previous issues12\/21\/1991\u00a0 Original effective date08\/07\/1991 and 11\/13\/1991\u00a0 Reviewed and approval recommended by President's StaffReissued by President Brand05\/1995\u00a0 Revised and approval recommended by President's Staff10\/01\/1995\u00a0 Revisions to be effective2001\u00a0 Edited and Approval Recommended by President's Staff02\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.095 to 09.00.05Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Before an employee shall become a candidate for any public office, whether for a salaried or non-salaried position, the employee is expected to consult with the president.(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Political activity shall in no way interfere with the performance of the major duties prescribed by the university.(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because circumstances under which a campaign is conducted will vary widely depending on the nature of the elective office and the extent of opposition, the determination of whether an employee may continue full-time duties while conducting or engaged in a campaign rests with the employee's president. In the event of election to the State Legislature, an employee normally will be placed on leave of absence without pay during the period of full-time responsibility. If elected or appointed to a full-time salaried office, the employee may be placed on leave of absence without pay during the term of office or may be required to resign.Chapter\/Volume:\u00a0Original Source:\u00a0OUS Board Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The initial appointment will be for one year and, if service is considered fully satisfactory, subsequent appointments as Instructor may be made until the faculty member has served eighteen terms (counting only those terms in which the appointment has been at 0.5 FTE or above). During the year in which the faculty member will attain eighteen terms of service at .5 FTE or above, a thorough review will be conducted by the department and\/or dean to determine if a recommendation to continue the appointment of the faculty member is to be made to the Provost. (The criteria by which the faculty member will be evaluated should be appropriate for the responsibilities of the position and should be clearly defined at the time of first appointment by the department.) If a recommendation to continue is made and approved by the Provost, the faculty member will be promoted to the rank of Senior Instructor without tenure. If a recommendation is made not to continue the appointment of the faculty member, timely notice of termination will be given and no further appointments will be offered the faculty member.2. Following promotion to Senior Instructor, the faculty member thereafter will be given at least two-year appointments if service is considered fully satisfactory and a suitable position is available (see 3. below).3. Following promotion to Senior Instructor, the faculty member thereafter will be assigned seniority by cumulative years of service at .5 FTE or above as an Instructor and Senior Instructor in the department.The department head is responsible for designating positions that are to be offered at the rank of Instructor or Senior Instructor. Those positions designated at the rank of Senior Instructor will be offered at no less than .5 FTE for each appointment period. When an appointment or appointments are offered by the department, school, or college, the seniority ranking of the Senior Instructors who are qualified for the particular position will determine the order in which they are given the opportunity to accept such appointments. The FTE for positions with the rank of Instructor will be determined for each appointment at the discretion of the department head.4. A faculty member in a non-tenure-related position with the rank of Instructor or Senior Instructor may be a candidate for a tenure-related position for which a national search is conducted.5. A faculty member in a non-tenure-related position with the rank of Instructor or Senior Instructor will be eligible for consideration for sabbatical leave, and will be eligible for leave without pay. A leave taken without pay will not affect the departmental seniority of the Senior Instructor.6. A faculty member in a non-tenured-related position with the rank of Instructor or Senior Instructor will be eligible for salary adjustments at the same time all other faculty members are considered for salary adjustments.Policy on Appointment and Promotion of Instructors and Senior Instructors in Tenure-Related Positions (Effective July 1, 1984)1. Appointment or Promotion to Rank of Senior Instructor Oregon Administrative Rule 580-20-005 (2)(c) states:\"Senior Instructor\": This rank may be used for the appointment or promotion of staff members who have special skills or experience needed in the instructional programs of the institution, but who would not normally be appointed or promoted to professorial ranks. Promotion to the rank of senior instructor will not be made effective before the end of the third year of service. Appointment or promotion to the rank of senior instructor may be made with or without indefinite tenure. Appointment to this rank does not preclude subsequent advancement in rank under appropriate conditions. Because the University of Oregon is dedicated to maintaining its position as a major research as well as an instructional institution, it is expected that the number of faculty members who will be considered for indefinite tenure at the rank of Senior Instructor will be very limited.2. Establishing a Tenure-related Position When an academic department determines that the appointment of a faculty member at the rank of Instructor or Senior Instructor in a tenure- related position would benefit its overall academic program and can be funded within the department's budget, the department head and\/or dean should obtain the approval of the Provost to establish such a position. If approval is given, the department must then conduct a national search to establish an applicant pool from which the selection of the faculty member may be made. Under exceptional conditions, a regional search may be conducted with the approval of the Provost.3. Consideration for Tenure The appointment to a tenure-related position may be made at either the rank of Instructor or Senior Instructor, and consideration for tenure at the rank of Senior Instructor may be given no earlier than three years following the initial appointment, except with the written approval of the Provost.Issued by:\u00a0Vice President for Academic Affairs and ProvostDate:\u00a005\/25\/1984Revision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010\u00a0 Policy number revised from 3.120 to 02.01.01Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It was revised on June 3, 1992, and then again on October 11, 2000. The Organizational Development and Training Steering Committee revised the current policy in 2009 to make it more inclusive of the types of professional development that teaching faculty and research faculty undertake. It also was revised to provide more clear guidelines and delineation of responsibility for professional development and training at the UO.3-19-2012: Addendum A: Guidelines for Administration of Release Time added6-6-2013: Exclusions and Special Situations section updated due to a major change at OUS.Policy:\u00a0Definitions:\u00a0Employees and Supervisors:\u00a0 For purposes of this policy the term \u201cemployees\u201d includes all officers of administration, officers of instruction, officers of research, and classified staff. The term \u201csupervisors\u201d includes all employee\u2019s whose job encompasses supervisory duties, including academic program directors, department heads, and deans.Professional Development and Training: Professional development and training is defined as learning undertaken by employees to maintain and advance their skills, knowledge and competencies, specifically as they relate and add value to the job and workplace. It is a dynamic process and may be achieved not only through participation in formal coursework but also through professional experience, collaboration, mentoring, participation in activities of professional organizations, and independent study and research.Policy Statement:\u00a0The University of Oregon recognizes the importance of encouraging and supporting employees in professional development activities that are related to their employment. It extends to work related professional development opportunities including, but not exclusive to, the sabbatical leave policy, reduced tuition fee rates, eLearning, employee workshops, courses, classes, and professional conferences.Responsibility for professional training and development extends to all levels of the organization:The university is responsible for identifying, creating, and providing opportunities for professional development and training to enhance and build the capacity, skills, excellence, and professionalism of employees to enable them to contribute effectively and creatively to the University\u2019s mission.Supervisors are responsible for assessing and communicating professional development and training needs of individual employees in their direct reporting line, identifying and actively encouraging and supporting appropriate learning experiences. Supervisors have the final approval for funding and providing time for professional development and training opportunities.Individual employees are responsible for assessing their job related skills and knowledge, for maintaining a high level of performance throughout their university employment, and for seeking approval for appropriate professional development and training opportunities in consultation with their supervisors.Professional development and training opportunities should be available to all employees:Supervisors need to plan for and allow appropriate professional development and training activities that occur as part of work time.Professional development and training activities that require time away from the employee\u2019s workplace must be approved by the supervisor.Professional development and training activities outside of and in addition to regular work hours for non-exempt employees require written approval in advance if the activities are to be considered as regular work for overtime compensation.Exclusions and Special Situations:\u00a0OUS Fiscal Policy 70.400 re: Licenses-Occupational-Fee Payment states:\u00a0Each public university (including the Chancellor's Office) within the Oregon University System is responsible for establishing policies and procedures for authorizing and approving reimbursement for occupational licenses, including any related guidelines or other criteria the public university deems appropriate.UO guidelines for these expenditures are available on the Business Affairs website: http:\/\/ba.uoregon.edu\/staff\/business-expense-policies#Licenses_.\u00a0 As currently defined:\u00a0Professional Licenses and CertificationsAs with all university expenditures, payment for a professional license or certification must have a valid, documented business purpose.\u00a0 The VP\/Dean\/Director\/Department Head is best suited to make that determination for his\/her area of responsibility.The professional license or certification must be applicable to the employee\u2019s current position.UO will not pay for a standard Oregon Driver License (Class C).\u00a0 UO will pay for a Class A, B, or C Commercial Driver License if required for the employee\u2019s current position.\u00a0 This requirement must be documented in the employee\u2019s current Position Description.In order to maintain relevance and applicability to university purposes, the time period covered by the professional license or certification should be limited (e.g., one or two years).Payment for the professional license or certification may not be processed from grant\/contract Funds without specific authorization from Sponsored Projects Services.Procedures:\u00a0The responsibility of implementing this policy extends to the following:University leadership and administration (the Executive Leadership Team):\u00a0 University leadership is responsible for identifying and communicating priorities and goals as well as relevant developments and trends affecting the university.Heads of academic and administrative units: Deans, directors, and department heads are responsible for assisting unit heads and supervisors in adopting flexible strategies which promote participation in professional developmental\/training activities.Supervisors:\u00a0 Supervisors are responsible for working with their employees to identify needs and for creating a professional development and training plan that will benefit the unit as well as the individual.Employees:\u00a0 Employees are responsible for engaging in the development of plans in partnership with their supervisor(s), and for participating in the designated learning experiences.Director of UO Organizational Development and Training:\u00a0 Organizational Development and Training in Human Resources is responsible for administering this policy including annual reports.Training and development advisory committees (ODT Steering Committee, CSTDAC, OA Council):\u00a0 The training and development advisory committees are responsible for advocating for their constituent groups in collaboration with the Director of ODT to integrate efforts and optimize resources.While the particular engagement in professional training and development varies widely between groups of employees and also individual employees, the following areas of knowledge and skill development should be considered relevant to the success of university employees and the institution's educational mission and initiatives:1. Learning directly related to optimal job performancea. business skills, including financial stewardship, human resource management and strategic leadership; knowledge of university policies, procedures, mission or governance structures;b. communication skills, including basic skills, conflict management and resolution, negotiation and facilitation;c. team communications and\/or team building skills;d. research funding and grant administration knowledge and skills;e. knowledge and skills related to acting as a member of an ethnically and culturally diverse student body and workforce in an inclusive and respectful manner;f. knowledge and skills in recognizing and responding effectively to discrimination and harassment;g. knowledge and skills in the uses of technology to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the university's business and\/or educational practices.2. Maintaining and developing professional expertiseFunding sources The funding sources for professional development opportunities vary depending on the activity. Funding for sabbatical leaves, for example, is based on the funding source of the employee's payroll in the years preceding the sabbatical and is typically borne by the employing unit. Other UO based professional development and training is offered at no cost to the employing department, where possible. For those professional development and training experiences that do require a fee, the following funding resources are available for consideration by the supervisor and\/or employee.University funding for credit courses:\u00a0 Staff fee privileges (http:\/\/hr.uoregon.edu\/benefits\/staffrates.html) This benefit offers university classes at reduced tuition and is available to eligible employees in positions of half-time or greater (not including temporary classified employees, graduate assistants, and student employees).Department funding:\u00a0 Department funding may be used for the cost of learning experiences, assuming the activity will benefit operational efficiency or effectiveness or is otherwise in line with the guidelines in this policy. Funding is at the discretion of the supervisor and is based on department budget capacity.The Professional Development Opportunity Fund:\u00a0 Employees\/departments may apply for partial funding of learning activities through the Employee Benefit Fund.

The University will provide 100% of OPE for the faculty member's designated annual salary. The faculty member is eligible for this support every sabbatical year.During a non-sabbatical year the University will provide up to 30% of the faculty member's designated annual salary to cover the difference between the salary support awarded by the fellowship and the regular salary. The University will provide 100% of the OPE for the designated annual salary. The faculty member is eligible for this support once between sabbatical years. With the approval of the appropriate dean and department head, this support may be received immediately before or after a sabbatical leave.The University will provide uncompensated salary and OPE according to the terms above when the following conditions are met:The faculty member holds a tenure-related appointment of at least .50 FTEThe fellowship award period is for at least a full academic term.The total salary compensation paid to the faculty member during the period of the fellowship does not exceed the faculty members usual University salary compensation for that period. This does, not preclude proper additional salary as from consulting, summer salary payments, or special overload payments.The fellowship compensation is paid to the faculty member through the University payroll system as salary using an appropriate account to be established for that purpose.The fellowship leave is approved by the faculty member's dean and department head.The fellowship is one that is intended to support the faculty member's activities appropriately related to research, scholarship, or augmentation of teaching expertise, and it is considered by the Provost to be in the best interests of the University that the faculty member accept the fellowship. Examples of fellowships that might be eligible include:Fulbright ScholarJohn Simon Guggenheim Memorial FoundationKellogg FoundationNational Endowment for the Humanities or ArtsThe Provost may make exceptions to this policy when he believes that doing so is in the best interests of the University and the Faculty member requesting an exception.The University's coverage of OPE costs ensures that the faculty member receives continued health insurance and worker's compensation coverage, continues participation in tax-deferred programs and the 6% tenure-reduction program, and receives credit towards accrued sabbatical time and PERS retirement benefits. The faculty member will also continue to have social security contributions withheld from each paycheck.Reviewed and Approved By:\u00a0President's StaffDate:\u00a006\/30\/1993Issued by:\u00a0PresidentRevision History:\u00a002\/08\/2010 Policy number revised from 3.130 to 02.01.09Original Source:\u00a0UO Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Library Fines Appeal Process(1) University Library borrowers who believe they have been assessed in error library fines or charges for lost or damaged materials or that extenuating circumstances warrant reduction or cancellation of the amount billed them by the Library through the Business Office shall first appeal to the classified staff member or Library faculty member in the Library unit where the borrowing transaction originally took place. Student employees are not authorized to handle appeal requests:(a) Any appeal should be made within 30 calendar days of the original billing by the Business Office or of the date of the notice of deduction from the student deposit;(b) The Library shall publish notice of the availability of this appeals process and shall provide copies of such notice at circulation desks and\/or upon request.(2) The following reasons do not constitute legitimate grounds for appeal:(a) Lack of understanding of Library policy;(b) Failure to receive notices mailed by the Library. It is the borrower's responsibility to provide a correct address;(c) Borrower's absence when materials were due or when notices were sent;(d) Materials charged out by one borrower and then lent to another. The borrower whose name appears on the charge card is fully responsible. Borrowing privileges are non-transferable;(e) Accounts referred to a collection agency;(f) Charges incurred over 545 days before the date of appeal.(3) The Library employee shall review with the borrower Library circulation records, explain the questioned transaction referring to applicable Library policies, describe any alleged damage or loss and\/or other evidence leading to the assessment of the fine or charge.(4) If the explanation and review do not satisfy the borrower of the appropriateness of the fine or charges, the borrower may ask to be referred to the appropriate supervisor:(a) Library supervisors are authorized to cancel all or part of any fine or charge; or(b) Library supervisors may determine that the fine or charge was correctly applied.(5) Appeal of a supervisor's decision shall be made by the borrower completing an \"Appeal of Library Charges\" form and returning it within two weeks to the supervisor whose decision is unsatisfactory. Upon receipt of the appeal form, the supervisor shall arrange a mutually convenient appointment for the borrower and the appropriate Library Department Head. The Department Head may, upon reviewing the facts, waive a part or all of the fine or charge or may uphold the billing. The Department Head shall explain the decision to the borrower and record the decision on the appeal form.(6) Department Head's decision may be appealed to the Assistant University Librarian for Public Services within two weeks of the Department Head's decision.

The decision shall be recorded on the appeal form.(7) Assistant University Librarian for Public Services' decisions may be appealed to the University Librarian within two weeks of receipt of the Assistant University Librarian for Public Services' decision. The University Librarian shall make a decision in writing within two weeks of receipt of the appeal:(a) For public borrowers, appeal to the University Librarian shall constitute the end of the available appeals within the University;(b) For members of the University community (faculty, students and staff), appeal to the University Librarian shall be considered as satisfying Step One of the University's grievance procedure outlined in Policy 571.003(B).

For members of the University community (faculty, students and staff), appeal to the University Librarian shall be considered as satisfying Step One of the University's grievance process outlined in Policy 571.003(B). Continuation of the appeal through all the Steps in Policy 571.003(B) shall exhaust University community members' appeals within the University.E.

Such a challenge must have been made and denied in whole or in part (or must not have produced a departmental\/unit response within 20 days after submission) to qualify the debtor for a further hearing in the Office of Business Affairs. If the debtor is eligible for such a hearing, he\/she must request it no later than 60 days after the denial (or non-response) of his\/her challenge at the highest available level of the initiating department or unit or 60 days from the date on the notice provided for in section E(2) of this policy.
