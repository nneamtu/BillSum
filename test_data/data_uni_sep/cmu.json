It also serves as a guide for prospective donors and their advisors, providing assurance that all donors are treated equitably.\n\n\nDefinitions\nn\/a\n\n\nForms \/ Instructions\nn\/a\n\n\nRelated Information\nGift Acceptance, Counting, and Reporting Policy\n\n\nReason for Policy \/ Purpose\nThe purpose of the Real Estate Gift Acceptance Policy is to provide a set of standards by which real estate gifts are reviewed and accepted by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nIntroduction\nA gift of real estate can be a good way for a donor to support Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s education and research mission. The university will make reasonable efforts to accommodate donors who wish to make such gifts.\nFor proffered gifts of real estate, the Executive Director of Gift Planning will work with the donor to investigate the range of potential options for making the gift to help determine which approaches may be in the best interest of both the donor and the university.\nGifts of real estate require careful advance review and planning. All gifts of real estate must be reviewed and approved in accordance with this Real Estate Gift Acceptance Policy and related procedures, which require the donor to provide and the university to obtain detailed and specific information about the real estate. This enables the university to determine the feasibility of accepting the gift.\nIn general, a donor is responsible for all expenses related to protecting his\/her interests in gifts of real estate (such as obtaining a qualified appraisal). The donor is further expected to pay for all expenses associated with the university's due diligence process.\nIn certain cases, the university may elect to bear the cost of conducting the due diligence necessary to accept a gift of real estate. In order to do so, the dean or officer who oversees the college or unit benefitting from the gift must request approval from the Vice President for University Advancement, including a rationale for why incurring such expenses is in the best interest of the university, and identifying which institutional funds will be used to pay such expenses. Proceeds from the sale of a gift of real estate may be used to reimburse due diligence expenses incurred by the college or unit receiving the gift, provided that there is no gift agreement term precluding this.\nA gift of real estate may be declined by the university if it is deemed unfeasible. Feasibility will be determined through the university's due diligence and review process and will be at the sole discretion of the university. The university may deem a potential gift of real estate unfeasible as a result of a number of factors the university must consider, including, but not limited to:\nForeign ownership laws\nEstimated costs to evaluate and accept the real estate (exceeds a net value threshold)\nEnvironmental or other liabilities\nCondition of real estate\nEstimated carrying costs for the real estate (exceeds net value threshold)\nLack of marketability of the real estate\nLow valuation of the real estate\nTainted property\nConflict of interest\n\n\nReal Estate Gift Review Committee\nThe Real Estate Gift Review Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d), composed of the following members, will make final decisions on the acceptance of gifts of real estate.\nVice President for University Advancement (chair)\nVice President of Operations\nVice President and General Counsel\n\nThe Committee shall consult with appropriate colleagues in the divisions of University Advancement, Finance, General Counsel, and Operations in the execution of its responsibilities under this Policy.\nThe Executive Director of Gift Planning shall serve as the staff contact for the Committee.\n\nPreliminary Due Diligence Process for Gift Acceptance\nThe university gift officer working with the donor shall provide the Executive Director of Gift Planning with information about the proposed real estate gift, including:\nOwner\u2019s name\nAddress of the property\nPhotographs of the property (if available)\nRecent appraisal (if available) or approximate value of the property using credible resources such as local real estate agent estimates or research tools\nDetails of the proposed gift, for example:\nProposed timing of the donation\nWhether the university is expected to assume any mortgages or tenant leases\nWhether the donor is willing to pay for all expenses associated with the university\u2019s due diligence process\nEstimated costs of the transfer, including which costs the donor may be willing to pay (e.g., realty transfer, deed preparation, or similar settlement costs)\nGift purpose, and whether the proceeds of the transaction will be used directly by the university or used in return for a life income gift arrangement\n\nPrincipal uses of the property by donor and related occupancy information (e.g., any tenants)\nProperty zoning (e.g., commercial, residential, industrial, or agricultural)\nSurvey of the property (if available)\nCopy of the owner\u2019s deed to the property (and proposed deed from the donor to the university, if available)\nAny known liens or encumbrances (e.g., mortgages or easements)\nCopies of property tax statements and insurance information (if available)\nCopies of any tenant leases\nIf a commercial property, any operating statements and estimates of carrying costs\nAny other information available regarding the property\n\nIf the gift is associated with an oil and gas lease, the gift officer shall provide the Executive Director of Gift Planning with information about the proposed lease, including:\nGeneral terms of lease offer, including represented party\nLegal description of the property under consideration\nPlat\/tract map of the property\nGift deed, mineral deed, executor\u2019s deed, etc.\nMineral owner\u2019s report\n\nThe Executive Director of Gift Planning will forward all information to the university office responsible for real estate, which shall then obtain additional information as needed, including but not limited to:\nCurrent real estate property assessment\nZoning of the property\nFair market value opinion\nHistorical operating expense statements\nLease or other contracts related to commercial properties\nAnticipated expenses of the transaction, including any donor concessions or gifts to offset university costs\n\nThe Executive Director of Gift Planning will, in conjunction with the university office responsible for real estate, present preliminary real estate gift information to the Committee. The Committee shall either decline the gift or provide preliminary approval to continue to investigate the feasibility of the gift through additional required due diligence, including but not limited to:\nTitle search\nSurvey\nEnvironmental testing\nIndependent appraisal\nThird-party consultants advising on local laws and regulations\nRequest for further communication with the donor regarding assistance with expenses associated with the proposed gift\n\nPreliminary approval by the Committee does not constitute final gift acceptance until all conditions have been met.\n\nGifts of Real Property with a Retained Life Interest\nA gift of real property with a retained life interest is a full transfer of the title of a personal residence or farm to the university, with the donor or other person(s) retaining use of the property for a term of years or for the life or lives of the donor and\/or other person(s).\nSuch gifts are subject both to the general conditions and to the guidelines for acceptance of outright gifts of real estate as set forth in this Policy. The agreement creating the life interest must provide, at a minimum, that the donor and\/or life tenant will remain responsible for the payment of mortgages, taxes, insurance (property insurance with university as loss payee; general liability insurance with the university as additional insured; and other appropriate insurance as determined by the university); utilities; maintenance, repairs, and general upkeep; and all other costs associated with the property, unless other specific provisions are made for the payment of these expenses.\nPeriodic proof of payment for applicable items and certificates of insurance may be required by the university from time to time.\n\nGifts of Real Estate in New Jurisdictions\nThere are many important factors to consider when the university evaluates a potential gift of real estate in a jurisdiction in which the university currently has no place of business. The university\u2019s divisions of Finance and General Counsel will assist the university office responsible for real estate and the Executive Director of Gift Planning in identifying compliance issues and coordinating resolution with the appropriate internal departments.\nThe university will often need to devote internal resources and\/or engage outside consultants to assist the university in evaluating the laws, regulations, and requirements of the new jurisdiction. In addition to professional service fees for the evaluation, there may be additional costs to the university to maintain ongoing compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and requirements of the jurisdiction. Such fees and acquisition of additional resources should only be considered subsequent to receiving preliminary approval for the gift.\n\nFinal Approval\/Acceptance Conditions\nFollowing preliminary approval, the Executive Director of Gift Planning shall prepare a written summary of the gift proposal, in conjunction with the university office responsible for real estate, and submit it to the Committee. Among other relevant information, the summary will include:\nDescription of the real property\nPurpose of the gift\nAppraisal of the property, which shall include the value of the university\u2019s prospective interest in the property and its marketability\nAny potential for income, and an estimate of the expenses, liabilities, and carrying costs prior to disposition (and the related financial plan to cover any expenses, liabilities, and carrying costs in excess of income prior to disposition)\nAny environmental risks or problems revealed by audit or survey\nAny potential university use\nAny special arrangements requested by the donor concerning disposition (e.g., price considerations, time duration prior to disposition, potential buyers, Realtors or brokers with whom the donor would like the university to list the property, etc.)\nDisclosure of the existence of any and all mortgages, deeds of trust, restrictions, reservations, easements, mechanic liens, and other limitations of record\nTax consequences of ownership\nThe operational plan to manage the property until it is sold (e.g., inspections to evaluate the condition of the property, making any required or routine repairs, managing any tenants)\nThe proposed sales plan, if any\nA draft of a negotiated gift agreement that will address relevant matters relating to the donation of the real estate, such as the purpose of the gift; form of the related real estate title transfer document (gift deed); timing of the transfer of the property; party responsible for payment of various title transfer costs; liabilities that the donor will retain and\/or the university will assume in connection with the property; and similar matters. The mutually agreed gift agreement, once executed by the parties, will govern the terms of the donor\u2019s donation of the real estate to the university.\n\nThe Committee will then accept or decline the proposed gift of real estate. Any such acceptance shall be subject to such conditions or requirements that the Committee determines.\n\nPost-approval\nUpon the Committee\u2019s approval, the Executive Director of Gift Planning will work directly with the donor to execute all necessary documents to complete the transaction.\nIn general:\nReal estate gifts will be deeded directly to Carnegie Mellon University\nTitle transfer (deed) and related documents are maintained by (and should be forwarded to) the university office responsible for real estate\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

General questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684. For specific questions regarding certification, contact the Intercultural Communication Center, ext. 8-4979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of How the Carnegie Mellon Policy Satisfies the Pennsylvania English Fluency in Higher Education Act\n\nThe Pennsylvania English Fluency in Higher Education Act requires the University to file annually with the Pennsylvania Department of Education a certification stating that its instructional personnel are fluent in the English language. All instructional personnel, both native and nonnative speakers of English who teach undergraduate students, must be included in CMU's annual certification process.\nFaculty members who are native speakers of English and who teach undergraduates will be certified by their departments on the basis of conversations with the dean, department head or specified designee. Departments cannot assume that someone is a native speaker without talking with him or her.\nThe fluency of non-native English speaking faculty members will be evaluated through two interviews: one with the dean, department head or specified designee, and the second with a senior faculty member. All interviewers must be native speakers of English.\nTA English fluency -- both graduate and undergraduate -- is managed through the International Teaching Assistant testing process administered by CMU's Intercultural Communication Center.\n\n(Note: CMU policy requires the International Teaching Assistant Test for TAs of both graduate as well as undergraduate classes.)\n\nConsistent with Pennsylvania law, CMU allows for the following exemptions from certification: 1) visiting faculty, 2) faculty who will teach courses taught predominantly in a foreign language, 3) faculty who do not teach undergraduate students, and 4) faculty who work one-on-one with students.\n\n(Note: CMU requires TAs to take the ITA for any job that requires student interaction.)\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Carnegie Mellon views AIDS as it does any other chronic illness and therefore does not approve of and will take action against cases of discrimination or harassment based on a person's actual or suspected Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status. Carnegie Mellon will exercise full, reasonable care to protect the health and safety of faculty, staff and students and will offer ongoing education and support services as part of this commitment. This policy is consistent with and acts in conjunction with applicable federal, state and local laws, including ADA and OSHA standards, as well as university policies relating to harassment, discrimination, workplace accommodation and related university services. It may be revised as more facts about the disease are learned.\nReason for the Policy\nThis policy was developed to make known the university's position on treatment of actual AIDS occurrences and related issues within the Carnegie Mellon environment and to address the needs of afflicted individuals. Current medical knowledge indicates that those individuals infected with HIV pose no threat to other students or employees in an academic setting because the virus is not transmitted through casual contact; it is transmitted only through the exchange of certain bodily fluids. The university is committed to an education campaign designed to influence behaviors of individuals, whether infected or not, especially relating to safety in the workplace and safer sexual practices, including the use of condoms, in order to limit spread of the virus.\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control have repeatedly affirmed that there is no recognized risk of infection created by casual kissing, contact with skin not contaminated with blood, or living in the same house as, eating food handled by, being coughed or sneezed upon by, or swimming in a pool with, an infected person. These facts, derived from the best epidemiological data available, serve in concert as the basis for this policy.\nDefinition of Terms\nCarnegie Mellon adopts the following AIDS-related medical definitions:\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a serious, progressive illness caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which reduces the immune system's capability to fight disease and allows for infection by a variety of serious opportunistic diseases. At the present time, there is no known cure, vaccine or fully satisfactory treatment for AIDS.\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. It is possible to carry the virus for many years without noticing symptoms. Transmission of the virus occurs through intimate sexual contact with an infected individual, the sharing of needles, exposure to contaminated blood and blood products, and from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy or birth.\nPenalty for Violation\nAny faculty, staff or student found to have violated the university's policy on AIDS, or found guilty of discriminating or harassing an individual afflicted with AIDS, as determined by the appropriate decision-making body, will be subject to existing disciplinary mechanisms and procedures, including possible suspension, termination or expulsion. Any faculty, staff or student with HIV infection who believes that he\/she is being discriminated against or harassed, knows or suspects the occurrence of AIDS discrimination or harassment, or desires counseling for coping with potential harassment, is strongly urged and encouraged to immediately contact one of the persons listed in the Contacts section at the end of this policy.\nEducational Awareness\nAn educational program is central to addressing HIV infection on the Carnegie Mellon campus. Increased awareness and education not only help prevent further spread of the virus, but also reduce the potential for various forms of discrimination against individuals infected with HIV by providing factual information to dispel unwarranted fears.\nThe university will continue to offer comprehensive educational programs about HIV infection and AIDS that address the needs of both infected and noninfected individuals. Such programs will include information on the nature of the disease and transmission factors, the proper use of condoms, testing and treatment options, and legal rights and responsibilities. Effective educational programs will require substantial outreach regularly. Updated informational materials will be available at the Student Health Services office, residence halls and other designated areas on campus.\nHealth Services\nIn support of offering factual information on the disease, Student Health Services will offer medical care, counseling, referrals, risk assessment, education on safer sex practices, and HIV pre-test and post-test counseling to all students upon request. Initial phone contact may be made anonymously until the caller is comfortable with the ramifications of revealing his\/her identity.\nThe university expects that its employees will independently seek appropriate health care through their off-campus providers. However, Student Health Services will provide referrals to any individual upon request.\nHIV Testing\nCarnegie Mellon will not conduct a mandatory screening program to determine the HIV status of faculty, staff or students. However, Student Health Services will be familiar with testing sites and will make referrals. Pre-test and post-test counseling will be available at the Student Health Services office for students only; employees will be referred to local testing programs. Employees may also contact the university's Employee Assistance Program for confidential counseling.\nConfidentiality\nThe university will comply with federal and state laws, regulations and policies that protect the confidentiality of medical and educational records and with the disease reporting requirements of the Allegheny County Health Department and Pennsylvania Department of Health. Student Health Services will not release medical information of any kind to any person, group, agency, parent, family member, insurer, employer or institution without the prior, specific, written informed consent of the individual involved unless required by law or court order. No faculty or staff member will enter information that a student or employee has AIDS into non-medical, employment or education records without the knowledge and consent of the student or employee involved.\nAdministrators of the Student Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, Housing Office, Department of Human Resources and Division of Student Affairs must make all personnel aware of the need to protect confidential information. Each unit will have procedures in place for the maintenance of secure confidential records. Any purposeful or accidental breach of the security of confidential information on the part of unit personnel will be met by prompt, effective action in accordance with university personnel policies.\nImpact on Students\nAdmissions - The university will not discriminate in accepting and\/or enrolling applicants on the basis of actual or suspected AIDS status, or require any applicant to take an HIV test or provide any information concerning AIDS for the purposes of acceptance, enrollment or continuing enrollment.\nClassroom - Reasonable accommodations for students with AIDS will be provided consistent with the university's policy on making reasonable accommodations for any student's medical condition.\nHousing - The Housing Office will not discriminate in any services provided, including room assignments. The Housing Office will take all reasonable measures to ensure the safety and comfort of all members of the housing community, including those who are HIV positive.\nImpact on Employees\nCasual contact with persons who have HIV infection does not place co-workers at risk for the illness. Therefore, in compliance with current federal and state laws, the university will not prevent an employee with HIV infection from continuing in the workplace, so long as the employee can physically and mentally meet existing performance standards.\nConsistent with current law, Carnegie Mellon will not ask employment applicants if they are HIV positive, make a hiring decision based on the suspicion that a person has AIDS, or require anyone to test for HIV antibody status as a condition of employment.\nReporting AIDS Status\nIf an individual discloses the illness to a supervisor or department head, the supervisor or department head should, without revealing the individual's identity, contact the assistant vice president for human resources to obtain information on support and accommodations the university can provide to that individual.\nIn all cases of illness or disability, including AIDS, the university will not request or require a diagnosis of illness, except as required for evaluating work accommodation requests or processing disability claims. The faculty or staff member may be asked to provide physician certification about his\/her ability to work, work limitations, and\/or length of convalescence. In the event the employee is not able to continue working, he\/she is eligible to use Paid Time Off and\/or short-term disability and long-term disability, as provided by current university policy.\nTo protect the health of employees identifying their HIV status, the assistant vice president for human resources, in appropriate consultation with the chairman or department head, director of environmental health and safety, and director of student health services, should notify the supervisor if the work environment is believed to be one with greater than normal risk of exposure to infectious agents, and advise appropriate actions, if any, to be taken. Any employee identifying his\/her HIV status and holding a position which might involve a high risk of contamination of infectious diseases will be educated to take the precautions necessary to ensure his\/her own health.\nImpact on Internationals\nThe university will provide equal access to information, counseling and health services for faculty, staff and students who are not United States citizens in a confidential manner. Available information includes current United States laws and regulations with respect to non-citizens and AIDS, particularly in matters relating to visas, work permits, and the ability to enter, remain and work in the country. University personnel responsible for providing information and counseling about the legal and medical aspects of AIDS are to ensure that cultural and language barriers do not prevent the clear communication of facts.\nAdministrative Review\nThe dean of student affairs, assistant vice president for human resources and director of student health services, in consultation with the AIDS Policy Committee, will work with medical authorities to remain current on AIDS information and will arrange for periodic review of this policy. In addition, this group will periodically meet to discuss the efficacy of the policy and its implementation, and suggest amendments to the policy, as appropriate.

The most recent revision was approved by the President's Council on March 27, 2012.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Vice Provost for Research. Questions on policy content should be directed to the assistant vice provost for research compliance, 412-268-4724.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\nConsulting Policy Compliance with Financial Conflicts of Interest Requirements in Research\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement \nThe university's principal missions are the education of students and the generation and dissemination of knowledge. In pursuit of these missions, or as a natural outgrowth of such activities, faculty and staff often become involved in outside activities. While extramural activities benefit the university and are generally encouraged, in some circumstances such activities give rise to conflicts of interest or commitment.\nThis policy addresses the circumstances in which conflicts of interest or commitment may occur, provides examples of the principles and processes outlined in this policy, and specifies a process for resolving potential conflicts. As used in this policy, the term \"university members\" means faculty (including instructors and special faculty appointments), staff (any employee of the university) and visiting faculty and staff.\nUniversity members should use good judgment, professional commitment and ethics to protect themselves and the university from potential conflicts. Administrators and supervisors should make employees aware of this policy and create, by example, an atmosphere consistent with the university's missions.\nIn addition to the guidelines and processes described below, some funding agencies of the federal government require grantees to conform with other disclosure and conflict of interest resolution procedures. Refer to the related policy Compliance with Financial Conflicts of Interest Requirements in Research for guidance on addressing conflicts of interest related to university funded research.\nConflicts of Interest and Commitment\nConflicts of interest occur when university members are in a position to influence a decision on policy or purchases where they might directly or indirectly receive financial benefit or give improper advantage to associates. Conflicts of commitment arise when university members' involvements in outside activities substantially interfere with their primary commitments to the university: to teach, to conduct research and to meet related obligations to students, colleagues and the university.\nStatement of Principles\n\nAll university members should make the fulfillment of their responsibilities to the university the focal point of their professional activities. University members should only become involved in extramural professional activities insofar as they advance the mission or prestige of the university and the activities do not interfere with their responsibilities to the university. However, this policy is not intended to unduly restrict involvement in outside activities.\nUniversity members are traditionally allowed wide latitude in defining their professional agenda and their degree of involvement in outside activities. This tradition has served the university well. In many circumstances, involvement in outside activities promotes the university's missions and prestige. Consequently, the purpose of this policy is to offer overall guidelines, and not a list of particulars, for arranging outside activities and to provide a mechanism for resolving potential conflicts of interest or commitment.\n\nGuidelines\nThe following guidelines are not inclusive and are not without exceptions. They provide examples of potential conflicts and processes for resolving them.\n\nUniversity members in a position to influence a university business decision for which they might receive material benefit should disclose the nature of the conflict to others involved in the decision. Whenever possible, those with potential conflicts should remove themselves from involvement in the decision. If the individuals should continue to participate in the decision process, discussion with supervisors and documentation of the potential conflict should be presented to the appropriate dean or department head.\nUniversity members are regularly involved in consulting activities from which they profit financially. As a rule, such activities are not a conflict as long as:\n\ni) University resources (laboratories, studios, equipment, computational facilities and\/or human resources) are not more than incidentally used without reimbursing the university.\nii) Such activities do not unduly interfere with the time and energy committed by the individuals to their primary responsibilities to the university. The allowable amount of time dedicated to consulting will be governed by the Consulting Policy. University members should adhere to the understood maximum of one day per week.\niii) Such involvement does not inhibit the publication of research findings developed in the course of the individual's regular university activities.\n\n\nThe university actively encourages involvement in professional organizations, panels, advisory commissions, and government, charitable and community organizations. However, such involvement should not become so dominant that university members no longer effectively satisfy their responsibilities to the university. The counsel of colleagues should be regarded as a valuable source of detached perspective on such conflicts of commitment.\nUniversity members should not engage in direct competition with the university either personally or through a firm in which they have a substantial interest. For example, such a circumstance may arise when an individual solicits a research award for which the university is a competitor or would have been a competitor had the individual properly acted as an agent of the university. In order to avoid such potential conflicts, the individual should consult the appropriate dean or department head.\nBefore contemplating outside employment or consulting activities, university members should disclose to the appropriate dean or department head potential conflicts of commitment or interest.\nFaculty members must exercise prudence in directing students and supervised employees toward activities from which the faculty might financially benefit. The potential conflict is obvious, and faculty are encouraged to consult their dean, department head or colleagues for an independent evaluation of the activities' educational merits.\nGraduate students should be discouraged from consulting, especially as this distracts from their educational goals. In particular, there is great potential for conflict of interest when graduate students consult for spinoff companies; in this case, prior approval of the department head must be obtained.\nUniversity members should not undertake or orient university research at the expense of fulfilling the mission of the university to serve the needs of an outside organization.\nUniversity members cannot withhold from the sponsoring organization(s) for personal benefit any information that they have acquired in connection with their sponsored research.\n\nProcedures for Resolving Potential Conflicts\nThe first and most important line of defense against conflicts of interest or commitment must be the university members themselves. Installation of a quasi-judicial system for monitoring and adjudicating potential conflicts will not serve the larger interests of the university. The university, therefore, strongly encourages university members to disclose to the appropriate dean or department head their outside commitments on a regular basis (e.g., during annual departmental reviews, evaluations, or whenever those commitments undergo significant change). In the event that potential conflicts cannot be resolved at this level, they should be referred to the President\u2019s Office.\nConflicts of interest related to research should be addressed in the manner outlined in the related policy Compliance with Financial Conflict of Interest Requirements in Research.\nSummary\nThe university actively encourages an open academic environment where teaching, conducting research and disseminating knowledge are the principal goals of the institution. To further these missions, the university has relied and shall continue to rely on the good judgment, professional commitment and moral ethics of the university members to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes objectivity, fairness and appropriate use of resources.\u00a0\n   \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the University Registrar, 412-268-7404.\n\n\nDATE OF ISSUANCE:\nAdopted August 1, 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nNo undergraduate classes, exams, academic, or artistic activities (including: extra help session, rehearsals, ROTC drill, make-up exams, etc.) are scheduled on weekdays between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Extra class time beyond those regularly scheduled must take place either before 4:30 p.m. or after 6:30 p.m.\nUndergraduate Course Meeting Procedure\nThis policy is not intended to reduce the rigor or vigor of the academic or artistic programs, but to ensure that students have a period in which they are free to carry on co-curricular activities and athletics. Scheduling classes, exams, or other academic and artistic activities makes it very difficult for the students to meet these commitments. Since we are all concerned about the quality of life at the university, this time must be held for the students.\nIn planning the academic course schedule, the University Registrar's Office will review all courses to ensure that no academic or artistic courses be scheduled in this period. In addition, any requests to schedule additional or makeup course meetings, review and\/or study sessions, teaching assistant office hours, or other course-related meetings, must take place either before 4:30 p.m. or after 6:30 p.m. This includes meetings in all university spaces, not just within University Registrar's Office-controlled classrooms.\nAs with any policy, there must be a means of making exceptions. Any academic or artistic activities which you feel must be scheduled between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. must be cleared with the University Registrar. These requests must be in writing either as a memo or through email. All requests must include the course relationship, intent for the requested meeting, and the reason why the meeting cannot be held either before 4:30 p.m. or after 6:30 p.m.\nAny further clarification of this policy can be addressed to the Associate Vice President and Director of Enrollment Services.\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the vice provost for education, 8-5865.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreamble\nThe Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of examinations for the undergraduate courses (defined as courses that are numbered 6xx or below). These policies represent an understanding between faculty and student concerning an important but often stressful period, especially at the conclusion of each academic semester and at mid-semester. There should be no expectation that the following points will cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the exam schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period, preferably as part of the course syllabus.\nIn order to help students plan their time and study optimally for examinations, this document lays out in some detail the policies regarding final and in-term examinations. Instructors are requested to provide notification of the major in-term examinations in the course syllabus. The final examination date is posted early in the semester. It is the responsibility of the student to give his or her instructor sufficient notice and to work with the instructor to re-schedule examinations if this is needed.\nDefinitions\n\nFinal examination period. The university's official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s).\nScheduled final examinations. Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by the University Registrar's Office.\nSelf-scheduled examinations. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self-scheduled examinations.\nFinal examinations. Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part of the course.\nIn-term examinations. Major examinations during the semester are referred to here as in-term examinations.\n\nPolicies\nI. In-term Examinations\n\nAll in-term examinations should be given during the regularly scheduled class time. However, if the exam requires additional time to complete, then examinations may be administered outside of regularly scheduled class time.\nNo examinations given outside of class time (excluding make ups and self-scheduled examinations) shall be administered on a Friday after 4:30 pm, or at any time Saturday or Sunday.\nThe instructor administering an exam (or another required class event) that falls outside class time must make any and all reasonable accommodations to provide an alternative time to students who have conflicts with the proposed time period, including those conflicts due to activities, meetings, other classes, etc. (provided that the instructor is notified of such conflict in a timely manner).\nNo student shall be required to take more than two full-period in-class or out-of-class examinations on the same day. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor in a timely manner of his\/her circumstance so that appropriate accommodations can be made.\n\nII. Final Examinations\n\nAll scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examination period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to take a self-scheduled examination during this time. Non-comprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination.\nInstructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than the last regular day of classes in courses for which there is a final examination. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned.\nNo other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final examination period unless it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final examination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the course, no classes other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. Review sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort should be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In appreciation of the time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio reviews, critiques or juries shall be scheduled for the last class day of a course with a final examination.\nInstructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave earlier nor pressure students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examinations.\nNo student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 25-hour period. A student who has more than two examinations scheduled within a 25-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should first contact the instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the problem cannot be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate dean of his or her home college.\nTake-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the student's choosing during the final examination period.\nStudents are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the examination; late arrival will reduce the total time a student has to complete the examination, unless instructor's course policy indicates otherwise. Instructors reserve the right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who miss an examination with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make-up final examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to include late arrival policy and make-up exam policy in the course syllabus.\nAny student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final examination in the presence of an instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy arising from this review shall be dealt with in accordance with the university procedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination that is not returned to a student will be kept available for a year for review. In the event that the instructor or teaching assistant is not available for the review, the responsibility shall rest with the department head of the instructor offering the course or his or her designee. Since instructors are expected to return all work assigned before the final examinations, they are not responsible for retaining unclaimed coursework.\nConcerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final examination policy or alterations of the final examination schedule should be directed to the department head of the instructor offering the course or to the associate dean of the student's home college.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It was most recently revised on September 8, 1998.\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nOffice of the Provost. Questions about policy content should be directed to the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn emeritus faculty member, whether employed by the university or not, is granted a number of privileges, services and benefits.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\n\n\nPolicy to Provide Retirement Options for Tenured Faculty\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nA retired faculty member on whom the university has conferred the designation of professor, associate professor, associate research professor, research professor, associate teaching professor, or teaching professor, emeritus or emerita (all referred to herein as emeritus faculty) continues to be a member of the university community, whether employed by the university or not, and is granted by this policy a number of privileges, services and benefits, as enumerated below.\nTenured faculty should also refer to the university's Policy to Provide Retirement Options for Tenured Faculty.\nFinancial and Retirement Planning\nThe university will make available to faculty and their spouses programs and materials relevant to financial and retirement planning. The university will designate a person within Human Resources who will be a readily accessible contact for assistance to prospective retiring faculty members in getting information on health care (including Medicare), Social Security, pension elections and other matters related to retirement. Materials available should include a compendium of the provisions of the various benefit plans that pertain to retirement, booklets issued by various government agencies on topics such as Medicare and Social Security, and informational materials prepared by organizations such as the AARP.\nIn addition, programs and materials will be provided by outside organizations and professionals, such as TIAA\/CREF and Vanguard, rather than by the university itself, but at no cost to the faculty members. These programs will include the opportunity to meet individually or in groups to discuss aspects of financial and retirement planning.\nIt is understood that assistance with financial planning under this policy will not encompass such arrangements or advice as would cast the university in the role of a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to investment advice.\nEmeritus Status\nEmeritus faculty are encouraged to continue playing an active role in their academic discipline, in their department and in the intellectual life of the university generally. To foster this continued role and an on-going relationship with Carnegie Mellon University:\n\nEmeritus faculty continue to be members of their academic departments and will be listed as such in the university catalogues, the Faculty\/Staff Directory, etc. They continue having the right to attend and participate in department and university faculty meetings and other activities as before retirement, but without the right to vote.\nEmeritus faculty members shall be retained on all mailing lists that contain information of general interest to faculty members, unless they specifically request that their name be omitted from such lists. They will be retained on invitation lists for faculty social functions to which non-retired faculty of equivalent rank are invited, and invited to become, or continue being, members of the Faculty Club. Likewise, they shall continue to have faculty privileges at the university bookstore, art store and computer store, and access to the same recreational and dining facilities that they could use before retirement.\nReasonable office space shall be assured to emeritus faculty who need it. While this space may be shared, it should be a genuine office.\nAn emeritus faculty member can serve as the principal investigator on grants and can supervise doctoral students with approval from the respective department head.\nEmeritus faculty shall have access to electronic mail and networking through the university's Computing Services, as do other faculty. Likewise, they shall retain full access to library facilities, including borrowing rights and interlibrary loan privileges.\nEmeritus faculty shall continue to have the same access to parking as before retirement, and will retain their seniority in space allocation. For emeriti who are not employed by the university, free parking of up to 50 days is granted in one of the university areas; additional parking can be purchased by the emeriti at half the regular rate.\n\nThe above is not meant to preclude the availability of other university services or resources where arrangements have been made with the respective department and dean.\nBenefits\nEmeritus faculty are entitled to all benefits the university grants to retired faculty members, in particular, eligibility for the university tuition remission and grant program and medical insurance benefits. These benefits are detailed in the Carnegie Mellon University Benefit Plan for full-time faculty.\nExceptions\nWhen an emeritus faculty member is employed by the university, the provisions of the appointment shall prevail, but they shall not deprive the appointee of any of the entitlements specified under the previous paragraphs.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on general Policy content should be directed to the University Registrar\u2019s Office, 412-268-8250.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nStudents will complete all requirements for the master\u2019s degree within a maximum of seven years from original matriculation as a master\u2019s student, or less if required by a more restrictive department, school or college policy.\u00a0 Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a master\u2019s degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered master\u2019s degree program under criteria determined by that program.  Under extenuating circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a college\/school may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students who are pursuing the master\u2019s degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Introduction\n\nThis manual sets forth policies and procedures for Carnegie Mellon University with regard to:\n\nProperty owned by Carnegie Mellon;\nProperty acquired by Carnegie Mellon and funded under a sponsored research grant or contract;\nProperty furnished by the U.S. Government (Government) or other sponsors and being used as part of a research grant or contract with Carnegie Mellon; and\nProperty owned by other parties (vendors, faculty, staff, agencies, etc.) but being used in a facility owned or leased by Carnegie Mellon.\n\nA. Responsibilities of Property Accounting\nCarnegie Mellon's Property Accounting Department (Property Accounting) has developed a property management system which provides for assurance of valid data, user support and complete audit trails for inspection by internal departments and external agencies. Property Accounting also has established the policies and procedures incorporated into this manual to control, protect, preserve and maintain all property for which Carnegie Mellon has responsibility. These policies and procedures comply with all applicable government regulations, including United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-21 \"Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,\" A-110 \"Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,\" and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Carnegie Mellon's centralized property management system includes:\n\nReviewing all related accounting data submitted in support of property acquisitions. This includes screening certain movable assets owned or controlled by Carnegie Mellon to certify that those assets to be purchased using government funds are not currently available for transfer or shared use.\nMaintaining a record for each capitalized item in the Property Accounting Services (PAS) database. These records in aggregate support the net book value of property recorded in the General Ledger. A monthly reconciliation is made between the PAS and the General Ledger for all additions, changes and disposals.\nVerifying the correctness of PAS records by conducting physical inventories at intervals of not less than once every 24 months, to insure that the items exist and are usable, used and needed.\nProcedures for recycling or disposing of movable assets to insure that:\n\nproper control over physical disposition is maintained, and\nadequate supporting records are kept to document a sale, trade-in or other disposition.\n\n\n\nB. Responsibilities of Department Property Officers\nEach department is directly responsible for the control, use and security of capital movable and fixed assets in its possession. In accordance with this responsibility, each department is to have a formally appointed Property Officer to provide the main line of communication between the department and Property Accounting. The Department Property Officer and others who are directly involved in equipment purchasing and inventories should be familiar with the university policies and procedures as contained in this manual.\nThe Department Property Officer should be a business manager or staff assistant who reports directly to the department head. Responsibilities of the Department Property Officer include the following:\n\nEnforce compliance within the department with the university policies and procedures as contained in this manual.\nAssist Property Accounting in locating new equipment which requires tagging.\nRecord the movement and disposal of equipment on the forms provided by Property Accounting, and advise Property Accounting regarding such changes.\nAssign or schedule responsible department personnel to assist with physical inventories.\nInform Property Accounting of any space adjustments in the Department Property Officer's areas.\n\nC. Insurance Information\nProperty is covered by the university's all risk insurance policy, with a $100,000 deductible applicable to each loss. The university has established an internal insurance pool for movable asset losses which are less than $25,000. The annual charge for each department to participate in the pool is based on the total original cost of the department's movable assets in the Property Accounting Services each year as of April 30th. If a single piece of equipment has a cost greater than $25,000.00, only the first $25,000.00 is included in the pool cost calculation. The charge is assessed at the beginning of the following fiscal year and covers all movable assets acquired during that fiscal year provided that Property Accounting has the required information to enter the assets into its system. This includes any items obtained without any General Ledger entries being involved, such as donated items or items on loan. For these, it is the department's responsibility to promptly notify Property Accounting in writing. Exhibit A, Donated Item Receiving Report, is to be used for donated items. Exhibit B, Non-Carnegie Mellon Movable Equipment\/Furniture, is to be used for items on loan.The conditions under which a claim will be paid are as follows:\n\nTheft loss has been reported immediately to Security.\nEach loss is subject to a $250.00 deductible unless the equipment is protected by an electronic security system.\n\nConditions under which claims will not be paid:\n\nThefts from unlocked rooms and other unsecured areas such as hallways, loading docks, etc.\nThefts of donated or loaned equipment which has not been promptly reported to Property Accounting upon receipt.\nThefts of equipment from off-campus locations if Property Accounting has not received prior notification that the item has been properly authorized for off-campus use.\n\nThe Office of Risk Management should be contacted for any further details pertaining to insurance.\n\nII.  Capitalization Policy\n\nA. Movable Assets\n\nIndividual items of furniture or equipment, with an original cost of $5,000.00 or more and a minimum useful life of 2 years, are capitalized and charged to the appropriate movable asset account number (see Exhibit C - General Ledger Account Numbers). Original cost includes the cost of the item, less any applicable discounts, plus any delivery charges and cost of installation. All of these costs are recorded as having been incurred on the asset's acquisition date. The cost also includes any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus (accessories) which are acquired with the item and are necessary to make the item usable for its acquired purpose. Such accessories acquired after the capitalized item and with costs less than $5,000.00 are not capitalized and are charged to non-capital account number 8905.\nThe acquisition document for an accessory with an original cost of $5,000.00 or more, which is to be inserted into an existing movable asset, must state the Carnegie Mellon asset number or original purchase order number for the existing movable asset. If this information is not provided, the accessory will not be capitalized regardless of its value.\nEquipment fabricated at Carnegie Mellon by Carnegie Mellon University personnel is capitalized if it meets Carnegie Mellon's capitalization requirements. The following procedures are applicable:\nDepartments are to use Exhibit D, Request for New Center or Account Number, to request a fabrication or project account number. Include the title, begin and estimated end dates, center(s) involved, separate dollar totals budgeted for labor (fabrications only), supplies and capital equipment to be charged to the fabrication project account, as well as appropriate authorized signature(s). Send Exhibit D to Property Accounting.\nProperty Accounting will assign a fabrication (project) account number and an asset number tag after obtaining the written approval (where applicable) of the Office of Sponsored Research (centers 1-4XXXX and 1-5XXXX) on Exhibit D. Where applicable, the Office of Sponsored Research will contact the requesting department if a fabrication account number is not approved.\nProperty Accounting will send a copy of Exhibit D to the requesting department, the Office of Sponsored Research (where applicable), and Accounting. Property Accounting (and the Office of Sponsored Research, where applicable) will monitor the activity in the fabrication (project) account and investigate deviations from the information provided on Exhibit D.\nAll items acquired, as well as all labor involved in the fabrication (project), are charged to the fabrication (project) account number by the department. If any capital equipment items are included, they are to be clearly identified as such on the purchase orders, bills of sale, or journal entries. For those capital equipment items, Property Accounting will assign individual asset number tags.\nFor a capitalized fabricated (project) unit, the acquisition date is the date of the first cost. Other costs are subsequently added to the original cost as incurred, but the acquisition date is not changed.\nAny items known to have been part of a fabrication account, but the center numbers are not now known, are listed in the PAS in center 1-9111.\n\n\nDonated items, with a fair market value of $5,000.00 or more per item and a minimum useful life of 2 years, are capitalized. The fair market value of each item is used as its \"original cost\" in the PAS and recorded as a \"gift-in-kind,\" charging the appropriate movable asset account number.\nLeased or rented equipment (fund code \"C\") is capitalized at its fair market value if at the inception of the lease:\nThe fair market value is $5,000.00 or more, as determined by the Purchasing Department, and\nThe lease transfers ownership of the property to Carnegie Mellon by the end of the lease term, or\nThe lease contains a bargain purchase option, or\nThe lease term is 75% or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property, or\nThe present value of the rental or minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the leased property.\n\nThe Manual of Purchasing Policies and Procedures provides guidance in determining \"lease vs. buy\" decisions. Government regulations permit lease or rental costs to be part of cost recovery if (a) the rates are reasonable at the time of the decision to lease or rent, and (b) the cost recovered does not exceed the purchase price on the date the property was leased or rented.\n\nRepairs are not normally capitalized but charged to account number 8272. However, repair costs of $5,000.00 or more may be capitalized if they extend the item's useful life 2 years or more beyond its original life. This fact (if applicable) must be stated on the purchase order by the ordering department.\nThe following are also not included in capitalized costs:\nDemolishing or dismantling equipment (charge account number 8500).\nRearrangement, transfer or moving of capitalized items from one university location to another, including costs incurred in dismantling, transporting, reassembling and reinstalling such items in a new location (charge account number 8500).\nWarranty costs or maintenance contracts (charge account number 8277).\n\n\nB. Fixed Assets\n\nLand (Class Code 001) is capitalized but not depreciated; land improvements (Class Codes 005-009) are capitalized and may be depreciated.\nExisting buildings and new construction are capitalized (Building Class Codes 010 through 099).\nAdditions and renovations to buildings must be (a) greater than $5,000.00 for individual items, or (b) project costs of at least 20% of the total building cost or $100,000.00, whichever is lower. Examples of renovations are as follows:\nAdding additional square footage to an existing building.\nRemodeling an existing building, including floor covering, etc.\nA completely new heating, cooling or plumbing system.\nExtending wiring or plumbing to an area previously without such.\n\n\nReplacements or repairs that maintain or restore a building are not capitalized. For example, the cost of replacing worn sections of a roof are not capitalized, but the cost of replacing an entire roof is capitalized. Thus, a capitalized replacement is the total replacement of a unit with a new unit that serves the same purpose and has approximately the same expected useful life as the unit being replaced.\nBuilding costs are not reduced for materials, carpeting, etc., removed during building renovations unless a specific line-item in the PAS can be identified as being removed.\n\nIII.  Cost Recovery Methods\n\nA. Depreciation Policy\nThe university switched from use allowance to depreciation for cost recovery of movable assets beginning July 1, 1986. Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method - i.e., an equal amount of the original cost per year over the life of the asset. Depreciation is calculated from the day of acquisition to the day of disposal. In addition, the university switched from use allowance to depreciation for cost recovery of fixed assets beginning July 1, 1988. While both groups employ the straight-line method, when calculating depreciation for fixed assets, the half-year convention is utilized whereby a half-year of depreciation is taken for the fiscal year of acquisition and a full year taken for each subsequent year except for the final year, when the final half-year is taken.\nB. Use Allowance Policy\nBuilding acquisition costs are normally recovered at the rate of 2% per year based on a 50-year useful life standard. Equipment acquisition costs are normally recovered at the rate of 6 2\/3% per year based on a 15-year useful life standard. In some cases, exceptions to these useful lives may be authorized by the government. This recovery commences the beginning of the fiscal year of acquisition for equipment or the first fiscal year that a building is substantially complete. It stops at the end of the fiscal year of disposal.\n\nIV. Movable Asset Acquisition and Receiving\n\nA. Regular Department Purchases of Movable Assets\nProperty Accounting Review of Purchase Orders:\nA purchase order, placed by the university in accordance with the Manual of Purchasing Policies and Procedures, normally initiates the purchase or procurement of property. All purchase orders and changes to purchase orders submitted each day are reviewed by Property Accounting for items meeting capitalization criteria or to be included in the PAS for other reasons within the following categories:\n\nItems charged to capital furniture, equipment or software account numbers 8913, 8916 and 8919.\nItems charged by ordering departments to rentals and leases account number 8252 for equipment having a purchase price of $5,000.00 or more, as determined by the Purchasing Department.\nItems charged by Facilities Management Services to repair and maintenance account number 8272 for equipment having an estimated purchase price of $5,000.00 or more.\nItems charged to non-capital equipment and furniture account numbers 8905 and 8906 if the items are the same as or similar to other items previously acquired for more than $5,000.00.\nItems on trial or loan (for more than 90 days) having a purchase price of $5,000.00 or more, as determined by the Purchasing Department. Departments are to use Exhibit B, Non-Carnegie Mellon Movable Equipment\/Furniture, to notify Property Accounting of the receipt of such items. A copy of Exhibit B is to be given to the owner.\n\nEach item ordered must have its noun description on the purchase order. The building, floor, and room number where the item is to be used should also be included. In addition, where there are multiple lines of items, the purchase order should note if any of the items will be used together. (For example, items 2 and 4 will be used with item 1.) The \"requested by\" space on the purchase order should include the name of the person who will receive the item. Blanket purchase orders may not be used for any of the categories noted above (a thru e) except for rentals and leases. Purchase orders involving trade-ins must show the cost of the new item less the trade-in amount, and the Carnegie Mellon asset number of the trade-in. (See trade-in procedures in Section X under Disposal or Re-use of Movable Assets for further information.)\nProperty Accounting resolves any exceptions, where necessary, with the ordering department. Copies of the purchase orders are then made for Property Accounting's file. These copies are reviewed quarterly to investigate purchases which are not being cleared in a reasonable time.\n Property Accounting Review of Invoices, Journal Entries and Work Orders\nInvoices:\nEach day Property Accounting reviews vendor invoices being processed by Accounts Payable for capitalization criteria and account number errors. Copies of all invoices affecting the PAS are matched and checked against copies of purchase orders being held in Property Accounting's \"open\" file. The date of expense of the invoice is determined via Accounts Payable or other Accounting Department computerized records. The date of expense and the account number charged are then marked on the invoice copy for entry into the PAS.\nWhen a copy of an invoice is obtained by Property Accounting, a tag is assigned to each item. The tag's pre-printed asset number is written on Property Accounting's copy of the purchase order and the tag is attached to the document. Each item for which title remains with the government has a \"Property of U. S. Government\" tag also attached to the document. The data is then entered into the PAS and the document package is put in Property Accounting's file for tagging at a future date.\nAt the time that an ordering department approves an invoice for payment, that department must provide the following information to Property Management for each movable asset acquired:\nBuilding and room location where the item is to be used\nSerial Number of the item, where applicable\nLine Number on the purchase order for the item\nThis information is sent promptly to Property Accounting via one of the following means:\nCopy of the Purchase Order or Invoice\nWritten memo\nOther means approved by Property Accounting\n\nJournal entries:\nCopies of journal entries affecting movable assets are sent daily by Accounting to Property Accounting. These journal entries must indicate the Carnegie Mellon asset number of the movable asset involved, or the original purchase order number. If this information is not provided, the journal entry will be returned to the department which prepared it. Accounting also provides data to Property Accounting relating to any entries affecting fabricated equipment account numbers. After this data is entered into the PAS, the applicable documents are then filed under the Carnegie Mellon University asset number in Property Accounting's \"closed\" file.\n\nWork orders:\nIf alterations or renovations to a building are not part of a capital project, a department submits a work order requisition to Facilities Management Services (FMS). Facilities Management Services submits a purchase order to Purchasing for any necessary materials and movable assets. The purchase order indicates the FMS work order number. Property Accounting makes a copy of the purchase order and requests a copy of the completed work order from FMS. Any labor and materials associated with the installation of movable assets are charged by FMS to the requisitioning department's center and account, as are the costs of the movable assets. If the cost of a movable asset, including the cost of labor and materials for installation, is $5,000.00 or more, Property Accounting prepares a journal entry to capitalize the item. This charge is to the requisitioning department's center and account number 8916. The credit is to the requisitioning department's center and account number originally charged by FMS. Copies of the purchase order, work order and journal entry are then processed for tagging and filing as noted in paragraph A. Invoices.\n\n\nB. Items Donated to the University (including items transferred to Carnegie Mellon from other institutions)\nDonated movable assets (\"gift-in-kind\") are included in the overhead cost recovery calculation for sponsored research. Therefore, it is beneficial to all Carnegie Mellon University personnel that these assets are properly recorded on a timely basis.\n\nWhere a vendor invoice is not involved:\n\nThe donee department completes a Donated Item Receiving Report, and sends the form to Property Accounting. Property Accounting notes whether a response is needed from Development, and then forwards a copy to the Records Section of the Development Department. Development prepares either Gifts in Kind from Individuals, Corporate Donations of Property, and sends the form to the donor to obtain and document a fair market value or appraisal value for the item(s). Development also sends a copy of the form to Property Accounting if requested. If the donor is the government or other sponsor, Property Accounting sends a copy of the form to the Office of Sponsored Research. The Office of Sponsored Research notifies the cognizant Government Property Administrator of the receipt of such items. The donor returns the form to Property Accounting. If any donated item noted on the form qualifies as a capital asset, Property Accounting makes a copy of the returned form and matches the copy with its filed copies. Property Accounting sends the original of the donor's returned form to Development.\nWhere movable assets are involved, if the donor does not return the form within one month, Property Accounting obtains the fair market value from the Purchasing Department and enters those amounts into the PAS. When the donor's completed form is received, appropriate adjustments are made to the PAS where necessary.\n\nWhere a vendor invoice is involved:\nProperty Accounting sends Corporate Donations of Property form to the vendor. The donation may be one of the following:\n\nThe invoice states that the gross cost has been reduced by an \"allowance\" or includes other information which indicates the vendor is treating a portion of the item as gift-in-kind. The item purchased is recorded on the PAS (if the item's total unit value is $5,000.00 or more) at net cost plus the gift-in-kind amount.\nCarnegie Mellon receives a \"free\" item when one or more similar or dissimilar items is purchased. An example of a \"similar\" item would be a department's purchase of 5 computers at their normal Carnegie Mellon price, while receiving a 6th one at no extra cost. An example of a \"dissimilar\" item would be a department's purchase of a copier at its normal Carnegie Mellon price, and also receiving a typewriter at no extra cost. The normal Carnegie Mellon price of the typewriter is over $5,000.00. Procedures are as follows:\n\nThe purchased item is recorded on the PAS at net cost if the item's unit value is $5,000.00 or more.\nThe free item is recorded on the PAS as a gift-in-kind if the item's unit value is $5,000.00 or more. The item is recorded at the net unit cost of the purchased item if similar and known, or at fair market value obtained by Property Accounting from the Purchasing Department.\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of Property Accounting to notify Development at the close of each month concerning any gift-in-kind items where a vendor invoice is involved.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Property Accounting to reconcile its records monthly concerning all gift-in-kind items with Development's report of \"Details of Gifts Received for Fiscal Year to Date.\" At the end of each fiscal year, Property Accounting prepares a report summarizing all gift-in-kind items and provides copies of the summary to Accounting and Development.\nProperty Accounting prepares journal entries monthly for any non-capital gifts in kind as noted below.\nItems are charged to one of the following accounts:\n\n5-00000-2401 - Non-capital gifts-in-kind - rare books, manuscripts, non-capital equipment and furniture.\n5-00000-2402 - Non-capital gifts-in-kind - art objects and costumes.\n\nItems are credited to the following account:\n\n5-90000-8905 - Those items that were charged to 5-00000-2401 or 5-00000-2402 and exist in a campus building other than Mellon Institute.\n5-90001-8905 - Those items that were charged to 5-00000-2401 or 5-00000-2402 and exist in Mellon Institute.\n\n\nProperty Accounting prepares journal entries monthly for any fixed asset gifts-in-kind as noted below:\nItems are charged to the following accounts:\n\n5-00000-21XX - Utilities and Building-related Assets (the Xs identify the building).\n\nItems are credited to one of the following accounts:\n\n5-90000-8901 - Those items which exist in a campus building other than Mellon Institute.\n5-90001-8901 - Those items which exist in Mellon Institute.\n\n\n\n\nC. Purchases for Research Contracts\nRequired Authorization\nIt is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator of the project to (1) initiate the necessary papers for obtaining sponsor-furnished property, and (2) provide information required to establish and maintain university records. These papers and information are sent to the Office of Sponsored Research. It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research to obtain any prior approval authorizations from the sponsor concerning Carnegie Mellon University-purchased property. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to prepare the Equipment Screening Report form for any Carnegie Mellon University-purchased property for use with government contracts. Government regulations require such screening to determine that \"the need cannot be met with property already in the possession of\" Carnegie Mellon.\nThe procedures are as follows:\nUniversity-wide pre-purchase screening is required for equipment purchases of $100,000.00 or more per item. The form is to be used for this screening process. This form is sent to Property Accounting. The completed form, with a list of comparable items, is returned within 3 working days to the requestor for investigation. If equipment identified is similar and available for shared use, a Shared Use Agreement may be prepared and completed if desired or required by the lender. Copies of the agreement are provided to the borrower, lender, the Office of Sponsored Research and Property Accounting. If the screening process does not identify similar equipment for shared use, the Screening Request Form is attached to the purchase order and sent to the Purchasing Department. Property Accounting's list of comparable items, with notes as to the requestor's review, is attached to the ordering department's copy of the purchase order and kept on file there.\nThe Office of Sponsored Research sends a copy of the Request for New Center or Account Number, (or other written notice) to Property Accounting for each sponsored project that involves any capital equipment acquisitions. The Office of Sponsored Research uses the \"Additional Information\" space on Exhibit D to state whether title to the equipment is to be vested in the university or the sponsor. Property Accounting maintains these forms in a file by center number. All copies of purchase orders which indicate center numbers for sponsored research (1-4XXXX or 1-5XXXX) are checked against the file for proper authorization, including title information, prior to being put in Property Accounting's open purchase order file. The title information is noted on the copies of the purchase orders for subsequent data entry into the PAS. If government-titled equipment is authorized for transfer to a center other than that for which it was originally acquired, Property Accounting will make the change in its PAS but no entries will be made in the General Ledger. To the extent of any inconsistency between these procedures and the terms of a sponsor grant or contract under which property is provided, the terms of the grant or contract shall govern. Carnegie Mellon is directly responsible and accountable for all sponsor property in its possession, unless otherwise provided by the grant or contract. This includes sponsor property in the possession or control of a subcontractor. Subcontractors are responsible to comply with Carnegie Mellon's Property Accounting policies and procedures where applicable, unless the subcontractors have approved systems of their own.\nThe Principal Investigator is the custodian of the project property and is directly responsible for its use, maintenance, and protection. Title to project property rests with the sponsor or Carnegie Mellon in accordance with the terms of the grant or contract. It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research to submit property inventory reports to sponsors as required by the grant or contract.\nD. Surplus Government Equipment\nProperty Accounting maintains lists of surplus equipment available from the government. These lists are available for review in the Property Accounting Office, 407 South Craig Street, by all departments of the university. Any surplus equipment obtained from the government, for use other than on a research contract, is entered into the PAS with center 1-50000. Government restrictions may apply to particular items regarding their title, use and disposal.\n\nV. Fixed Asset Acquisition and Receiving\n\n                Purchase orders are the normal basis for acquiring fixed assets as well as movable assets. All purchase orders and changes to purchase orders for fixed assets, submitted each day, are reviewed by Property Accounting for those items charged to account number 89XX as well as capital building account 5-8XXXX-8XXX. This includes all building costs associated with new construction, additions, and renovations to be capitalized. Each item ordered must have the noun description of the item on the purchase order.Property Accounting gathers copies of purchase orders, invoices and any applicable journal entries to fixed asset accounts. Any exceptions, where necessary, are resolved with the ordering department. The documents are then put into Property Accounting's construction-in-progress fixed assets files. In account 5-8XXXX-8XXX, the first \"X\" in the 5-8XXXX center number is the fiscal year in which the project is initiated. The other three Xs in the center number indicate the particular project. The Xs in the account number identify the kind of expense. Each 5-8XXXX center number remains in effect for the life of the project in order to accumulate all related costs.When a capital project is substantially completed so that the area(s) of the buildings involved may be used for the purposes intended, all costs are totaled by account number. Those totals (except for movable assets accounts 8913 and 8916) are used by Property Accounting to prepare the necessary entries to capitalize the costs and enter the data into the fixed PAS. The documents are then put into Property Accounting's closed files.Standard reports for fixed assets provide (a) original cost and depreciation or use allowance amounts on individual records, summarized by building; (b) a listing of current year capital additions to new and existing buildings; and (c) a listing of current year deletions of buildings.\n            \nVI. Tagging of Movable Assets\n\nProperty Accounting personnel are responsible for the placement of Carnegie Mellon asset tags on movable assets when they are received. Any movable assets for which title is held by the government (Fund Codes G or E) also receive \"Property of U.S. Government\" tags. Departments receiving items may notify Property Accounting of the purchase order number by phone to arrange for tagging. In addition, a department, at its request, may enter into an agreement with Property Accounting whereby the department does its own tagging under Property Accounting's supervision in conformity with the university's property management policies and procedures.\nIf an item to be tagged cannot be located by the ordering department or Property Accounting, a red sticker is put on the purchase order or other source document for Property Accounting's files. The department's inventory list will have a \"not tagged\" message with each of these unlocated items.\nProcedures for affixing tags are noted on Locations of Tags on Movable Assets. As a general rule, tags are placed on all movable assets. This includes any equipment or furniture with a unit cost of $5,000.00 or more and a useful life of 2 years or more which is being used by Carnegie Mellon personnel and which:\n\nIs owned by anyone other than Carnegie Mellon (faculty, staff, government or other sponsors of research, other parties) and\nIs located in any room owned or leased by Carnegie Mellon, either on or off campus.\n\nSuch equipment is tagged and listed in the Carnegie Mellon University PAS for insurance, security, and control purposes, but not capitalized. The Non-Carnegie Mellon Movable Equipment\/Furniture form is used to record these items and report them to Property Accounting and a copy is given to the owner.\nPre-numbered tags are used on most assets. However, unnumbered tags are used with items having a value less than $5,000.00 but considered the same as or similar to another item previously acquired for more than $5,000.00 (for example: terminals, printers, etc.). The purpose of this is to eliminate the need for Property Auditors to spend time with department personnel during physical inventories to determine why the item is not tagged. These items are not capitalized or listed in the PAS; they are charged to account 8905 or 8906.\n\nVII. Maintenance of Movable Assets and Fixed Assets\n\n                Maintenance of all government property is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator. Maintenance of all other sponsor and Carnegie Mellon University property is the responsibility of the Departmental Property Officers and their personnel. This includes returning warranty cards as well as regular or periodic maintenance such as lubrication, cleaning or calibration. Maintenance should be performed in accordance with sound industrial practices and the terms of the grant or contract. Appropriate maintenance schedules may be determined by consulting equipment technical manuals. Carnegie Mellon's maintenance program also includes the inspection of buildings by Facilities Management Services personnel at periodic intervals to assure detection of deterioration and the need for repairs.Records of maintenance actions performed, and any deficiencies discovered as a result of inspections, are to be maintained by the persons responsible for maintenance. Maintenance costs are not capitalized.\n            \nVIII. Space Inventory\n\n                The Property Accounting Services and Indirect Cost offices are responsible for accounting for the allocation of space to departments within each Carnegie Mellon University academic, research and administrative building. Every room of these buildings is identified as to the using department, the function within the room, the room use code, the room area and other associated information. Space information is used for cost accounting, indirect cost distribution, property inventories, planning and analysis.For consistency among the space, movable assets and fixed assets records, Property Accounting assigns and maintains all building and room numbers. (See Exhibit J for building numbers.) Contractors or FMS personnel are responsible for physically placing those room numbers on doors, etc.Property Accounting conducts periodic space reviews of the academic, research and administrative buildings. Any space changes reported by Department Property Officers are entered into the Space database.\n            \nIX. Movable Assets Physical Inventory\n\n                At a minimum, physical inventories are conducted in every department every two years. In preparing to inventory a department, the Property Auditor gathers and reviews:\nFloor plans of the areas to be inventoried, as well as room classification lists for those areas. These rooms are checked against the lists provided to Property Accounting by the Environmental Health and Safety Manager concerning the locations of possible radiation and\/or chemical exposure on campus.\nLists of the assets to be inventoried.\nDocuments (with tags attached) in Property Accounting's files, including items being fabricated.\nLists of the assets covered during the last inventory.\nCopies of Authorization for Off-Campus Use of Movable Assets forms (Exhibit K). Exhibit K is to be used to record and authorize the use of movable assets in buildings not owned or leased by the university. Such movable assets are the property of Carnegie Mellon University, the government or other sponsors or agencies, and are being used by faculty or staff in their homes, as well as items loaned to other parties for off-campus use. Government property may not be loaned to any organization outside of Carnegie Mellon without prior written government approval. This approval is obtained by the Principal Investigator and kept in his\/her file. In such cases, the Principal Investigator is to notify Property Accounting by means of Exhibit K. Property Accounting periodically confirms a sample of the off-campus assets with the users. The Property Auditor then meets with the department's Property Officer to review these documents, locate and tag items, and discuss any other factors which might affect the inventory (such as items out for repair or loan, status of items being fabricated, areas difficult to inventory, locations of potentially hazardous materials, etc.). They agree on a date to start the inventory as well as an estimated time to complete the job. The department Property Officer alerts the affected personnel in the department concerning the planned inventory in order to have as much cooperation as possible.\n\nThe inventory covers all rooms assigned to the department. Room numbers and room shape are checked to the floor plan of the building and the room classification list. Also, any exceptions concerning the locations of radiation and\/or chemical exposure are reported to the Environmental Health and Safety Manager. Movable asset ownership is checked with the responsible room occupant. All other information on the inventory listing is verified, marking any changes necessary. Any items that are found in a room and that appear to meet the criteria for capitalization, but not listed on the PAS, are recorded on separate data entry forms (Exhibit L, Physical Inventory Form.\nWhen the physical inventory is complete, the Property Auditor works with the department Property Officer to clear the exception lists. One type of exception is an item found but not listed in the inventory. If reasonable efforts fail to produce a purchase order or other original document, the department Property Officer provides a memo to Property Accounting estimating the item's acquisition date, original cost, condition, center and origin. If it is determined that the item is to be capitalized, an inventory tag is put on the item. The item is then entered into the PAS as an inventory adjustment. The following center numbers are used as applicable:\n\n\n\ncenter number\nFund code\n\n\n\n\n1-91111\nL, R, U\n\n\n1-5XXX (applicable contract)\nF, G, E\n\n\n1-4XXX (applicable contract)\nD, S\n\n\nor\n\n\n\n1-41000 (if contract not known)\u00a0\nD, S\n\n\n1-50000 (if contract not knowm)\nF\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf it is determined that the cost is less than $5,000.00 and not to be capitalized, an unnumbered tag is put on the item and the exception list is noted accordingly.If, however, a purchase order or other original document is located, and it is determined that (a) the item was improperly expensed at the time of acquisition, and (b) an adjustment cannot be made in the Accounting records to capitalize the item, then the item is tagged and entered into the PAS as an inventory adjustment, using the information on the original document.If an item has a numbered tag on it but is not listed in the inventory, and investigation indicates that the item has been tagged incorrectly (item under $5,000.00 and not to be capitalized; etc.), the numbered tag is removed by the Property Auditor. No adjustment is made in the Accounting records. If there is any possibility that the item could be questioned in subsequent inventories as to whether it should be tagged, an unnumbered tag is put on the item. Unlocated items are coded \"U\" in the qualifier field on the PAS. Any items unlocated after 2 consecutive physical inventories (using the 1985-1987 cycle as the first) are treated as inventory adjustment disposals. The date of the latest physical inventory is recorded with each asset in the PAS. All physical inventory documents are filed by department in the Property Accounting Department and retained for 2 physical inventory cycles. A report of exceptions (items unlocated, as well as any items not in use) is sent to the department head after review with the department Property Officer. The department head is to submit a written response within 30 days of the Property Accounting report date. After updating the PAS for any changes provided by the department head, Property Accounting then sends a final report to the appropriate dean and senior management.\n\nX. Disposal or Re-use of Movable Assets\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), scientific equipment donated to Carnegie Mellon by manufacturers for research, experimentation or research training may not be transferred to other parties by Carnegie Mellon in exchange for money, property, or other services. Other donated equipment may also be restricted as to disposal. In addition, a donee organization who sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of charitable deduction property within three years after the date of receipt of the property must report the information on IRS Form 8282 (Exhibit V). It is Property Accounting's responsibility to submit this completed form, where required, to the IRS and the donor.Subject to the terms of the grant or contract, Carnegie Mellon may be liable when shortages of government property are disclosed or when government property is lost, damaged or destroyed, or when there is evidence of unreasonable use or consumption of government property as measured by the allowance provided by the terms of the grant or contract, the bill of materials or other appropriate criteria.The Office of Sponsored Research reports all cases of loss, damage or destruction of government property in Carnegie Mellon's possession or control to the Government Property Administrator as soon as such facts become known or when requested by the Property Administrator. The report contains all factual data on the circumstances surrounding such loss, damage or destruction. For any Carnegie Mellon subcontractors with government property in their possession or control which is accountable under a grant or contract, Carnegie Mellon requires the subcontractors to report all instances of loss, damage or destruction of such government property to Carnegie Mellon's Principal Investigator who advises the Office of Sponsored Research and Property Accounting.It is the Office of Sponsored Research's responsibility to submit to the government all final reports and requests for authorization to dispose of government property upon completion of a grant or contract. The Office of Sponsored Research notifies Property Accounting of the final disposition of the property by written memo so that the items may be removed from the PAS.\nIn order to comply with these and other Carnegie Mellon requirements, departments must notify Property Accounting concerning any property which is idle, no longer usable, damaged beyond repair, or which the department is disposing. For those movable assets being sold to parties outside of Carnegie Mellon, the best possible price is to be obtained. Assets must be sold on an \"as-is, where-is\" basis.See forms and procedures [PDF] for reporting required information for the 10 types of disposals.\nDepartments having movable assets for disposal or desiring used items may advertise in the 8-1\/2 x 11 News or on the Carnegie Mellon market b-boards. In addition, departments may contact Property Accounting concerning \"wanted\" items that may be available in other departments as recorded in the PAS.An asset having been disposed has a disposal code and disposal date in the PAS, and depreciation or use allowance is calculated, if appropriate, through the day in which the asset is disposed. The database of actual life history for disposed assets may be used to check the estimated life associated with each class of assets in the PAS.\n\nXI. Records Retention\n\n                The government requires that certain records be retained at least 4 years. These include purchase orders, accounts payable records, invoices, journal entries, paid checks, receiving reports, work orders for maintenance and other services, inspection reports, equipment records and some payroll records. Microfilming may be used for this record keeping. For further details, refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).\n            \nXII. Monthly and Annual Reconciliations\n\n\nAt the close of each calendar month Property Accounting prepares a report of all data entered during the month into the PAS. This report is reconciled with the Accounting Department's report of all capitalized entries in the General Ledger.\nAt the close of each fiscal year, depreciation is calculated on all applicable movable and fixed assets by department and building. A report is then prepared of all assets by department and building, showing the annual depreciation values by asset and total by department and building.\nAt the close of each fiscal year, Property Accounting prepares a report of all disposed assets by building. From that report, Property Accounting prepares the following entries:\nCharge 5-90000-8911 (net investment in plant - building disposal) or\nCharge 5-90000-8915 (net investment in plant-equipment\/furniture disposal) for the original cost of the asset and\nCredit 5-00000-22XX (to credit the building for the original cost at the asset's acquisition - XX is the building number - Exhibit J.)\n\nAt the close of each fiscal year Property Accounting prepares a report of all movable and fixed assets (exclusive of disposals) by building. The difference between the current and previous fiscal year totals by class code and building are used as follows to capitalize the assets:\nCharge 5-00000-2XXX (the Xs identify the type of property and the building - see Exhibits J and P)\nCredit 5-90000-89XX (campus buildings) (the Xs identify the General Ledger account number involved in the asset's acquisition - Exhibit C) or\n5-90001-89XX (Mellon Institute)\n\n\nIn addition, reports are prepared for all movable assets added during the fiscal year with transaction code \"9\" (no General Ledger entries involved), by fund code.\n\nXIII.

Questions about policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\nAppointment and Tenure Policy Librarian and Archivist Appointments Research Faculty Appointments Special Faculty Appointments\n\n\n\n\nConcept and Scope\nIn order to maintain the quality, flexibility and continuity of the academic activities of Carnegie Mellon University in all their aspects (instructional, scholarly, professional and artistic), the work of the regular faculty may be complemented by the services of other qualified persons engaged in educational activities in positions that confer faculty status.  This document concerns the full-time teaching positions of Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor (referred to collectively as the Teaching Track). These positions confer faculty status but are subject neither to the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University, nor to the Policy on Research Faculty, nor to the Policy on Special Faculty Appointments.  The designations Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor are specific to Teaching Track positions, and may not be used for any other positions in the university, unless preceded by distinguishing qualifiers such as visiting, special, part-time or adjunct.  Appointments to the Teaching Track are appropriate only for the performance of educational responsibilities that are, as certified by a decision of the regular faculty of the academic department concerned, so specifically focused as to be inappropriate for regular faculty, but require the employment of persons of sufficiently high caliber and specific talent as to justify the conferring of faculty status in order to attract and retain them, without requiring of them all the activities normally expected of regular faculty members.  Since the primary duties of Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor concern teaching, the main criterion for appointment and promotion is excellence in teaching. However, it is recognized that the diverse characteristics of the different colleges may make it appropriate for them to set additional criteria.  Faculty members should not be considered for appointments as Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor merely because attainment of tenure is unlikely.\nAppointment\nEvery appointment of an Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor shall be made in an academic department. All these appointments (including reappointments) in a college or school, and the specification of their term and of salary arrangements are made by the dean in accordance with the pertinent college or school policy (see below). Normal terms for each position are given below, although shorter terms are possible under special circumstances. (In the following specifications, the word \"year\" is used as in the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University.)  Appointments to the position of Assistant Teaching Professor are for terms of three years. Initial appointment as, or promotion to, Associate Teaching Professor is also for a three-year term, but subsequent reappointments as Associate Teaching Professor are for five-year terms. Associate Teaching Professors are expected to demonstrate exceptional mastery in teaching with a substantial impact on the university's educational mission.  Appointments as Teaching Professor are for five-year terms. Appointments at this rank are made only for extraordinary accomplishment in teaching and fundamental contributions to the university's educational mission. Initial appointments at, and promotions to, the rank of Teaching Professor are subject to approval by the provost, who may request the opinion of the University Tenure Committee in any individual case.  Initial appointments as Assistant Teaching Professor and Associate Teaching Professor are subject to the approval of the provost when the persons to be appointed hold or have held regular faculty positions at Carnegie Mellon University at or above the rank of assistant professor.  When an appointment or reappointment is made, it is the responsibility of the dean to ensure that the appointee is given clear and full information in writing concerning the terms of the appointment and his or her specific functions and duties, as well as concerning the nature of the Teaching Track. The dean shall also make sure that information on the appointment is available to the administration and, to the extent of its responsibilities, to the University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments.  An appointment in the Teaching Track does not establish an expectation of consideration for reappointment or promotion. Timely notice shall be given of every decision not to reappoint an Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor or to let an appointment (other than a terminal appointment) lapse. Notice is timely if given one year before the expiration of the term of appointment. In order to comply with this provision, it may be necessary to extend a term by an additional appointment of up to one year, designated as a terminal appointment, the decision not to reappoint or to let the appointment lapse notwithstanding.  During the terms of their appointments, Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor are subject to, and protected by, the same university policies concerning academic freedom and dismissal for cause (but not concerning reappointments) as are regular but untenured faculty members. They shall enjoy all normal regular faculty fringe benefits. For the purpose of the application of pertinent provisions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy, the ranks of Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, and Teaching Professor shall be regarded as equivalent to those of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor, respectively.\nCollege or School Review\nEach college and school shall establish policies specifying criteria and procedures regarding appointments, reappointments and promotions to Teaching Track positions. These policies should include provision for periodic review of the appropriateness of the use of Teaching Track positions, including the certification of such appropriateness by a decision of the department's regular faculty. These policies are subject to approval by the provost after review by the University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments.  Each initial appointment, reappointment or promotion in the Teaching Track, except initial appointments to the rank of Assistant Teach Professor requires a review by the department and by a college review committee. The procedures in force for the reappointment and promotion of probationary regular faculty members shall be adhered to as closely as practicable.\nUniversity Committee on Teaching Track Appointments\nThere shall be a University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments, constituted as follows: the provost, who shall preside, the deans of the colleges and the chair of the Faculty Organization shall be members of the committee ex officiis; the other members shall be appointed for staggered terms of two years and must be regular faculty members or Associate Teaching Professors or Teaching Professors; the provost and the chair of the Faculty Organization shall each appoint three members and the chairperson of the faculty of each college shall appoint one member.  The University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments shall review the college policies specifying criteria and procedures regarding appointments, reappointments and promotions to Teaching Track positions, and submit its recommendations to the provost.  The University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments shall conduct a triennial review of all Teaching Track appointments for the sole purpose of ensuring that the functions of these positions satisfy, or continue to satisfy, the requirements justifying their discharge by means of Teaching Track appointments. So far as practicable, this review shall be organized in such a manner that all such positions in the same college shall come under review in the same year. No decisions will affect the rights of an individual in the Teaching Track to complete his or her current term of appointment. The review shall not bear on the qualifications of the persons holding the appointments beyond the extent required to make the determination specified above. The deans shall submit to the committee all pertinent information together with their recommendations. The committee shall forward these recommendations together with its own to the provost for a final decision. Should problems be identified concerning the use of the Teaching Track in a particular college, the provost shall determine remedies after appropriate consultation.  In addition, the University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments shall monitor the general functioning of Carnegie Mellon's policy on Teaching Track appointments. To this end, the administration shall provide the committee annually with a summary report on the existing Teaching Track appointments, as well as with any other relevant and non-privileged information. The committee shall advise the Faculty Senate and the president on any matters concerning the university's policy that may be submitted to it, as well as on those that in its opinion require examination or amendment of this policy.  The chair of the Faculty Organization shall report each year to the Faculty Senate on the operation of the University Committee on Teaching Track Appointments.\nTransitional Provisions\nIn each college and school, appointments in the Teaching Track shall not be made before the date of the approval of the provost of that college's or school's policy specifying criteria and procedures regarding such appointments, as required by the provisions of this policy.  Persons who on the effective date of this policy hold appointments with the title of Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, or Teaching Professor may, notwithstanding the restriction of these designations to Teaching Track positions, retain the respective title during the current term of appointment and any subsequent uninterrupted reappointment terms at the same rank, even when these appointments remain not subject to the present policy.\n\u00a0  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\n\nPolicy on Conflict of Interest\/Commitment Policy on Consulting by Faculty Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Research Faculty Appointments Policy on Special Faculty Appointments Policy on Teaching Track\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nIt is the goal of the university to establish a climate that encourages voluntary joint efforts on the campus and mutual support across and within units and discourages the negotiation and selling of services within the university.\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that individuals employed by the university be compensated at a level commensurate with the total services they provide to the university and that this compensation be fully reflected in their annual salary. The principles and policies set forth in this document are to be used as guidelines in determining when internal consulting, with compensation in addition to one's annual salary, is and is not allowable and appropriate.\nWho Should Read This Policy\nThis policy concerns all faculty and exempt university employees.\nDefinitions\nBase Pay The level of compensation for full-time employment at the university.\nCommitment Period The period of time during which an employee is obligated to provide full-time service in exchange for a base pay. For instance, an academic year for an academic year's salary, even though this salary may be received over a twelve-month period.\nConsultant The individual who is the candidate for performing the internal consulting.\nDepartment or Unit The generic term for an academic or administrative unit. It can refer to a college, department, research center or an administrative unit.\nDepartment or Unit Head The administrative supervisor of a unit, whose actual title may be dean, chair or director, depending on the function of the unit.\nExecutive Education, Continuing Education, Pre-college Education Short, specialized courses organized by various units within the university.\nFaculty and Exempt Staff The population of Carnegie Mellon employees who are exempt from the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and to whom this policy applies; generally, full-time faculty (regular research, special, teaching track appointees and professional librarians), research staff members and administrators of the university.\nInternal Consulting Activities involving service to others in the Carnegie Mellon community for compensation in addition to one's base pay and in exchange for some consideration. Such activities could include, but are not limited to, consulting on another's research project (whether or not that research is supported by external research contracts), consulting on management issues or teaching classes in addition to one's normal teaching load (in another academic unit).\nPrimary Unit or Home Department The unit that controls an individual's DRIVE transactions; normally where the individual's primary appointment resides.\u00a0\nSemi-Autonomous Unit (SAU) This refers to the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).\nPrinciples\n\nInternal consulting may be inappropriate at Carnegie Mellon because:\nIt may be an impediment to the free and open interchange that is a central and necessary feature of the university environment.\nIt may come at the expense of the individual's obligations to the primary unit.\nIt may conflict with the individual's presumed full-time obligation to the university, and it would be undesirable to introduce procedures to account precisely for those time obligations.\nIt may run counter to grant restrictions for individuals supported by some external grants.\nIt may be used to bypass normal salary review procedures and thus lead to inequities in income from Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThe SAUs were established to benefit from their special access to Carnegie Mellon faculty and exempt staff as consultants, and thus SAUs are allowed to engage Carnegie Mellon faculty and exempt staff as internal consultants. Any such arrangement, however, must have the prior agreement of the head of the consultant's primary unit.\nExecutive education, continuing education and pre-college education are important activities undertaken by the university. In these programs, regular faculty and administrators may participate alongside external lecturers for additional compensation when it is clearly an addition to the normal teaching or administrative workload.\n\nPolicies\n\nPayment for internal consulting is not generally acceptable during a commitment period except in two cases:\nPayments may be made to a faculty member or exempt staff member for teaching in executive education, pre-college or continuing education programs at a rate consistent with that paid to comparable outside lecturers.\nA SAU may hire as a consultant a faculty member or exempt staff who is not currently an employee of a SAU. Any such consulting arrangements must have the prior approval of the primary unit head.\n\nPayment may not be made for teaching classes in addition to one's normal teaching load in another unit during a commitment period. This does not prohibit teaching classes for payment outside the commitment period and such teaching is not internal consulting.\nInternal consulting in cases not covered by A or B above is allowable when its benefits to the university community outweigh the costs to collegiality. All these situations must be reviewed by the intended consultant's unit head and dean, the provost and the vice president for business, and the result of this review recorded.\nThe internal consulting must be consistent with the Faculty Policy on Consulting, particularly the requirement that the faculty member will devote the appropriate amount of time to activities connected with the primary appointment and not sell more than 100% of the consultant's time.\nWhere time spent on internal consulting may be of sufficient magnitude as to cut into the consultant's primary obligation to the home unit, both the consultant and the consultant's primary unit should: 1) agree that it is appropriate for the consultant to participate in the activity; and 2) determine the appropriate reduction in effort to the home unit. The unit receiving the consulting should reimburse the primary unit for the percent of effort spent on the consulting activity.\nIn order to ensure that internal consulting is not used to bypass normal salary review policies, all cases of internal consulting must be approved by the consultant's unit head, the consultant's dean, the provost and the vice president for business.\nIt is inappropriate to subvert these policies by arranging internal consulting through an intermediary, whether that intermediary be a private corporation in which the intended consultant is a principal or one which hires the Carnegie Mellon person as a consultant to be assigned to Carnegie Mellon.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

The most recent revision was approved by the President's Council on July 17, 1996. An additional minor revision was added by Faculty Senate on September 11, 1996.\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nOffice of the Vice President for Operations.\u00a0Questions on Policy content should be directed to the University Police, 412-268-6232.\n\n\n\n\nContains university regulations regarding the use of bicycles and other wheeled transportation on campus.\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide regulations for a safe and convenient environment for bicycles and other wheeled transportation permitted on campus walkways (e.g., skateboards, in-line skates and motorized carts), while at the same time providing for the safety of all members of the campus community. These regulations do not apply to transportation for persons with disabilities (e.g., wheelchairs).\nPolicy\nThe operation on campus of bicycles (i.e., vehicles propelled solely by human-powered pedals) is subject to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. University police can provide information on how to obtain a copy of the Pennsylvania Driver's Manual.\nIt is Carnegie Mellon's goal to provide regulations for a safe and convenient environment for bicycles and other wheeled transportation (e.g., skateboards, in-line skates and motorized carts), while at the same time providing for the safety of all members of the campus community.\nOperators are required to operate at speeds that are prudent and reasonable under existing conditions. No person is allowed to operate any wheeled transportation inside any building or on any pedestrian ramp. In any circumstances, anyone using a form of wheeled transportation must yield the right of way to pedestrians. In addition, the use of skateboards and in-line skates may be restricted in certain areas.\nA bicycle is parked on campus at the risk of its owner. The Univeristy Police Department offers a facultative bicycle registration service with the objective of helping retrieve stolen bicycles; the Pittsburgh Police may be contacted for further information. It is strongly recommended that all bicycles used, stored, parked or operated on university property be licensed with and receive registration from University Police. Registered bicycles will be marked by a Carnegie Mellon University registration sticker. This sticker will note only the registration number. Owner information will be kept by University Police. This will allow University Police to notify a student, faculty or staff member if his\/her bicycle is subject to removal and give him\/her the opportunity to move it prior to impounding. There is no fee for registering a bicycle with University Police.\nFor operators' convenience, bicycle racks are provided at various campus locations. No bicycle shall be parked or stored in such a manner as to block entrance to or exit from any building or structure on campus, block walkways or stairs or to impede the normal movement of persons with disabilities. In addition, no bicycle or other form of wheeled transportation shall be parked, stored or left standing indoors in stairwells, hallways, foyers or any other location that violates federal, state or local fire and safety regulations.\nNo bicycle or other form of wheeled transportation shall be left in parking spaces provided for motor vehicles, on shrub or flower beds, or in any other places where they would hinder the travel of motor vehicles.\nFinally, use of any indoor area for bicycle parking may be restricted when, in the best judgment of the person(s) responsible for the area, movement of the bicycle to that area or storage therein interferes with the routine activities normally conducted in that area.\nRemoval and Impoundment of Bicycles\nAny University Police Officer or university official authorized by the university may remove and impound any bicycle which:\n\nBlocks or otherwise impedes normal entrance to or exit from any building on the university campus.\nBlocks or otherwise impedes traffic on any highway or sidewalk.\nIs parked in violation of any of the sections of this policy.\nAppears abandoned (unmoved from residential areas for at least six months; from academic areas for at least three months).\n\nBicycles or other wheeled vehicles impounded may be recovered only upon proof of ownership and after required fees are paid. Unclaimed bicycles shall be held for a minimum of three months, at which time the owner shall be presumed to have relinquished legal title. Such bicycles shall be disposed of through proper legal procedure.\nUniversity Police, Facilities Management Services or other university departments will not be responsible for any alleged damage or loss of accessories or equipment of an impounded unit.\nPenalty for Violation\nOwners are responsible for all costs involved in removal and storage of impounded items. Impounded units may be recovered only upon proof of ownership and after required fees are paid to the Universityi Police Department.\nOperators traveling in a manner that is deemed unsafe by a University Police Officer could be cited and issued the appropriate citation.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It appears in the current issue of the faculty handbook.\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nOffice of the Provost. Questions about policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial faculty appointments are full-time, non-tenure appointments that confer faculty status but are subject neither to the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University, nor to the Policy on Research Faculty or to the Policy on the Lecturer Track.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\n\nAppointment and Tenure Policy Teaching Track Appointments Librarian and Archivist Appointments  Research Faculty Appointments\n\n\n\n\nConcept and Scope\nIn order to maintain the quality, flexibility, and continuity of the academic activities of Carnegie Mellon University in all their aspects (instructional, scholarly, professional and artistic), the work of the regular faculty must be complemented by the services of other qualified persons engaged in the generation or dissemination of knowledge, on a part-time or full-time basis, in positions regarded as conferring faculty status.\nThis document concerns the full-time appointments that confer faculty status but are subject neither to the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University nor to the Policy on Research Faculty Appointments nor to the Policy on the Teaching Track Appointments; such appointments are herein termed special faculty appointments. This document does not deal with part-time faculty or with the use of students in teaching and research. Also excluded from its scope are librarians, research appointments in the Mellon Institute, the Information Technology Center and the Software Engineering Institute, members of the Department of Athletics and Physical Education, and R.O.T.C. personnel.\nCriteria\nSpecial faculty appointments are not to be regarded as an alternative to regular faculty appointments; they are appropriate only in the following cases:\n\nPost-doctoral fellowships and similar special instructorships; visiting professorships; positions for visiting professionals (e.g., writers-in-residence).\nResearch funded by external contracts, when a research faculty appointment is not appropriate.\n(i) Teaching or research, when the need is temporary, or as long as such teaching or research is available only through the employment of persons who would not qualify for regular faculty appointment; (ii) the performance of activities which, although so restricted to the teaching of routine skills or to support functions in research as to be considered not strictly academic, nevertheless require the employment of persons of sufficiently high caliber and specific talent as to justify the conferring of faculty status in order to attract and retain them, without requiring of them all the activities normally expected of regular faculty members.\n(i) Courtesy appointment of holders of full-time non-academic administrative positions for academic activities in fields in which they are specially qualified; (ii) occasional specialized instruction by persons appointed under category (B).\n\nFaculty members should not be considered for special faculty appointments merely because attainment of tenure is unlikely.\nAppointment\nThe making of special faculty appointments (including reappointments) in a college, and the specification of their term and of salary arrangements are subject to the approval of the dean. Every special faculty appointment or reappointment shall be for a term of at most three years. Appointments made under (A) above may not be renewed consecutively beyond an aggregate of three years. An extension of up to one year beyond this limit is permitted if required for the completion of the term of a fellowship that is explicitly designed as post-doctoral and is funded by external sources. Initial appointments made under (B) or (C) above are, in addition, subject to the approval of the provost when the persons to be appointed hold or have held regular faculty positions at Carnegie Mellon University at the rank of assistant professor or at a higher rank.\nWhen an appointment or reappointment is made, it is the responsibility of the dean to ensure that the appointee is given clear and full information in writing concerning the terms of the appointment and his or her specific functions and duties, as well as concerning the special nature of the appointment. The dean shall also make sure that information on the appointment, including specification of the category (A) - (D) under which it was made, is available to the administration and, to the extent of its responsibilities, to the University Committee on Special Faculty Appointments.\nA special faculty appointment establishes no claim to consideration for reappointment. Nevertheless, whenever an appointment is made for a term of one year or more and reappointment is neither ruled out by this document nor by the specific terms of the appointment, timely notice shall be given to the appointee of the decision to reapppoint or to let the appointment lapse. Notice is timely if given four months before the expiration of the term if such term is of less than two years, and six months before if the term is of two years or more.\nDuring the term of their appointment, special faculty appointees are subject to, and protected by, the same university policies concerning academic freedom and dismissal for cause (but not concerning reappointments) as are regular but untenured faculty members. They shall enjoy all normal staff fringe benefits.\nCollege Review\nEach research appointment made under (B) requires a review by the department and by a college review committee before any reappointment that would extend it beyond an initial four years or beyond three years since the reappointment following the latest review.\nEach college shall establish the appropriate procedures for this review. If, in the course of the review, it is determined that the activities of the position substantially resemble those of a regular faculty position, but that its replacement by a regular faculty position is inappropriate, the review shall then bear upon the qualifications of the candidate for reappointment, and the procedures in force for the reappointment of probationary regular faculty members shall be adhered to as closely as practicable.\nEach college shall also establish procedures for a review, at suitable intervals, of special faculty appointments made under (C) and (D).\nUniversity Committee on Special Faculty Appointments\nThere shall be a University Committee on Special Faculty Appointments, constituted as follows: the provost designated by the president to preside, the deans of the colleges and the chair of the Faculty Organization shall be members of the committee ex officiis; the other members shall be appointed for staggered terms of two years and must be regular faculty members; the president or his designee and the chair of the Faculty Organization shall each appoint three members and the chairperson of the faculty of each college shall appoint one member.\nThe University Committee on Special Faculty Appointments shall conduct a triennial review of all positions to which special faculty appointments are made under (C), for the sole purpose of ensuring that the functions of these positions satisfy, or continue to satisfy, the requirements justifying their discharge by means of special faculty appointments. So far as practicable, this review shall be organized in such a manner that all such positions in the same college shall come under review in the same year. The review shall not bear upon the qualifications of the persons holding the appointments beyond the extent required to make the determination specified above. The deans shall submit to the committee all pertinent information together with their recommendations. The committee shall forward these recommendations together with its own to the provost for a final decision. Should this decision be that the functions in question do not justify their discharge by means of a special faculty appointment, the person holding such an appointment may nevertheless continue in it until the end of his or her current term of appointment.\nIn addition, the University Committee on Special Faculty Appointments shall monitor the general functioning of Carnegie Mellon's policy on special faculty appointments. To this end, the administration shall provide the committee annually with a summary report on the existing special faculty appointments in the various categories, as well as with any other relevant and non-privileged information.

Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Dean of University Libraries, ext. 8-2447.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICITES:\nAppointment and Tenure Policy Teaching Track Appointments\u00a0 Special Faculty Appointments Policy on Research Faculty\n\n\n\n\nConcept and Scope\nThis Policy on Librarians and Archivists governs the appointments of the full-time professionals serving in the University Libraries, at the ranks of librarian or archivist, senior librarian or senior archivist, and principal librarian or principal archivist. These professionals have potentially long-term responsibilities specifically focused on current and lifelong learning, with a considerable level of initiative and autonomy, in support of the educational, scientific, humanistic, artistic, and professional objectives of the university, in the context of the broadly conceived mission of the University Libraries.\nThe designations librarian, archivist, senior librarian, senior archivist, principal librarian, principal archivist (herein referred to in condensed form as librarian\/archivist, senior librarian\/archivist, principal librarian\/archivist) are specific to positions governed by this Policy, and may not be used for any other positions in the university unless preceded by distinguishing qualifiers such as visiting, special, part-time, or adjunct.\nAppointment\nThe making of every appointment under this Policy (including reappointment with or without promotion), and the specification of its term and compensation require a recommendation by the university librarian, arrived at following the procedures specified in this Policy, and the approval of the president. The president shall also review every decision to let an appointment (other than a terminal appointment required to satisfy the provisions of this Policy for timely notice) lapse at the expiration of its term.\nWhen provisions of other university policies are made applicable under this Policy, references to the dean are to be construed as references to the university librarian.\nThe word \"year,\" when used in the specification of the duration of a term of appointment, is construed as specified in the subsection Years of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University.\nInitial appointment as well as reappointment at the rank of librarian\/archivist is for a term of three years. No more than two terms of appointment, whether consecutive or not, are permitted at this rank.\nInitial appointment at, or promotion to, the rank of senior librarian\/archivist is for a term of three years; every reappointment at this rank is for a term of five years. Senior librarians\/archivists are expected to demonstrate superior mastery in their professional activity with a substantial contribution to the university\u00eds mission.\nInitial appointment at, promotion to, as well as reappointment at, the rank of principal librarian\/archivist is for a term of five years. Appointment at this rank is made only for extraordinary professional accomplishment and fundamental contributions to the university\u00eds mission.\nIt is the policy of the university that the timing of a decision to promote an appointee under this Policy is to be governed solely by the judgment that the candidate satisfies the criteria for the proposed promotion, as indicated in the preceding paragraphs.\nWhen an appointment to a position governed by this Policy is made, it is the responsibility of the university librarian to ensure that the appointee is given clear and full information in writing regarding the terms of the appointment and the scope of his or her specific functions and responsibilities, as well as the contents of this Policy.\nAn appointment under this Policy does not establish an expectation of consideration for reappointment or promotion. However, timely notice must be given of every decision not to reappoint (where a reappointment is not ruled out by this Policy) or promote a librarian\/archivist, senior librarian\/archivist, or principal librarian\/archivist or to let an appointment (other than a terminal appointment) lapse. Notice is timely if given one year before the expiration of the term of appointment. In order to comply with this provision, it may be necessary to extend a term by an additional appointment of up to one year, designated as a terminal appointment, the decision not to reappoint or to let the appointment lapse notwithstanding.\nThe university may establish policies on leaves for appointees governed by this Policy. Such leave policies may provide for circumstances in which the nature and aggregate duration, during a term of appointment (other than a terminal appointment), of certain leaves authorizes or requires the university librarian to grant, with the consent of the appointee, an extension of the current term of appointment, such extension being for one year only or, but only in the case of a five-year term, for two years only; and such policies may provide for restrictions on the number and\/or frequency of such extensions. A leave policy providing for such extensions of terms of appointment requires the approval of the president.\nDuring the terms of their appointments, librarians\/archivists, senior librarians\/archivists, and principal librarians\/archivists are subject to, and protected by, the same provisions regarding academic freedom and sanctions (including dismissal for cause) as are applicable under the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University to regular but untenured faculty members. Appointees under this Policy enjoy all normal regular faculty fringe benefits. Since the appointments governed by this Policy typically involve an annual twelve-month commitment, these benefits include vacation time. For the purpose of the application of policies referring to ranks, the ranks of librarian\/archivist, senior librarian\/archivist and principal librarian\/archivist are regarded as equivalent to those of assistant professor, associate professor and professor, respectively.\nCriteria\nThe entire actual and potential contribution of the candidate to the mission of Carnegie Mellon University is to be evaluated. The main criteria for that contribution are librarianship and archival work and impact on the university\u00eds goals and objectives.\nEvidence may be organized in two main categories:\n1. Librarianship and Archival Work\nLibrarians and archivists facilitate scholars' access to information in support of the research, artistic accomplishment, and teaching missions of the University. Increasingly, the environment for librarianship and archival work is technological, resources are digital, and student use is by remote access. Librarians and archivists need to be conversant with library\/archival goals, standards, conventions and values, be able to interpret these within Carnegie Mellon\u00eds context, and be able to translate these factors into appropriate services and collections. By its nature, librarianship and archival work are collaborative endeavors, but librarians and archivists also are expected to demonstrate individual creativity and initiative. Candidates for the appointments governed by this Policy must demonstrate knowledge that contributes to the profession and to academic excellence.\nLibrarians and archivists have a broad range of individual assignments. Their goals and responsibilities in a variety of different units will be recognized in the evaluation process. Areas of demonstrated expertise may include, but are not confined to, the ability to:\n\nAnalyze and organize information systematically for easy retrieval by users in accord with national and international standards; initiatives, and access methods;\nIdentify, deliver, and provide access to information through resource sharing and collection development;\nInstruct faculty and students in defining information needs, in identifying, locating, and critically evaluating information sources and in documenting research results;\nDemonstrate leadership and innovation in planning, developing, and implementing new services and initiatives within the context of the University, libraries and archives in general, and national professional values and goals.\n\nCompetence in librarianship and archival work shall be documented by candidate statements, recommendations from faculty, student evaluations, statements from administrators and colleagues. Documentation may be obtained through a variety of means and solicited and unsolicited written opinions may be used.\n2. Research, Scholarly or Artistic Activities\nResearch, scholarly, or artistic activities lead to new knowledge, to increased problem solving, to best practices, and to original theories. Librarians create scholarship in all four typical categories:\n\nInquiry, with research on such topics as organization of information, user information needs, library contributions to learning, preservation and access, navigating cyberspace, and related topics;\nIntegration, with work, such as applying learning theory to instruction, employing communications theory for reference, and adapting administrative\/management techniques to libraries;\nTeaching, with research on developing, testing, and improving pedagogical techniques to meet the library\u00eds role in teaching people to be independent scholars;\nApplication, with studies on applying the first three categories to the successful practice of librarianship.\n\nCompetence should be documented by accomplishments, such as publications, presentations, commissions, inventions, honors from professional societies, and research proposals. The opinions of outstanding experts in the candidate\u00eds field will be sought for all decisions on appointments at the rank of senior or principal librarian\/archivist.\nOther Considerations\nConsulting, professional committee involvement, editorial work on professional journals, contributions to the welfare of the university community, and to the larger community will be considered as they relate to the two categories above.\nCriteria by Rank\nTo be promoted, a librarian\/archivist must demonstrate activities in each of the two main categories: Librarianship and Archival Work and Research, Scholarly or Artistic Activities. All the areas mentioned above will be considered in the evaluation process.\nFor appointment at or prior to promotion to the rank of principal librarian\/archivist, a candidate should:\n\nBe well established in his or her field;\nHave accomplishments at the level of extraordinary professional achievement and fundamental contributions to the university's mission;\nBe a recognized leader with a national reputation.\n\nFor example, appropriate achievements might include leadership in state, national, or international professional organizations, published research in refereed journals, editorial assignments, consulting, and presentations. An evaluation for reappointment at this rank should confirm continued growth in leadership and reputation.\nFor initial appointment at or promotion to the rank of senior librarian\/archivist, a candidate should:\n\nHave a record of accomplishment indicating a clear promise of leadership that will eventually deserve promotion to the rank of principal librarian\/archivist;\nDemonstrate superior mastery in their professional activity with a substantial contribution to the university\u00eds mission.\n\nFor instance, accomplishments might include professional committee appointments at the state and national level, presentations, outreach initiatives, and publications. Superior activities in librarianship and archival work and contributions to university mission will receive positive attention for this promotion.\nProcedures: Library Stage\nThe procedures and timing for preparing cases for appointment decisions, as well as the general rules for making these decisions, are adapted as closely as possible from those provided in existing university procedures as specified in writing by the university librarian and reported to the provost. In this adaptation, references to the dean are to be construed as references to the university librarian, and references to the department head are to be construed as references to the designated associate university librarian as defined below. In case of doubt regarding the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph, the university librarian makes a binding ruling in writing.\nFor each appointment case to be considered, the university librarian designates the associate university librarian he or she considers best placed to conduct the procedure; this designee is herein referred to as the designated associate university librarian.\nA recommendation on a proposed appointment decision is made by a discussion and vote at a meeting chaired by the designated associate university librarian, at which the following are entitled to vote:\n\nfor initial appointment at the rank of librarian\/archivist: all principal librarians\/archivists, senior librarians\/archivists, and librarians\/archivists;\nfor reappointment at the rank of librarian\/archivist, or initial appointment at, or promotion to, the rank of senior librarian\/archivist: all principal librarians\/archivists and senior librarians\/archivists;\nfor reappointment at the rank of senior librarian\/archivist: all principal librarians\/archivists and reappointed senior librarians\/archivists;\nfor initial appointment or reappointment at, or promotion to, the rank of principal librarian\/archivist: all principal librarians\/archivists.\n\nThe meeting is conducted, and a report of its proceedings and the outcome of the vote is prepared in accordance with the procedures as specified in the first paragraph of this section. Every recommendation is submitted to the university librarian, together with the report of the designated associate university librarian and the complete documentation of the case.\nWhen the action concerns an initial appointment at the rank of librarian\/archivist, the university librarian makes the recommendation to the provost upon receiving the designated associate university librarian's report and the accompanying documentation. In every other case, the university librarian submits the appropriate documentation to an ad-hoc committee, constituted as provided below, and makes the final recommendation after receiving and considering the ad-hoc committee's report.\nFor each case in which its report is required, the ad-hoc committee is appointed by the provost in consultation with the university librarian, and is constituted as follows:\n\nthe designated associate university librarian, as non-voting chair;\nthree appropriately ranked librarians\/archivists, chosen to reflect the various areas of activity of the University Libraries;\nthree appropriately ranked regular or research faculty members or lecturer-track appointees, one chosen from each of the three broad discipline areas: science and technology (Carnegie Institute of Technology, Mellon College of Science, School of Computer Science), arts, humanities, and social sciences (College of Fine Arts, College of Humanities and Social Sciences), and management science and practice (Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Heinz School).\n\nThe mission and procedure of the ad-hoc committee are those prescribed for the ad-hoc committees by the policies as specified in the first paragraph of this section.\nProcedures: University Stage\nAll procedures of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University are applicable mutatis mutandis to a recommendation of the university librarian to appoint, reapppoint, promote, or let an appointment lapse, with the exception that the president's decision does not require ratification by the Board of Trustees. In this process, the cognizant university committee is:\n\nThe University Committee on Non-Tenured Appointments for all evaluations for reappointment at the rank of librarian\/archivist and for initial appointment at or promotion to the rank of senior librarian\/archivist.\nThe University Committee on Tenured Appointments for all evaluations for reappointment at the rank of senior librarian\/archivist or for initial appointment at, or promotion to, or reappointment at, the rank of principal librarian\/archivist.\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions about policy content should be directed to Cost Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\nResponsibilities for Managing Carnegie Mellon University Financial Assets Cost Transfer Policy for Sponsored Programs Financial Records Retention Information Security Policy\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\nOMB Circular No. A-21, \"Cost Principles for Educational Institutions\"\nOffice of Naval Research\nDefense Contract Audit Agency\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThis policy provides a framework for the fiscal operations of Carnegie Mellon University's service centers that will ensure compliance with sound business practices, financial accounting and reporting principles and government regulations. It also provides guidelines for establishing and operating a cost center, determining appropriate billing rates and ensuring compliance with applicable federal regulations.\nCarnegie Mellon University conducts business under rules and regulations of federal, state and local municipalities. Policies and practices must adhere to government regulatory costing principles, such as those contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-21, \"Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,\" as well as internal university accounting policies and practices. As required by OMB Circular No. A-21, Carnegie Mellon University has incorporated the applicable federal Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in this policy and disclosed the provisions of this policy in the university's required Disclosure Statement to the Office of Naval Research and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nReason for the Policy\nCarnegie Mellon University, recognizing its responsibility to sponsors, regulators, the academic community and the public to ensure compliance with sound accounting principles and government regulations, has established the service center policy contained herein to provide consistent financial and operational practices among the applicable units and to ensure compliance with government regulations.\nService Centers\nThis policy applies to all auxiliary service centers and all recharge service centers (also referred to as internal cost recovery units). This policy defines and differentiates between auxiliary and recharge service centers and delineates their appropriate financial accounting, financial reporting and budgeting requirements in order to conduct business.\nA service center is an operating unit whose primary purpose is to provide goods, services or group of services in support of the university's education and research mission. Service centers include auxiliary enterprises and recharge service centers (internal cost recovery units).\nA service center has the following characteristics:\n\nIt provides services or sells goods to students, faculty, staff and\/or the public.\nThe same service might be purchased from commercial sources but, for reasons of convenience, cost or control, it is provided more effectively within the university.\nIt charges a fee related to, but not necessarily equal to, the cost of services or goods.\nIt is managed as a self-supporting, break-even unit.\nAn auxiliary service center's costs include direct operating expenses and all allocable general administrative expenses and facility-related costs. A recharge center's costs include all direct operating expenses.\nIt is expected to fund working capital and capital maintenance and replacement requirements.\nIt will accumulate adequate reserves to fund capital projects without drawing on the university's general reserves and\/or operating budget.\n\nAuxiliary Service Centers\nAuxiliary service centers include: housing, dining, parking, all retail stores, vending, printing, copying, mailing, and telecommunications. Auxiliary service centers are expected to recover all allowable direct and indirect costs through an appropriate rate-setting process. Auxiliary service centers are unique accounting entities and, as such, are required to maintain a separate set of books and records, including separate balance sheets and statements of activities. These service centers are also required to accumulate a sufficient amount of excess revenue over expenses in order to independently fund and preserve the university's financial investment in such activities.\nRecharge Service Centers\nRecharge service centers are internal cost recovery operations accounted for as designated accounts expected to recover all allowable direct costs, including departmental costs, through the appropriate rate-setting process. Recharge centers are required to account separately for activities in unique account numbers; however, unlike auxiliary service centers, recharge centers do not maintain separate balance sheets.\nOverview\nThis policy requires that:\n\nAuxiliary service centers will calculate billing rates annually that provide for recovery of all direct and indirect costs, including general university administrative overhead and facilities costs.\nRecharge service centers will calculate billing rates annually that provide for the recovery of all direct costs, including departmental administrative costs.\nService centers may accumulate a surplus at the end of each fiscal year and will be required to justify the surplus through the budget, internal audit and external audit processes. The appropriate justification consists of capital reinvestment plans or adjustment of future rates downward to achieve break-even the following year. Service centers may offset losses on one service with surpluses from another similar service only if the customers using the services are basically the same.\nService centers may carry forward deficits to the subsequent year with justification through the normal budget review process. In such instances, the deficits are expected to be covered via pricing in the next fiscal year. If such operating deficits cannot be recovered through future pricing, then they must be funded by the respective entity's educational and general budget in the fiscal year in which the unrecoverable deficit was incurred.\nBoth auxiliary and recharge service centers will retain all documentation for rate setting and service charge outs that is adequate to support an audit in accordance with the university's financial records retention policy.\nBoth auxiliary and recharge service centers will bill all external and internal users at the same prices unless there are justifiable differences in the nature of the service, in volume or in priority of delivery. Such changes must be documented in writing and forwarded to the assistant vice president for finance for coordination and approval, and be retained in accordance with the university's records retention policy.\nCapital costs (equipment greater than $5,000 and with an expected service life of two or more years) will be recorded in the auxiliary service center's balance sheet as a capitalized fixed asset. However, these costs must be recovered over the estimated useful life of the asset. Accordingly, depreciation expense will be recorded as an operating expense and recovered when developing billing rates.\nPurchases of equipment by service centers for either operations or inventory will be funded through annual surpluses generated from operations, replacement reserves from the recovery of accumulated depreciation, or internal loans. Users will be charged for depreciation through service center pricing; however, purchases of capital equipment will be made from accumulated reserves, surpluses and approved debt financing.\nEach service center must establish at least one account number specifically associated with it in which to record its revenues, expenses and recoveries. No service center activity should be charged to regular departmental account numbers. Similarly, if a service center has an activity for which it does not charge users, that activity must be accounted for via a separate account number associated only with that activity.\n\nUsers of Service Centers\nUsers of service centers are those existing within the university community, including those in academic, administrative and auxiliary areas, who purchase services to support their work at Carnegie Mellon University. Their work may also include federally sponsored projects.\nCaution: Allowing the use of university facilities and services by parties not otherwise associated with Carnegie Mellon University may carry tax-related consequences. Questions related to such use of university facilities and services should be directed to the assistant vice president for finance.\nResponsibilities\nDepartments\nUltimate responsibility for the management of service centers rests with the dean, department head or equivalent under whose unit the service center operates. Normally this person will delegate day-to-day responsibility to the department administrator or service center director who monitors the operation.\nThe department administrator or service center director must ensure that:\n\nAll direct and applicable departmental costs are recorded in the service center's account;\nRates for the next fiscal year are established based on the prior year's actual financial statement for each center and must be finalized by March 31 in order to establish the price of the services for the next fiscal year for communication to users;\nAt a minimum, billings must be made on a monthly basis and must be timely and accurate;\nThe approved rate schedule is applied uniformly to all users;\nAll users are billed at nondiscriminatory rates. (See the section on Recovery Requirements.)\n\nCost Analysis\nCost Analysis is assigned responsibility for the following:\n\nOverseeing the formation of service centers and establishment of their organization numbers (orgs) and object codes;\nAssisting service center directors with policy or procedural matters related to accounting operations;\nAssisting centers with the preparation of rate schedules and, where applicable, providing general administrative and facility-related overhead expense allocations;\nReviewing the annual financial statements of the service center for compliance with this policy prior to preparing the applicable indirect cost proposal for the university;\nCoordinating the financial audits of the respective service center with all external and internal auditors.\n\nBudget Office\nService centers should contact the Budget Office for assistance in establishing revenue, expense and capital budgets.\nWithin the context of the overall operating and capital budgeting processes, the Budget Office is responsible for reviewing and recommending approval of the budgets based on the annual rates to the Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees, reviewing revenue and expense reports, and reviewing the reasonableness of accumulated surpluses and the appropriateness of carrying forward annual operating deficits.\nInternal Audit\nInternal Audit is responsible for including audits of a selection of service centers in its work plan to ensure compliance with this policy.\nEstablishing Service Center Accounts\nRequests for new service center org numbers, as well as changes in existing org numbers, must be approved by the senior director, Sponsored Projects Accounting and Cost Analysis. This allows the proposed service center request to be reviewed for feasibility and ensures it will operate in accordance with federal cost principles and university policies.\nThe request for a service center org number must include the following:\n\nA description of users, and the goods or services to be provided;\nA detailed budget of projected annual expenses;\nA per-unit description of the work performed (i.e., labor hours, machine hours, or units of output) and an estimate of the amount of activity for the budget period;\nThe rate calculation(s) using the proposed budget amounts and the projected level of activity for the first year of operation. If a new service center is to be established in the middle of the year, the initial budget and break-even period may be set for longer than twelve months;\n\nThe name, title and phone number of the individual who has been delegated by the dean, department head or equivalent to be responsible for financial affairs of the service center; and\nThe signature of the dean, department head or equivalent indicating acceptance of operating and financial responsibility for the service center.\nUpon approval, service centers will be assigned org numbers. In addition, a new object code may be assigned for use when charging out costs to users.\nCharge-out Rate\nA service center charge-out rate, used to recover expenses, is the total costs of the service center divided by the units of output. Total costs are determined by subtracting from the budget all expenses, plus or minus any under- or over-recovery from the previous year. The units of output are the volume of work expected to be performed, expressed in terms of units such as labor hours, machine hours, CPU time, etc.\nThe usage base, or activity level, is used to arrive at a billing rate that reasonably allocates service center costs to those receiving its benefits. An appropriate usage base is essential to ensure users pay only their share of the costs for the services rendered. Two methods are most commonly used to determine the usage base: consumption and output. These methods distribute costs based on a unit of measurement (e.g., hours, pounds or gallons). The basis selected should be consistently used.\nConsumption base is used when expenses are directly proportional to how much a unit of measurement is consumed. For example, if usage costs are determined to be consumed on an hourly basis, the service center would base the charges on the number of hours of services provided.\nAnother basis of allocation may be a measure of the output of the service center. An output-based rate is calculated when the total cost of the service center is divided by the total anticipated number of units produced per year.\nService Center Cost Components\nDirect Personnel\nAn appropriate portion of the salaries and benefits of all personnel directly related to the service center activities, including departmental administrators such as directors, professional\/technical and clerical employees, must be directly charged to the service center's account number. Charging for such personnel through a fixed \"administrative surcharge\" is not appropriate.\nFringe Benefits\nFringe benefits must be included in the rate calculation based on university fringe benefit rates agreed to by the federal government.\nSupplies and Expenses\nThe cost of materials and supplies needed to operate the center should be included in the rate calculation. Preferred vendors should be utilized at all times; over-accumulation of inventory should be avoided.\nCertain service centers will base their operations on inventory, or will maintain an inventory of parts and supplies used in providing the services or goods (e.g., retail stores). Such service centers must account for them as assets of the university and charge the cost of the inventory to expense based on usage or consumption. Other costs associated with the operation of service centers may include rental and service contracts, travel to conferences related specifically to the service center, professional services and interest on debt used to acquire capital assets.\nThese costs should be properly identified by an org\/object code. Contact the senior director, Sponsored Project Accounting and Cost Analysis for any questions regarding the allowability of costs.\nEquipment Depreciation\nFederal regulations do not normally allow for the recovery of the purchase price or acquisition cost of a capital item through service center rates in the year acquired. It is appropriate, however, to recover such cost through depreciation over the item's useful life.\nCaution: Depreciation of service center equipment purchased or paid for by the federal government, whether or not title has reverted to the university, cannot be included in the rate calculation.\nSpace and Maintenance\nIn order for auxiliary service centers to fully recover costs, the cost of operation and maintenance (O&M) of facilities must be included in the rate calculations. O&M principally consists of building depreciation, utilities, maintenance, housekeeping and security. Cost Analysis personnel will provide auxiliary service centers with this information annually by January 31.\nAdministrative Costs\nAdministrative and departmental overhead must also be included in the auxiliary service center rate calculations. Only departmental costs are included in the recharge center rate calculations.\nCost Analysis personnel will provide auxiliary service centers with this information annually.\nUnallowable Costs\nUnallowable costs are defined in OMB Circular A-21 (Section J) and are expressly prohibited for inclusion in billings to university sponsored research and administrative operations by auxiliary and recharge service centers. However, service centers such as housing, dining, food, parking, retail stores and vending are permitted to recover unallowable costs through billings since these operations do not generally affect sponsored research direct or indirect costs. A detailed list of unallowable costs and related object codes is available on the Cost Analysis website.\nQuestions concerning unallowable costs should be directed to the senior director, Sponsored Projects Accounting and Cost Analysis.\nRecharge Center Subsidies\nIn certain instances, schools or departments may decide for valid business reasons to subsidize a portion of a recharge center's expenses (i.e., financing of initial capital requirements or ensuring that quality goods or services are available when needed). Given that all of the recharge center's account must contain all of the applicable direct expenses, subsidies must be recorded in the recharge center's account as an income transfer. Subsidies do not apply to auxiliary service centers.\nFederal Regulations\nService center activities can result in either direct or indirect charges to federal grants and contracts. To receive these federal funds, the university must comply with the U.S. Government's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, \"Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,\" which addresses questions of service center pricing. The principles set forth in A-21 are designed to provide recognition of the full, allocated cost of federally sponsored projects under generally accepted accounting principles.\nTwo key concepts are dealt with specifically in section J.44 of A-21: 1) recipients of federal funds are not to recover more than cost; and 2) they are not to discriminate in the price charged to governmental users from non-governmental users. The rules set forth in A-21 allow that break-even recovery may be achieved over a long-term basis if agreed to by the university and its cognizant government agency. A-21 also provides for mutual agreement on \"alternative costing arrangements.\"\nGovernment Oversight\nThe government monitors Carnegie Mellon University's compliance with these regulations through the Department of Defense (DOD), its auditors and its negotiators from the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Examples of compliance issues with respect to service centers may include rate-setting methodology, treatment of unallowable costs, and replacement of equipment and use of reserves. To minimize exposure from noncompliance, service centers must comply with these policies and procedures. The university's exposure from noncompliance could involve repayment to the government and could affect future award applications.\nRecovery Requirements for Regulatory Compliance\nNondiscriminatory Rates\nRates established by service centers must be nondiscriminatory and all users must be billed for services received. Nondiscriminatory means that all users are charged the same rate for the same level of goods or services purchased under similar circumstances. Therefore, rates should not be different for different users within the university community nor for federal and non-federal sponsors. The use of special rates, such as for high-volume work and for less demanding, non-scientific applications, is allowed but such rates must be equally available to all users.\nYear-end Billing\nService centers should handle year-end billings consistently from year to year to assure that twelve months of cost recovery are associated with twelve months of incurred cost.\nUnallowable Costs\nUnallowable costs, as outlined in A-21, may not be included in user rate calculations except as stated on p. 7 of this policy under Unallowable Costs.\nCapital Equipment\nCapital equipment costs will be charged directly to service center's org. However, the depreciation of capital equipment (not the acquisition cost) is included in the service center rate calculations and in determining net surplus or deficit from operations. Capital equipment is generally defined as an item costing $5,000 or more with an expected useful life of two years or more. Equipment with a lesser value is treated as an expense in calculating billing rates.\nBreak-even Concept\nMost service centers operate on a fiscal year basis, with rates based on budgeted projections of operating expenses and projected levels of activity or demand for its goods or services. Generally, the financial goal of a service center is to establish rates that will ensure that revenues reasonably offset expenses over the long term. Operating at break-even means there is no significant profit or loss resulting from charging users for goods or services in any particular period, and no profit or loss over the long run. This allows service centers to carry financial surpluses and recoverable deficits forward to the following year.\nTreatment of Over\/Under Recoveries\nAlthough service centers target a break-even state through the capital planning budget process and rate setting, expenses may not exactly match revenues. Under or over recoveries must be calculated based on actual revenues and expenses.\nIf a service center rate produces a profit or loss, the loss must be added to or the profit subtracted from the following fiscal year's budget when developing the user rate(s), so the operation will break even over time. This will not be necessary for surpluses if the service center can demonstrate that the surpluses are required for future capital replacement.\nIf a recharge service center produces a profit, the profit will be carried over to subsequent fiscal years.\nLosses may be carried forward only if recoverable through future pricing; otherwise, losses or deficits not recoverable through future pricing must be funded by the respective operating entity's educational and general budget. For example, a recharge center's current fiscal year direct costs are $50,000, billings to customers are $30,000, and the subsidy from the school's education and general budget is $15,000. The deficit of $5,000 must also be funded by the school's education and general operating budget if it is not recoverable in subsequent years' billings to customers.\nRequest for Rate Change During the Year\nService center managers should evaluate their financial position and rates periodically throughout the year to assess their position with respect to break-even and, if necessary, adjust rates accordingly. The review should also try to ensure cost types are clearly identified by account code, especially unallowable costs.\nService center rates should only be adjusted when it is evident that a service center will not fall within break-even range using the calculated rate. In such cases, centers must submit the new rate to Cost Analysis for review and approval by the provost and chief financial officer prior to implementing a rate change.\nPricing of Multiple Services\nA service center providing more than one service may sometimes make a surplus on some services and take a loss on others. Combining the results of various services is acceptable only if the mix of users of each service is the same, so that higher prices charged to one set of users are subsidizing only those losses charged to approximately the same group of users.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

The most recent revision was approved by the President's Council on February 2, 2007. It is issued in the Faculty Handbook and Student Handbook.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Questions on Policy content should be directed to the vice president and dean, Office of Student Affairs, 412-268-2075.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\u00a0 In early September, 2017, the university convened a group to review this Policy in light of recent events on campuses around the country. Pending the outcome of that formal review later this semester, and in order to enhance the environment for free expression at the university and ensure the safety of the community, the university is instituting an interim change to this Policy. Effective immediately, individuals and organizations who are not Carnegie Mellon students, faculty or staff who wish to distribute printed material, offer petitions for signature, make speeches or hold protests or demonstrations outside University buildings, are required to meet the same standards for outdoor events as are already applied to events inside campus buildings, including the requirements that events must have sponsorship from a member of the university community and must meet registration requirements. These interim changes will assure that events are planned thoughtfully, with the safety and security of members of our campus community being paramount concerns. Students, faculty, and staff will still enjoy normal use of outdoor campus spaces according to university policy. Questions should be directed to Gina Casalegno, Vice President for Student Affairs.\nPolicy Statement \nCarnegie Mellon University values the freedoms of speech, thought, expression and assembly - in themselves and as part of our core educational and intellectual mission. If individuals are to cherish freedom, they must experience it. The very concept of freedom assumes that people usually choose wisely from a range of available ideas and that the range and implications of ideas cannot be fully understood unless we hold vital our rights to know, to express, and to choose. The university must be a place where all ideas may be expressed freely and where no alternative is withheld from consideration. The only limits on these freedoms are those dictated by law and those necessary to protect the rights of other members of the University community and to ensure the normal functioning of the University.\nRights\nOn Carnegie Mellon's campus, anyone may distribute printed material, offer petitions for signature, make speeches, and hold protests or demonstrations outside university buildings. All such activities must be peaceful, avoiding acts or credible threats of violence and preserving the normal operation of the university. No event shall infringe upon the rights or privileges of anyone not in sympathy with it, and no one will be permitted to harm others, damage or deface property, block access to university buildings or disrupt classes. The enforcement of these conditions will not depend in any way on the message or sponsorship of the act or event. When guests are invited by a recognized campus organization, they may express their ideas not because they have a right to do so, but because members of the campus community have a right to hear, see, and experience diverse intellectual and creative inquiry. Defending that right is a fundamental obligation of the university. Controversy cannot be permitted to abridge the freedoms of speech, thought, expression or assembly. They are not matters of convenience, but of necessity.\nResponsibilities\nFreedom of expression must be at once fiercely guarded and genuinely embraced. Those who exercise it serve the Carnegie Mellon community by accepting the responsibilities attendant to free expression. University organizations that sponsor invited guests to campus are expected to uphold Carnegie Mellon's educational mission by planning carefully to create safe and thoughtful experiences for those involved. Hosts are responsible for the behavior of their guests and should exercise due care to ensure that all participants abide by relevant university policies.\nConsiderations for Planning Campus Events\nConsistent with the rights and responsibilities outlined in the university's policy on Freedom of Expression, university hosts must follow all applicable policies related to space reservation, use, safety and security, keeping in mind the responsibility to have campus police present for any event with 100 or more persons in attendance.\nHosts should consider the items below as guidance in planning campus events, recognizing that not all of the items below will apply to all events:\n\nA public declaration of the event, its purpose, the identification of sponsors and co-sponsors, and contact information for those seeking further information.\nA plan for advertising the event, including advance notice to relevant members of the community who may wish to co-sponsor, protest, or host other events in response to the planned activity.\nWhere appropriate, a clear and detailed contract with outside speakers, artists, or suppliers of services to ensure continuity of purpose and the ability of the host to reasonably control the event, consistent with the host's intent.\nA plan for access to the event, including notifying the community of reserved seats, ticketing, queuing protocol, or other relevant details or restrictions well in advance of the activity.\nA provision for security before, during, and after events, managed in coordination with the University Police. Specifically, non-university security personnel must have their allowable duties clearly delineated, in partnership with the UniversityPolice, with their role generally limited to personal security and not space management.\nA plan for participant engagement at the event, such as through a question and answer session, if relevant, with a clear delineation of the planned ground rules for the event set out well in advance.\nA strategy for hosting of additional events, discussions, or town meetings before or after a principal event to help provide a context in which the principal event may be best experienced.\n\nThe Office of Student Activities and the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs may assist in, or directly coordinate, some aspects of campus events, such as fostering discussions preceding or following an event, or accommodating an opposing view at an alternative event. It is assumed that the spirit of community, both among people and groups with opposing views, as well as between event sponsors and the Student Activities and Student Affairs staffs, will foster communication and cooperation in the planning of campus events. Whenever possible, Student Affairs will work in concert with University Police to notify occupants of buildings in advance of any potential disruption caused by such events.\nSecurity Personnel Statement\nAt times, members of the campus community or their invited guests may have a legitimate basis for being accompanied by independent security personnel. It is incumbent upon the host of such an individual to ensure that the University Police approve in advance the presence and scope of involvement of any such security personnel.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Specific questions about policy content should be directed to associate vice president for research and academic administration, ext. 1975.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFORMS:\n\nPayroll Reallocation Form\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nThis statement sets forth policy for transferring incurred costs on sponsored programs from one expenditure cost center to another.\nApplicability\nThis policy applies to all sponsored programs, federal, state and private, and all cost categories, including payroll costs.\nOriginal Charges to Cost Center\nThe first step in charging costs is to be certain that the initial charge is appropriate. Therefore, the initial labor certifications and other charges should be reviewed and authorized by someone who has knowledge of the appropriate cost center to which the charge should be made.\nCost Transfers\nA cost transfer is any adjustment or transfer of expenditures to\/from an externally funded contract or grant cost center by means of a university (1) payroll reallocation form or (2) journal entry form. A payroll reallocation form is used to adjust an allocation of effort that was processed in a prior month. A journal entry is used to adjust any non-salary charge that had previously been posted to a cost center (e.g., travel, materials). Diligent review of financial records and timely communication between principal investigators and departmental administrators should prevent the necessity for transfers; however, under certain circumstances transfers may be appropriate. Nevertheless, it is less burdensome and questionable to charge costs to the correct cost center at the time they are incurred.\nThe administration of cost transfers is extremely important and sensitive when federal funding is involved. Federal agencies which sponsor agreements at Carnegie Mellon University are especially concerned that costs can be specifically identified with the funded activity they benefit. The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 explicitly states that costs \". . . may not be shifted to other sponsored agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by cost overruns or other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the sponsored agreement, or for other reasons of convenience.\" The Circular goes on to say, \"Any cost allocable to activities sponsored by industry, foreign governments or other sponsors may NOT be shifted to federally-sponsored agreements.\"\nWhen contract records are reviewed, numerous or poorly documented cost transfers can result in federal regulators denying reimbursement of questionable charges or suspending our participation in federal programs. Therefore, it is essential to provide detailed written explanations justifying all cost transfers. Special care must be taken with cost overruns. Salaries, wages, services and goods that do not benefit another agreement may not be transferred to another account. Such cost overruns are considered \"cost sharing\" and must be handled in the manner described by the policy entitled Cost Sharing.\nCost Transfer Requirements\nThe Office of Sponsored Research is responsible for reviewing and approving all cost transfers, payroll or non-payroll, before they can be processed into the accounting records. To be considered allowable, cost transfers must be timely, documented and explained in detail, adhere to the sponsor's standards, and have all appropriate authorizing signatures. Cost transfers should be prepared and submitted as soon as the need for the transfer is identified, but under most circumstances, not later than 90 days from the original transaction date or the original date of labor certification. (Note: labor certification is the official approval of effort allocations, currently performed on a monthly basis, which assigns salary and benefit costs to the appropriate university cost centers. This process takes place within the On-Line Effort System.)\nCost Transfers within 90 Days\nCost transfers involving sponsored research projects (including payroll reallocations) that are processed within 90 days of the original transaction require approval signatures from the principal investigator (PI), the departmental administrator (DA), and the Office of Sponsored Research.\nCost Transfers over 90 Days\nOnly in the case of exceptional circumstances will cost transfers (including payroll reallocations) be permitted more than 90 days after the original charge or effort certification. The reasons for a cost transfer over 90 days after the original charge must be documented in detail and will require the signature of the principal investigator(s), the departmental business administrator, the associate dean of the college, the Office of Sponsored Research, and the associate provost for research and academic administration.\nCost Transfer Considerations\nIn general, cost transfers will result from one of the two situations detailed below. In either of these cases, it is critical that the specific situation necessitating the transfer be fully documented and supported by all relevant backup material. Relevant backup material would include a copy of the original accounting report expenditure and a written justification of why the transfer is appropriate.\n\nClerical error correction. Correction of typographical errors is allowable provided that the correction is made within the applicable time limits and is fully explained.\nIt is not sufficient to note that the cost transfer is necessary due to a clerical error. For example, an adequate explanation would be:\n\nTo correct entry error: account number 7104 should have been 8104.\nor\nTo correct transposition error: cost center 1-54000 should have been 1-45000.\n\nCosts benefiting more than one agreement. When a particular charge to a sponsored agreement benefits another agreement, that charge may be transferred to the other agreement provided that: (1) the initial charge could appropriately have been made to the other center, (2) the charge is represented in the approved budgets of both cost centers, (3) the transfer explanation is clear as to why the particular charge is appropriate to either of the cost centers, and (4) the transfer is processed within 90 days of the original transaction.\n\nIssues Related to Cost Transfers\nThe situations detailed below are often encountered in the administration of sponsored research projects. The proper treatment of these situations will generally, but not always, preclude the need for cost transfers. The Office of Sponsored Research can provide guidance and assistance when these issues arise.\n\nPre-award costs. For the effective and economical conduct of a sponsored project it is sometimes necessary for costs to be incurred prior to receipt of the award document and actual funding. In such cases, departments should request the Office of Sponsored Research to open a new research center. The early center number will become the permanent center number when the award is effective and no cost transfers will be required. If the anticipated funding is not received, these costs will need to be covered as an institutional expense as described by the policy entitled Cost Sharing.\nContinuation Costs. If a continuation award is anticipated after the end date of the original contract or current contract modification, costs may continue to be charged to the current active cost center. If the continuation award is denied, these costs must then be covered as an institutional research expense as described by the policy entitled Cost Sharing.\nClose-out of Sponsored Project Cost Centers. Principal investigators and departmental administrators overseeing sponsored research cost centers should be particularly careful to manage and monitor their expenses to avoid incurring costs that are not reimbursable. Principal investigators and departmental administrators should check the original contract and\/or the Office of Sponsored Research if they are uncertain about the allowability of a certain expense prior to charging the sponsored research cost center. If unallowable costs have been incurred, they must be removed from contract and charged to an appropriate departmental account following the procedures previously outlined. Generally, costs incurred beyond the project end date are not allowable. Ongoing correction of incorrectly charged expenses is preferable to adjustments in the last month of the sponsored agreement.\n\n3.1. Unexpended balances. Unexpended sponsored funding at the close of a project must, in most cases, be returned to the sponsor.

They should identify in writing any such conflicts to the Secretary of the Board of Trustees prior to engaging in the activity that poses the potential conflict. If a conflict of interest is found to exist, the Trustee, Officer or Key Employee involved should recuse himself\/herself from participation in decisions on behalf of the university that affect his\/her personal interests.\nConflict of Interest\nMembers of Carnegie Mellon University's Board of Trustees, its Officers and Key Employees are charged to act on behalf of Carnegie Mellon University and in support of its mission. In these capacities they are expected to hold the interests of the university paramount. An apparent conflict of interest might arise when an individual is in a position to influence the university\u2019s decisions in ways that could lead to personal financial gain or other advantage for the individual or his\/her immediate family or associates.\nIt is the obligation of each individual described above to promptly disclose to the Secretary of the Board of Trustees any activity, transaction, contract or interest in which he\/she is engaged, or anticipates becoming engaged or, to his\/her knowledge, in which any members of his\/her immediate family or associates are engaged or anticipate becoming engaged, that may pose a potential conflict of interest as it relates to his\/her position as a Trustee, Officer or Key Employee of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\u201cImmediate family\u201d is defined as a spouse, parent, sibling, child or any other person, whether or not related by blood or marriage, living in the same household as the individual.\n\u201cAssociate\u201d is defined as (i) any entity or any partner, executive officer, director or manager of any entity (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) that is directly or indirectly controlled by the individual, or (ii) any entity for which the individual has a material private interest in or with, such that his\/her private interest interferes in any way with his\/her responsibilities to the University.\nIf it is determined that an actual or potential conflict of interest does exist between the individual\u2019s interests or the interest of any of the individual\u2019s immediate family or associates, and those of the university, he\/she must recuse him\/herself from involvement in any decisions on behalf of Carnegie Mellon University regarding such matters relating to the conflict.\u00a0 After the nature of such interest has been disclosed and the individual has recused him\/herself from any decisions, such transaction may then be authorized or ratified by university or its Board of Trustees, in accordance with applicable law.\nForm and Process for Disclosure\nAnnually, the Secretary of the Board of Trustees shall provide to all voting members of the Board of Trustees, Officers and Key Employees of the university as described herein a Conflict of Interest Disclosure Statement in the form as attached hereto.\u00a0 This disclosure statement shall be confidential, but shall be available for review by the Board of Trustees and its authorized agents and representatives.\u00a0 The disclosure statement, or the information contained in the statement, shall be open for inspection by others only: (a) by official action of the Board of Trustees upon showing of good cause; (b) by court order; or (c) as otherwise required by Pennsylvania or federal law or regulation.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained in this Policy shall be deemed in any way to expand, alter or change any duties or obligations of the Board of Trustees from those required under the Pennsylvania Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1988, as amended.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

The policy helps ensure the university\u2019s philanthropic relationships are managed in a collaborative and professional manner that will maximize the university\u2019s ability to secure and steward donations, fully engage its constituents, and ultimately fulfill the mission of the university and the donors\u2019 philanthropic goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nKey Roles in Fundraising In order to manage the university\u2019s relationships with its prospects, University Advancement oversees the assignment of staff, faculty, and volunteers to the following roles:\nProspect Relationship Manager (PM) - Each assigned prospect will have a unique PM, who is typically a member of the fundraising staff employed by the university. Couples will be managed by the same PM and will be counted as a single prospect for portfolio purposes. In addition, prospects who are members of the same family will generally be managed by the same PM (e.g., siblings and parents\/children); however, these prospects are counted separately for portfolio purposes. The PM is responsible for developing a strategy for each assigned prospect that is consistent with the university\u2019s comprehensive fundraising plans, and for ensuring that the strategy is implemented in an efficient and timely manner. The PM will either have the primary personal relationship with the prospect or will help guide\/coordinate the actions of other university personnel or volunteers involved in the relationship. Contacts with prospects by other advancement personnel must be cleared through the assigned PM.\nStrategy Leader (SL) - Prospects may also be assigned an SL. The SL, who is not a member of the fundraising staff (e.g., the university president, provost, deans, or faculty leading key initiatives), is assigned to inform strategy and share content with the PM. They may also lead the personal (face-to-face) relationship with the prospect. An assigned SL is not required for every prospect. A prospect may be assigned more than one SL.\nSecondary Relationship Manager (SM) - The SM is a member of the advancement staff who shares an active role in the fundraising outcome of the relationship. In the case of prospects who are assigned to the UA Management Team, this may include college-based gift officers. More than one SM may be assigned to a prospect. SMs may share in the credit for fundraising metrics, as appropriate.\nPlanned Giving Advisor - The PGA is a staff member of the Office of Gift Planning assigned to assist the PM when planned giving discussions are anticipated or occurring. Only one PGA can be assigned per prospect at a given time.\nVolunteer - A Volunteer is an individual who is not employed by the university who has agreed to help facilitate the university\u2019s relationship with a prospect. Multiple volunteers may be assigned to a single prospect.\n\nProspect Management, Reassignment, and Inactivation As a foundational principle, all prospects are prospects of the university. The Vice President for University Advancement, or his\/her designee, currently the Office of Advancement Prospect Management and Research (\u201cProspect Management Office\u201d), shall assign prospects based on the assignment rules outlined below. Should questions or special circumstances regarding prospect assignment arise that are beyond the scope of this policy, the Vice President for University Advancement will have the final responsibility for making prospect assignment determinations.\nAssignment Prospects will be typically assigned to PMs in the college of primary affiliation. This includes fundraisers employed in University Advancement who represent a specific college, school, or program (hereafter referred to collectively as \u201ccollege\u201d). Specific PM assignments in a college will be made by the respective college chief advancement officer, in consultation with and subject to the review of the Prospect Management Office. This principle notwithstanding, the following categories of prospects will be specially reviewed by the Prospect Management Office to ensure the most appropriate assignment:\nMembers of the Board of Trustees, President\u2019s Global Advisory Council, and other presidential advisory committees.\nProspects with high capacity ratings, who have demonstrated multiple interests across the university.\nProspects who are prominent or influential figures or who have a high-profile relationship with the university.\nProspects with demonstrated interest in university initiatives, or general university programs, such as Athletics, Students Affairs, the Libraries, etc.\nProspects with a primary interest in planned gifts may be assigned to fundraisers in the Office of Gift Planning.\nProspects whose primary residence is located outside the continental United States may be assigned to fundraisers in the Office of International Development.\nProspects who are parents only (i.e., parents of current\/former students who have no other university affiliation) will be considered for assignment to fundraisers in the Office of Parent Engagement and Development as a first priority.\n\nIn managing the prospect assignment process, the Prospect Management Office will review the prospect\u2019s current relationship with the university and\/or any existing relationships with administrators, deans, faculty, or advancement staff. Where possible, the Prospect Management Office will consult with the relevant college chief advancement officer(s) when assignments to central-based fundraisers are made.\nThe PM, college chief advancement officer, and Prospect Management Office will consult with each other prior to any additional assignments being made for a prospect, namely: strategy leader(s), secondary relationship manager(s), planned giving advisor, and volunteer(s). However, in cases where a college-based gift officer is not the PM, the college dean will be added as a strategy leader and\/or the college chief advancement officer (or his\/her designated college-based gift officer) will be added as a secondary relationship manager, as appropriate.\n\nReassignment\nProspect reassignment will be managed by the Prospect Management Office, in consultation with chief advancement officers and PMs. Reassignments are typically made when fundraisers suggest or mutually recommend a reassignment, when there is a staffing change, or when a prospect is not being actively managed by his or her current PM during a 12-month period. Other cases include, but are not limited to, a prospect\u2019s status change (e.g., becoming a trustee or member of the President\u2019s Global Advisory Council or other presidential advisory committee), a rating change, relocation to a region outside the continental United States, or another significant shift in the prospect\u2019s relationship with the university.\n\nInactivation The Prospect Management Office (in consultation with the relevant college chief advancement officer, when appropriate) will make decisions regarding prospect inactivation. If a PM determines that a prospect should be inactivated for any reason, that prospect\u2019s name must be brought to the Prospect Management Office for review, together with a written rationale for why the prospect should be inactivated. In select cases, the Prospect Management Office may choose to reassign the prospect to another fundraiser rather than inactivating the prospect. Inactivated prospects are still maintained in UA\u2019s database of record and may be reactivated at a future time. Inactivation will occur automatically when the Prospect Management Office learns that a prospect is deceased.\n\nPortfolio Management\nThe Prospect Management Office, in consultation with the UA Management Team and college chief advancement officers, will establish guidelines for the appropriate numbers of prospects that should be assigned to different types of fundraisers. These guidelines will inform individual fundraiser performance plans.\nIn addition, each college may maintain a portfolio of reserved unassigned prospects from which college-based and centrally-based gift officers can draw to help fill trips. These unassigned prospect pools, defined by college affiliation, will be created and maintained by the Prospect Management Office. Each such portfolio will be managed by the college\u2019s chief advancement officer. The chief advancement officer is expected to review the unassigned prospect pool, in consultation with the Prospect Management Office, on an annual basis.\n\nIntegrity of Prospect-related Data and Information in Database of Record It is the responsibility of the PM to keep prospect-related data and information up-to-date in UA\u2019s database of record, including but not limited to:\nContact Reports: The PM\u2019s interactions with a prospect (e.g., visits, phone calls, letters\/emails, etc.) must be documented in contact reports. In addition, the PM is responsible for ensuring\/confirming the entry of contact reports for interactions by other individuals assigned to the prospect (e.g., strategy leaders, secondary relationship managers, and volunteers) or involved in some other way. The Prospect Management Office will hold the PM accountable for appropriately documenting prospect contacts. Contacts should be entered into UA\u2019s database of record within 5-10 business days of the activity.\nProspect Stage: The prospect must be moved through the four main relationship stages: qualification, cultivation, solicitation (ask made), and stewardship. It is the responsibility of the PM to determine when a prospect moves from qualification to cultivation, or if the prospect should be inactivated. Prospects are automatically moved into the ask-made stage when a proposal has been submitted to the prospect and has been entered into UA\u2019s database of record. Prospects are also moved automatically into the stewardship stage when a pledge is booked (but is not paid off). PMs are notified when a pledge is paid and determine if the prospect should move back into cultivation at that time.\nCampaign Target: The campaign target is the estimated total amount of Carnegie Mellon gift solicitations for a particular prospect during a university campaign. Note: This dollar figure (not a range) is initially calculated via an algorithm; however, PMs (with supervisor or program head sign-off) can override the algorithm with a custom entry.\nInclination\/Engagement: The prospect\u2019s estimated level of overall engagement with the university (High, Medium, or Low). Note: This rating is calculated via an algorithm; however, PMs (with supervisor or program head sign-off) can override the formula with a custom entry.\nProposals: The PM is responsible for ensuring that all proposals are maintained in UA\u2019s database of record. This includes anticipated proposals, proposals in development, submitted (\u201coutstanding\u201d) proposals, and closed proposals. A closed proposal must have a status of Approved, Rejected, Inactivated, or Withdrawn. Most major gifts should have an associated proposal in UA\u2019s database of record, and it should be entered into the database no later than the date of proposal submission.\nProspect Interest: The PM is responsible for maintaining special initiative information on his\/her prospects. Special initiatives are areas of focus for the university that relate to its strategic plan. Prospects can have multiple prospect interest codes in UA\u2019s database of record.\n\nPrior Approvals and Independent Efforts\nThe university recognizes the various ways relationships develop between prospects and university administrators, faculty members, Advancement personnel, other university staff, students, and volunteers. That history is often a primary reason a prospect becomes more engaged with the university. Despite this reality, it remains in the best interest of the university for members of its community to ensure coordination of efforts. Pursuant to this policy, the PM is responsible for coordination of such relationships, and must be consulted by other members of the university community prior to embarking on any new engagement or fundraising strategies.\nThe university further recognizes that university administrators, faculty members, Advancement personnel, other university staff, students, and volunteers will identify new prospects. The names of new prospects should be relayed to UA\u2019s Prospect Management Office in order to ensure that there are no current relationships or strategies pending with those prospects; that a record is created for each new prospect in UA\u2019s database of record; and that actions are in compliance with this policy.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Carnegie Mellon University conducts business under the rules and regulations of federal, state and local municipalities. Policies and practices must adhere to government regulatory costing principles, such as those contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-21, \"Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,\" as well as internal university accounting policies and practices. As of September 1995, Carnegie Mellon has incorporated federal Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Consequently all records and documentation of the university's compliance with CAS are required to be maintained in the same manner as other financial records described. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 4.7 and 52.2-5 and OMB Circular No. A-133 specifically require documented policies and procedures regarding the retention of records.\nIn addition, anyone generating records while working in an official university capacity should contact the university archivist, ext. 8-7268, regarding their preservation (see the Policy on Historic Records).\nPurpose\nRetaining records serves two purposes. In the short term, it provides those responsible for management with the means to monitor transactions and resolve problems. In the long term, it enables the university to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service regulations and other federal, state and local regulations governing auditability.\nApplicability\nUniversity financial records are university property and include: annual reports, budget and financial statements, government contracts produced or received, gifts and donor agreements, spreadsheets or other software programs that document calculations, memoranda, correspondence, planning documents and receipts, e-mail messages to the extent they authorize or provide substantiating information, or other documentation of individual entries made in the transaction of its business. This policy applies to all original documentation supporting the accuracy, applicability and method of calculation for all financial entries.\nThis policy applies to all original or archival forms of storage media, including: paper, microfilm, microfiche and\/or jackets, aperture cards, optical disks, CD ROM, 8mm or other magnetic tape, computer drive, any size diskette or other magnetic, film or optical media.\nThis policy applies to all units at Carnegie Mellon University.\nRecords Retention\nIt is the responsibility of departments to designate a person to be responsible for records retention. Many departments designate the business manager. The designated person should have appropriate knowledge of and access to departmental financial data.\nDesignated personnel and all university staff and faculty are required to comply with the following:\nRetention Periods\nThe required retention period for various documents associated with an activity is dependent upon the source of funds used to support that activity. At the end of the required retention period, documents should be destroyed in an acceptable manner (see Methods of Disposal, below). Documents of permanent historic significance should be sent to the University Archives for preservation (see the Policy on Historic Records). For the required retention periods of various documents, refer to Appendix A - Financial Records Retention Schedule[1] at the end of this document.\nLegal and Audit Requirements\nWhen requirements for long-term retention of records overlap, the responsible office should retain records for the maximum period needed to meet both legal and audit requirements. General rules are:\n\nDirect Charges to Contracts and Grants: Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records and all records pertinent to a contract or grant's activity must be retained for at least seven years, unless a litigation claim or audit is started before the expiration of this period. In these cases, records need to be retained until seven years after all litigation, claims or audit findings are resolved.\nBusiness Transaction Records for Centers Included in the Indirect Cost Rate: Records must be retained for six years following the final sign-off for that year by the federal government. Contact the Cost Analysis Office for information on included centers and accounts.\nAll Other Business Transaction Records for Centers Not Included in Contracts, Grants or the Indirect Cost Rate: Records must be retained for six years following the end of the fiscal year.\nIndividual Employee Payroll Information: Records must be retained for seven years from retirement or termination.\nTaxable Income (cash receipt information and billings, and all documents for activities deemed unrelated business income): Records must be retained for six years following the end of the fiscal year.\n\nLonger retention times apply to certain documents. See Appendix A - Financial Records Retention Schedule[1] for a listing of documents, their retention periods and responsible department.\nManagement Information\nWhen a central office has retention responsibility, the department initiating a transaction may discard copies of documentation supporting the transaction when it is no longer needed for management purposes. For example, after the transaction is complete and the expenditure statement containing the transaction has been reviewed, departments may either dispose of or keep copies of documents at their discretion.\nMedia\nDocuments may be stored on the most efficient and effective media available as long as the long-term archivability and usefulness of the records are maintained, and the viability and accuracy of the transfer to the archival media are ensured. This may entail, for example, ensuring that the software and hardware necessary to read any magnetic media are available in working order for the duration of the required retention period. Responsible departments should work in partnership with their computing systems provider to ensure usability of archived data.\nAll forms of media must conform to the established standards for use and storage related to that medium. Consult the university archivist, ext. 8-7268, for information on the various standards and storage requirements.\nElectronic Transactions\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is electronic, the department responsible for maintaining the application is responsible for retaining the transaction record. This retention may employ the most efficient and effective media available, as discussed above. (See Appendix B[2] for a list of current responsible departments.)\nDepartments that create and transmit journal entries electronically must retain all source and supporting documentation for the entries as cited in the Retention Period section. If this is impractical, the source documentation may be given to the Office of the Controller for retention on a pre-approved schedule. In the latter case, Office of the Controller will assume the responsibility for proper retention and disposal of the records. Contact the Office of the Controller to discuss arrangements for this service.\nPaper Documents\nWhen the source documentation for a transaction is paper, the office that receives the original document is responsible for retaining it. In some cases, a central administrative office (such as Payroll or Accounts Payable) is responsible for retention.\nDocuments Retained Centrally by the University\nCertain documents, either original or archival media, are maintained by the central administrative offices of the university. These records do not need to be duplicated in other offices. If you are unsure whether a particular document is retained centrally, contact the Office of the Controller before disposal.\nSee Appendix A - Financial Records Retention Schedule[1] for a listing of documents, their retention periods and responsible department.\nRetention of Supporting Documentation by Service Centers\nService center charges are subject to audit as long as the grants or contracts they charge (either directly or indirectly) remain subject to audit requirements. Service centers are also subject to periodic review by the university's Internal Audit Department and by external auditors, to evaluate compliance with established university policies and accounting practices. Therefore, service center activities must be adequately documented and records must be maintained to support expenditures, billings and cost transfers. (For a definition of what constitutes a service center, see the Policy for Auxiliary and Recharge Service Centers.)\nEach service center must, at a minimum, retain the following:\n\nDocumentation on how the chargeout rate(s) were calculated, including the algorithms and components of the rate structures used.\nThe Rate Approval Letters from the Cost Analysis Office.\nSupporting documents related to expenses incurred, including transaction forms and salary data for all current employees.\nRecords supporting utilization (level of activity).\nRecords supporting the amount and basis of user billings (revenues).\n\nService centers under long-term agreements must retain their records until either their annual report is audited or that year is \"closed\" by Carnegie Mellon's cognizant government agency, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), whichever is later. Service centers should contact the Cost Analysis Office before disposing of any records.\nRetaining Records at an Off-site Location\nIn order to safeguard the assets of the university in the case of extreme physical disaster, records of permanent or long-term value should be stored in secure off-site locations. The university has negotiated agreements with a number of preferred vendors for off-site storage. The responsible department should arrange for the appropriate off-site storage of their financial records. For more information on off-site storage vendors contact Procurement Services.\nAll records, regardless of media, should be stored in containers capable of surviving the storage period while maintaining the physical integrity of the records. Records should be clearly labeled with a description of the contents, the responsible department, the origination date and the disposal date. For advice on the proper storage of records, contact the university archivist.\nMethods of Disposal\nAt the end of the required retention period, financial records may be disposed of unless they support current audit or litigation. Records may be disposed of via recycling in accordance with the university's recycling policy. The only exception to this is documents containing information, such as name or social security number, that could identify any individual member of the campus community. Documents containing this type of information must be disposed of via incineration or pulverization. Please contact the university archivist, ext. 8-7268, regarding secure disposal methods.\nConfidentiality\nIn order to safeguard the privacy of individuals, documents that contain salary information are treated in a highly confidential manner.

Questions should be directed to\u00a0Trademark Licensing Office,\u00a0ext. 8-3904.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\nUse of Carnegie Mellon Trademarks\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to conducting its business affairs in a socially responsible manner consistent with its Strategic Plan.\u00a0 The plan recognizes that the University's responsibilities extend beyond the confines of the campus: \"Through our education, research and creative expression, the university relates to an unusual extent to the world beyond our campus. Our activities have impact by creating knowledge, improving the quality of life, enhancing culture, and advancing economic and environmental sustainability.\"\u00a0\nCarnegie Mellon thus values the welfare of the diverse people who help to manufacture the products that contain our brand image and trademarks. Carnegie Mellon condemns the use of sweatshop labor in the manufacturing of any product that bears the trademarks of this institution; therefore, Carnegie Mellon has written the following Code of Conduct that establishes minimum standards for its trademark licensees. Carnegie Mellon will select only those licensees who will conduct their business in a manner consistent with this Code of Conduct and who will commit to following its standards.\nCarnegie Mellon acknowledges that the adoption of a code of conduct by a single university will not immediately abolish the use of sweatshop labor at home and\/or abroad; however, we do believe that collectively, institutions of higher education and our licensee partners will make a difference.\u00a0 The reputations of higher education, trademark management and licensing offices, manufacturers, trade associations, retailers, government agencies and licensees are impacted by their position on sweatshop abolishment.\u00a0\nCarnegie Mellon believes that employees have a right to earn wages that enable them to meet their basic needs, including housing, energy, nutrition, clothing, healthcare, education, potable water, childcare, and transportation.\u00a0 Although the concept of a \"living wage\" is not as yet an internationally recognized standard, we strongly urge licensees to pay wages that cover basic material needs, particularly when licensees operate in jurisdictions where minimum wage laws do not exist, are not enforced, or clearly fail to meet basic needs.\nCarnegie Mellon recognizes that workers are also members of local communities and therefore expect that licensees will be accountable to the communities in which they conduct their operations. We therefore expect that trademark licensees, in addition to complying with the code that follows, will also consider ecological impacts from the production and life cycle of their products.\u00a0 In their use of resources, a licensee should consider long-range outcomes and compensate local communities for any degradation of the natural environment.\u00a0\u00a0 Licensees should minimize and strive to eliminate the release of any pollutant that may cause environmental damage to air, water, or land or its inhabitants.\nLicensees are encouraged to respect the cultural traditions of the communities in which they conduct operations. This should include recognizing cultural and religious holidays where appropriate and acknowledgment of indigenous cultural architecture, environment and language.\nLicensees are encouraged to work with local communities to create economic diversity by decreasing the reliance on a single production economy where applicable.\nNotice\nThis Code of Conduct shall apply to all trademark licensees of Carnegie Mellon. Throughout this Code of Conduct the term \"licensee\" shall include all persons or entities who have entered into a written Trademark Licensing Agreement with Carnegie Mellon to manufacture products bearing the name, trademarks and\/or images of Carnegie Mellon.\n\"Licensee\" shall also include the licensee's contractors, subcontractors, vendors, manufacturers, sub-licensees and any related entities throughout the world engaged in the manufacturing process that results in a finished licensed product for the consumer. \"Manufacturing process\" shall include assembly and packaging.\nAs a condition of being permitted to produce and\/or sell licensed products bearing the name, trademarks and\/or images of Carnegie Mellon, each licensee must comply with the \"Standards\" in this Code of Conduct and also ensure that its contractors comply with the Code of Conduct's standards. This Code constitutes a new requirement for licensees pursuant to the terms in the Licensing Agreement. Accordingly, all licensees and contractors are required to agree in writing to this new provision and to adhere to this Code's standards within 6 months from the date of execution of the licensing agreement.\nRemediation\nIf Carnegie Mellon determines that any licensee has failed to remedy a violation of this Code, Carnegie Mellon will consult with the licensee to examine the issues and determine the appropriate measures to be taken. At minimum, the remedy will include taking steps necessary to correct such violations.\u00a0 If consultation and agreed upon measures fail to adequately resolve the violations within a specified time period, then Carnegie Mellon and the licensee will implement a corrective action plan on terms acceptable to Carnegie Mellon.\nStandards\nCarnegie Mellon seeks licensees who take a leadership role on these issues and, to the extent practical, exceeds the standards in this Code. Carnegie Mellon licensees must operate work places, and ensure that their contractors operate work places, that adhere to the following minimum standards and practices:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LABOR\nForced Labor\nThere shall not be any use of forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise.\nNon-discrimination Policy\nNo person shall be subject to any discrimination in employment, including hiring, salary, benefits, advancement, discipline, termination or retirement, on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, political opinion, age, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, handicap, social or ethnic origin, or of any other attribute, which would be in violation of applicable laws.\nChild Labor\nLicensees shall not employ any person at an age younger than 15 (or 14, where consistent with International Labor Organization practices for developing countries where the law of the country of manufacture allows such exception). Where the age for completing compulsory education is higher than the standard for the minimum age of employment stated above, the higher age for completing compulsory education shall apply to this section. Licensees agree to consult with governmental, human rights, and non-governmental organizations, and to take reasonable steps as evaluated by the University to minimize the negative impact on children released from employment as a result of implementation or enforcement of the Code.\n2. BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS \nCollective Bargaining\nLicensees shall respect the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining. No employee shall be subject to harassment, intimidation or retaliation in their efforts to freely associate or bargain collectively.\nFreedom to Communicate\nNo employee shall be subject to harassment, intimidation or retaliation for exercising the right of free speech pertaining to employee's interests. Employers\/Licensees shall recognize that it is the right of employees to be free to communicate with outside non-government organizations (NGO's).\nSpecial Consideration for Women\nCarnegie Mellon, recognizing that women form a majority of the garment industry workers, further expects that:\nWomen workers will receive equal remuneration, including benefits, equal treatment, equal evaluation of the quality of their work and equal opportunity to fill all positions open to male workers.\nPregnancy tests will not be a condition of employment, nor will they be demanded of employees.\nWorkers who take maternity leave will not face dismissal nor threat of dismissal, loss of seniority or deduction of wages, and will be able to return to their former employment at the same rate of pay and benefits that is reasonable with the law of the country. A twelve-week leave without pay shall be granted where no law exists.\nWorkers will not be forced or pressured to use contraception as a condition of employment.\nWorkers will not be exposed to hazards, including glues and solvents that may endanger their safety including their reproductive health.\nLicensees shall provide appropriate services and accommodation to women workers in connection with pregnancy.\n\nViolence, Abuse and Sexual Harassment\nEvery employee shall be treated with dignity and respect. No employee shall be subject to any physical, sexual, psychological, or verbal harassment or abuse. Licensees will not use or tolerate any form of corporal punishment.\n3. WORKPLACE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH\nHealth, Sanitation and Hygiene Conditions\nEmployers\/Licensees shall provide a safe and healthy working environment to prevent accidents and injury and illness arising out of, linked with, or occurring in the course of work or as a result of the operation of Employer\/Licensee facilities.\u00a0 This includes working to eliminate exposures to hazardous substances, such as glues, solvents, dusts and other substances that may endanger worker health. Toward this end, employers shall provide appropriate training and safety equipment to prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, linked with, or occurring in the course of work or as a result of the operation of Employer\/Licensee facilities.\nThe Licensee shall ensure that its direct operations and those of any subcontractors comply with all workplace safety and health regulations established by the national government where the production facility is located, or with federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations; whichever regulation is more health protective for a given hazard.\n4. ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY\nThe Licensee shall ensure that its direct operations and those of any subcontractors comply with all local and national environmental regulations.\u00a0\n5. WAGES AND HOURS\nWages and Benefits\nEmployers shall recognize that wages are essential to meeting employees' basic needs and pay employees, as a floor, at least the minimum wage required by local law or the prevailing industry wage, whichever is higher, and shall provide legally mandated benefits. \nOvertime\nOvertime and hours of work for U.S. employees shall be governed by the laws of the United States. Employees working outside of the United States shall (i) not be required to work more than the lesser of (a) 48 hours per week and 12 hours overtime or (b) the limits on regular and overtime hours allowed by the law of the country of manufacture or, where the laws of such country do not limit the hours of work, the regular work week in such country plus 12 hours overtime and (ii) be entitled to at least one day off in every seven day period.

Hourly and\/or quota-based wage employees working outside of the United States shall (i) not be required to work a regular work week of more than the lesser of (a) 48 hours per week or (b) the limits on regular hours allowed by the law of the country of manufacture, and (ii) be entitled to at least one day off in every seven day period, as well as holidays and vacations.\nCompliance and Disclosure\nPrior to licensing or licensing renewal, the licensee shall provide the following to Carnegie Mellon:\n\nThe company names, owners and officers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and nature of the business association for all of the licensees' contractors and manufacturing plants which are involved in the manufacturing process of items which bear, or will bear, the name, trademarks and\/or images of Carnegie Mellon;\nWritten assurances that it and its contractors adhere to the \"Standards\" in this Code (except that in the initial phase-in of the Code, licensee must provide such written assurances within 6 months of receipt of this Code);\nA summary of the steps taken, and\/or difficulties encountered, during the preceding year in implementing and enforcing this Code at each site.\n\nThe licensee shall immediately report to Carnegie Mellon when changes occur that materially affects the application of these labor standards, such as the selection of a new factory.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

A person entitled to this exception may, however, opt in writing to be governed by this Policy without exception.\n\nPrinciples\n\nAcademic Freedom and Responsibility\nIn all educational activities, each faculty member has the freedom and the responsibility to choose the material and the format that will, in his or her judgment, best serve the objectives of the specific course or activity as well as of the educational program of Carnegie Mellon University. The faculty member has the right to express opinions on matters pertinent to the subject; he or she has the responsibility to respect the freedom of belief of the students and their right to express their opinions, and the duty to make clear the distinction between information and opinion.\nEach faculty member has the freedom to determine how to make contributions to his or her field, in education, research, scholarship or artistic creation, and the responsibility to adhere to the ethical standards and the evidentiary criteria generally accepted by professionals in that field.\nIt is the duty of the administrative officers and of the trustees of Carnegie Mellon University to assist and protect the faculty in the exercise of these freedoms and responsibilities.\nStandards of Faculty Conduct \nBy accepting membership in the university, an individual joins a community committed to free inquiry, intellectual honesty and respect for the dignity of others. It is a community open to constructive change.\nThe welfare, indeed the survival, of the academic community rests on the willing consent given by its members to the principles that guide their conduct. They all, faculty, students, administrators and staff, have the responsibility to take care that the highest standards of integrity be adhered to in the conduct of all academic affairs.\nThe university affirms the right of its members to organize and join political associations, to convene and conduct public meetings, and to advocate and publicize their views by verbal means and by public demonstration. It is entitled to expect from them that they maintain and affirm a continuing concern for the interests of the university as a whole.\nSanctionable violations of these standards of faculty conduct include, but are not limited to: engaging in fraudulent or otherwise unethical conduct in academic affairs, or encouraging or tolerating such conduct in other members of the university; misuse of authority to harass, intimidate, or defame others; interference with the normal performance of duties and functions of members and invited guests of the university; theft or willful destruction of property of the university or of its members.\n\nFaculty Appointments:  General Policy\n\nRanks\nThe regular faculty of Carnegie Mellon University consists of persons with the ranks of instructor, assistant professor, associate professor and professor (this last rank is sometimes referred to as full professor, to prevent confusion). Full professors of particular distinction may be honored by conferring on them the title of university professor.\nThe rank of instructor is reserved for persons who are in the process of completing the customary preparation in the relevant field, whether that is the doctorate, a terminal professional degree or an appropriate apprenticeship; no one who has completed such preparation may be appointed or reappointed at the rank of instructor.\nTenure\nRegular faculty members other than instructors and assistant professors are appointed with or without indefinite tenure, according to the provisions of this Policy. An appointment with indefinite tenure extends without limit in time and assures the appointee of continued service without the need of recurring appointments. Indefinite tenure is instituted to recognize that the appointee has established himself or herself permanently in the regular activity of Carnegie Mellon and of the general academic community, and to provide an effective safeguard for academic freedom. Indefinite tenure is institution-wide in scope: once it is granted to a faculty member, subsequent faculty appointments at Carnegie Mellon, whether by promotion or by transfer to another academic unit or otherwise, shall also be made with indefinite tenure.\nIn keeping with common practice in the academic community, the term indefinite tenure is sometimes abbreviated in this Policy to tenure (as, e.g., in tenure decision): the term tenure shall not, in this Policy, carry the broader dictionary meaning of \"term of appointment\" that it has, e.g., in Article II, Section 4 of the By-Laws of the Board of Trustees.\nAll faculty appointments without indefinite tenure are made for a definite term, as specified in the subsection on \"Terms\" of the section of this Policy entitled Faculty Appointments: Term of Appointment and Timing of Decisions.\nTermination\nA faculty appointment with indefinite tenure will terminate only if and when one of the following circumstances occurs: (1) retirement; (2) resignation; (3) death; (4) commencement of an accepted superseding appointment (e.g., upon promotion from associate professor to professor, or upon entering on a permanent position at another institution); (5) dismissal for cause, upon one or more of the grounds stated in the section of this Policy entitled Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions, and subject to compliance in good faith with the procedures specified there; (6) termination due to bona fide financial stringency of the entire institution so severe as not to be capable of relief by less extreme measures. A faculty appointment without indefinite tenure will terminate before the expiration of its term only if and when one of the circumstances stated in items (1) through (6) inclusive as listed in the preceding paragraph occurs; otherwise it will terminate upon the expiration of the term of appointment without reappointment or promotion, subject to the provisions of the subsection on Timely decisions of the section of this Policy entitled \"Faculty Appointments: Term of Appointment and Timing of Decisions.\"\nAuthority\nEvery decision on faculty appointment, granting of tenure and termination of appointment (other than by death or resignation) is made by the Board of Trustees acting upon a recommendation by the president. This Policy contains provisions that are aimed at ensuring that the president's recommendation is informed by the results of an orderly process of consultation with, and recommendations by, faculty members and academic administrators.  The precise terms and conditions of each appointment shall be stated to the appointee in writing. No oral commitment supplementing terms stated in writing shall be made or recognized.  Every written communication offering an initial faculty appointment prior to its approval by the Board of Trustees must include, to be valid, the following statement: \"This appointment is subject, before becoming effective, to approval by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University.\"\n            \nFaculty Appointments:  Term of Appointment and Timing of Decisions\n\nTypes of Appointment\nDecisions to make faculty appointments are distinguished in this Policy as initial appointments, reappointments and promotions. A faculty appointment is called an initial appointment if immediately before its commencement the appointee does not hold a regular faculty appointment at Carnegie Mellon, regardless of whether he or she had earlier held such an appointment and regardless of any employment at Carnegie Mellon in some other capacity. An appointment of a person already holding a regular faculty appointment is called a reappointment if the rank of the new appointment is the same as the rank of the current one; it is called a promotion if the rank of the new appointment is higher.\nA decision on whether an initial appointment, or a reappointment or promotion of a faculty member without indefinite tenure, should be made with indefinite tenure is called a tenure decision, and if the decision is affirmative its outcome is called the granting of tenure. The same terminology applies to a decision on whether a current appointment without indefinite tenure should be converted into an appointment at the same rank with indefinite tenure.\nA reappointment is called a terminal appointment if it is made for the sole purpose of satisfying the requirements of due notice in the case of a negative decision on reappointment or promotion or a negative tenure decision, as provided in the subsection on Timely decisions of the present section of this Policy.\nA reappointment or promotion is called a transfer appointment when it is made in an academic unit different from the one in which the current appointment is held.\nA faculty appointment is called a joint appointment if it is made in more academic units (departments, or colleges or schools) than one. For administrative purposes, one of the participating units is designated as the home unit. A joint appointment has a single rank and a single tenure status. At any given time, a joint appointment has a salary-and-commitment distribution that may lie (for two participating units) anywhere between 50%-50% and 100%-0% inclusive.\nYears\nWhen the length of the term of a faculty appointment without indefinite tenure is stated as a number of years, as well as when a year during the term of appointment is referred to in this Policy, the term year means the period from 1 July of one (Gregorian) calendar year to 30 June of the following calendar year, except that the first year of an initial faculty appointment is deemed to begin on the date on which the appointment becomes effective and to end on 30 June of the next calendar year.\nThis definition is not meant to affect, by itself, the determination of salary, the timing of salary payments or the distribution in time of the duties and responsibilities of the appointment. In particular, it is intended to allow for the traditional use of an \"academic year\" of about nine months' duration to serve as the basis for the determination of salary and of the time in which the duties of the appointee corresponding to that salary are to be carried out.\nTerms\nThe specification of terms of appointment in this subsection refers to all appointments other than terminal appointments. The term of a terminal appointment is determined according to the provisions in the subsection on Timely decisions of the present section of this Policy.\nThe term of an appointment at the rank of instructor is one year, and no one may be appointed to more than three terms at this rank, whether consecutively or not. An instructor has the right to a decision, before the end of each term of appointment, regarding either reappointment - if not ruled out by this Policy - or promotion to the rank of assistant professor.\nThe term of an appointment at the rank of assistant professor is three years, and no one may be appointed to more than two terms at this rank, whether consecutively or not. An assistant professor has the right to a decision, before the end of a first term of appointment at this rank, on reappointment; and to a decision, before the end of a second term of appointment at this rank, on promotion, without indefinite tenure, to the rank of associate professor. If a tenure decision is made for an assistant professor (whether mandated by the tenure decision deadline or earlier), an affirmative decision must be accompanied by promotion.\nAn appointment at the rank of associate professor may be made with or without indefinite tenure. If it is made without indefinite tenure (whether by promotion or as an initial appointment) its term shall be determined so as to expire one year after the tenure decision deadline, as defined in the subsection on Tenure decisions of the present section of this Policy; if, when so determined, the term would exceed five years (which may occur if the appointment is an initial appointment or an early promotion), the term shall instead be five years. In this latter case, the associate professor has the right, if not granted tenure earlier, to a decision, before the expiration of the term, on reappointment, without indefinite tenure, for a term to be determined in the same manner.\nA promotion to the rank of professor may only be made with indefinite tenure. An initial appointment at the rank of professor is normally made with indefinite tenure. In exceptionally justified cases, such an initial appointment may, however, be made without indefinite tenure for a term of three years. In such an exceptional case, which must be particularly noted in the written notice of appointment, a tenure decision must be made during the second year of the term of appointment; if this tenure decision is negative, there will be no reappointment.\nIf, during the term of a faculty appointment without indefinite tenure at the rank of assistant professor or associate professor, circumstances provided for in the subsection on Tenure decisions of the present section of this Policy, and arising during the term in question, result in exclusions from current service for the purpose of determining the tenure decision deadline (see Exclusions from service in that subsection) that in the aggregate and after round-off equal or exceed one year, this term of appointment may be extended by one year by a decision made by the president acting upon the recommendation of the dean and subject to the agreement of the faculty member. In the case of an appointment at the rank of associate professor, if the cited exclusions from current service, computed in the same manner, equal or exceed two years, the term of appointment may be extended by two years by the same procedure. The extensions permitted by these provisions may be made in at most two terms, consecutive or not, of a person's appointment.\nTenure Decisions\nGeneral rules\nFor a faculty member holding an appointment without indefinite tenure other than one at the rank of instructor or a terminal appointment, a tenure decision must be made before a specified time, called the tenure decision deadline.\nFor an initial appointment without indefinite tenure at the rank of professor, the tenure decision deadline is the end of the second year of the three-year term of appointment (see the subsection on Terms of the present section of this Policy regarding this exceptional case). This case is excluded from the provisions in this subsection that determine the tenure decision deadline for all other cases.\nThe initial date for the determination of the tenure decision deadline is the commencement of an initial appointment at, or promotion to, the rank of assistant professor, or the commencement of an initial appointment at (or, exceptionally, a promotion from the rank of instructor to) the rank of associate professor, without indefinite tenure.\nBefore the initial date or within ninety days following the initial date, a number of years of previous service is determined according to the provisions of this subsection. This number must be stated explicitly in a written notice to the appointee; it may, to the extent that some of its components are subject to negotiation, as indicated below, be adjusted once, at the time of the first reappointment or promotion following the initial date.\nBeginning with the initial date, the number of years (in the sense of the definition in the subsection on Years of the present section of the Policy) is counted and may be adjusted by the exclusions permitted by the provisions of this subsection, resulting in an adjusted number of years of current service.\nThe tenure decision deadline is defined to be that 30 June at which the sum of the number of years of previous service and the adjusted number of years of current service reaches nine.\nIf the number of years of previous service determined for a proposed initial appointment equals or exceeds eight, such an initial appointment may not be made without indefinite tenure.\nPrevious Service\nThe number of years of previous service is determined by computing the following items.\n\nThe number of years of service under earlier regular faculty appointments at Carnegie Mellon at the rank of assistant professor or a higher rank must be included. (The meaning of the term year in this count is that defined in the subsection on Years of the present section of this Policy, or whatever meaning it had for purposes of faculty employment at the time of the appointments under consideration.)\nThe number of years of service under research faculty and\/or teaching track appointments at Carnegie Mellon at a rank equivalent to that of assistant professor or a higher rank must be included, except that one year of service at a rank equivalent to that of assistant professor may be excluded from the count. (The meaning of the term year in this count is the same as in item 1.)\nService under special faculty appointments at Carnegie Mellon that qualify by having a rank equivalent to that of assistant professor or a higher rank must be included, as follows: 100% of all time of service under qualifying special faculty appointments of category (A) - specifically including all appointments as visiting assistant professor, visiting associate professor and visiting professor - and 75% of all time of service under qualifying special faculty appointments of category (B) or (C). (The categories are defined in the university policy on Special Faculty Appointments.) Each college or school shall make rules to determine which special faculty appointments, other than those specifically listed above, are to be regarded as having a rank equivalent to that of assistant professor or a higher rank. The time of service is to be aggregated in 12-month years and fractions of such a year.\nTemporary part-time service at Carnegie Mellon at a rank equivalent to that of assistant professor or a higher rank may, by written agreement between the individual and the university, be included on a proportionate basis (for example, two 12-month years of half-time service may be counted as one 12-month year), up to a maximum resulting count of one 12-month year.\nService on the full-time teaching faculty of another four-year academic institution at the rank of assistant professor or a higher rank, as well as service in other academic institutions at an equivalent rank and with comparable responsibilities may, by written agreement between the individual and the university, be included, as a whole number of years up to a maximum of four years. (The meaning of year in this count is to be a reasonable interpretation of the usage at the relevant institution(s).)\n\nThe number of years of previous service is obtained by adding the numbers of years resulting from items 1 through 5 inclusive, a fraction of a year in the sum (resulting from items 3 and 4) being rounded off to the nearest whole number (if the fraction is exactly one-half of a year it is rounded down).\nWhen, in determining the number of years of previous service for an initial appointment at the rank of associate professor (or promotion from the rank of instructor to that rank), the number obtained in the preceding paragraph is less than three, the number of years of previous service is nevertheless deemed to be three for the purpose of determining the tenure decision deadline.\nExclusions from current service (\"Stopping the tenure clock\")\nThe university may adopt policies establishing criteria and procedures under which a faculty member without indefinite tenure may have certain periods of time excluded from current service for qualifying medical, family or public service reasons.\nWhen a leave of absence is granted for professional reasons, or for personal reasons not covered by policies referred to in the preceding paragraph, the faculty member and the university may agree, in writing, to exclude from current service a period no longer than the duration of the leave; but exclusions for this reason may not exceed two twelve-month years when aggregated.\nIf, upon the appointment of a faculty member without indefinite tenure (whether the appointment is an initial one or not), the university undertakes commitments in writing regarding space, equipment or other resources, and delays in fulfilling these commitments in such a way as to impair substantially the faculty member's ability to carry out the full range of his or her academic responsibilities, a period commensurate with the delay shall, upon the request of the faculty member and\/or the department head, be excluded from current service. The request shall be submitted, with the recommendations of the department head and the dean, to the provost for a final determination regarding the appropriateness of the exclusion, as well as its duration.\nThe exclusions from current service resulting from all the preceding provisions are aggregated. When using this aggregate exclusion for the determination of the tenure decision deadline, a fraction of a twelve-month year in the sum is rounded off to the nearest whole number (if the fraction is exactly one-half year it is rounded up).\nTimely Decisions\nA faculty member holding an appointment without indefinite tenure, other than a terminal appointment, has a right to a timely decision on reappointment, promotion or tenure, as is appropriate in each case under the provisions of the subsections on Terms and Tenure decisions of the present section of this Policy. A decision, whether affirmative or negative, becomes final upon ratification of the president's recommendation by the Board of Trustees; to be timely, it must be made and notified in writing to the faculty member before the expiration of the current term of appointment if it is a decision on reappointment or promotion and before the tenure decision deadline if it is a tenure decision. The president shall notify the faculty member of the decision in writing by first-class mail to his or her last known home address. Subject to the faculty member's acceptance, an affirmative reappointment decision becomes effective upon the expiration of the current term of appointment, and an affirmative promotion or tenure decision becomes effective on the 1 July immediately following the date of the decision.\nIn case a final decision is negative, the appointment shall continue, by means of a terminal appointment if necessary, until the later of: (a) the expiration of the current term of appointment; and (b) the 30 June (31 December if the expiring appointment is at the rank of instructor) next after the 1 July immediately following the notification of the decision.\nBefore the 31 January immediately preceding the time limit set above for a final decision, the president shall decide on his or her recommendation to the Board of Trustees and notify the faculty member of this recommendation in writing in the same manner as prescribed above. Upon the written request of the faculty member, the president shall provide a written statement of the reasons for the recommendation, provided the faculty member agrees in writing that the statement is confidential and may be used for no other purpose than to discuss the reasons with the department head, the dean, the provost or the president, if the faculty member so chooses, or to submit the statement to the Faculty Review Committee in support of a grievance arising out of a negative recommendation.\nA negative recommendation made by the president may also be brought promptly by the faculty member before the Faculty Review Committee in the form of a grievance alleging that the recommendation involves issues of academic freedom, improper procedure or discrimination on any of the impermissible grounds listed in the subsection on Faculty grievances of the section of this Policy entitled Faculty Review Committee. The procedure to be followed is described in the cited section. So long as this procedure has not been completed, the president's recommendation shall not be brought before the Board of Trustees for ratification. If the term of the faculty member's appointment would expire before that time, the appointment shall nevertheless continue at the same rank, until the final decision shall become applicable as if the expiring term had ended on the 30 June immediately following the date of the board's decision.\nAt any time during the process of making a decision on reappointment, promotion or tenure, and whatever the nature of the recommendations already made, the faculty member has the right to request in writing that the process be stopped. Such a request shall have the same effect as would a final negative decision of the Board of Trustees, made on the date on which notice of the request is received by the president.\nEarly Decision\nWith respect to a faculty member holding an appointment without indefinite tenure, other than a terminal appointment, a decision on promotion or a tenure decision may be initiated and made at any time before it is required by the provisions of the subsection on Timely decisions of the present section of this Policy. Similarly, a decision on promotion to the rank of professor may be made at any time. It is indeed the policy of Carnegie Mellon that a decision on promotion or a tenure decision be made as soon as the faculty member is judged to satisfy the criteria for the proposed promotion or for the granting of tenure, respectively, according to the provisions of the section of this Policy entitled Faculty Appointments: Criteria. A decision to reappoint at the rank of assistant professor (or, if permissible, at the rank of associate professor, without indefinite tenure) may, however, be neither made nor initiated before the next-to-last year of the expiring term of appointment.\nA negative decision regarding reappointment, promotion or the granting of tenure, if made early enough, shall not preclude the initiation and making of a later timely decision on the same issue. Moreover, with the exception noted in the next paragraph, the fact that there was a negative decision shall not be used to prejudice the process leading to such a later decision, nor shall any recommendations made in the earlier process be so used.\nThe process leading to an early decision is normally initiated by agreement between the faculty member and the department head. A faculty member has, however, the right to request on his or her own, at any time, the initiation of an early promotion or tenure decision or of a decision to promote to the rank of professor. Such a request must be made in writing. If the department head does not support the initiation of the process (whether he or she would recommend an affirmative decision or not), the request shall not be proceeded with unless the faculty member agrees in writing that, in the event of a negative decision, this decision as well as any recommendations that may be made in the process of reaching it may be taken into account in making a later decision on the same promotion or on tenure, as the case may be.\n\nFaculty Appointments:  Criteria\n\nGeneral Principles\nFaculty appointment and tenure decisions are governed by the contributions the candidate has made and is expected to make to the excellence of the university, the advancement of the candidate's academic field, the quality of education and the functioning and welfare of the university community. An affirmative decision on initial appointment, reappointment or promotion, or on the granting of tenure does not guarantee subsequent affirmative decisions. It should be noted that advancement of otherwise qualified candidates may be denied because of budgetary constraints or because their talents and interests do not sufficiently fulfill the needs or promote the goals and priorities of the university.\nCriteria\nThe evidence required for appointment and tenure decisions is conveniently organized under two categories: Teaching and Other Educational Activities; and Research, Scholarly or Artistic Activities. The specific designation of activities in each of these categories, the weight given to each activity within its category, and the nature of the required documentation will vary between one college or school and another. Each college and school has its Appointment and Tenure Policy (see the subsection on College and School Policies of the section of the present Policy entitled Faculty Appointments: Procedures), containing the detailed criteria to be used in making recommendations on appointment and tenure decisions and describing the required documentation. These provisions should conform to the following description.\nTeaching and Other Educational Activities\nTeaching, a principal function of the faculty, is direct educational involvement with students inside or outside the classroom, laboratory or studio, and includes such activities as classroom, laboratory or studio instruction, seminars, independent study project supervision and supervision of graduate and postdoctoral research. It also includes the advising of undergraduate and graduate students.\nCompetence in teaching should be documented by means including colleague evaluations and meaningful student evaluations obtained through surveys and solicited and unsolicited written opinions.\nOther educational activities include development of new or reformed courses, curricula, degree programs and training programs; educational publications, textbooks and other instructional materials; and technical and critical popularization.\nResearch, Scholarly or Artistic Activities\nResearch, scholarly or artistic activities are those activities that lead to the production of new knowledge; to increased problem-solving capabilities, including design and analysis; to original critical or historical theory and interpretation; or to the production of art or artistic performance.\nCompetence in the activities of this category should be documented by the record of accomplishment, including publications, commissions, inventions and works of art; the record of recognition, including awards, prizes, honors from professional societies, exhibitions and critical reviews of publications, artistic production and research proposals; and the considered opinions of outstanding experts in the candidate's field, both inside and outside the university.\nAs the level of the decision rises, considered opinions of outside experts carry increasing weight. Requiring outside opinions is optional for decisions on initial appointment or reappointment at the rank of instructor, on promotion to the rank of assistant professor or on reappointment at the rank of assistant professor.\nOther Considerations\nCandidates for appointment and tenure decisions may also carry out professional activities that should be considered: e.g., professional practice, consulting, public service, service in professional and technical societies and editorial work on professional journals and other publications. Insofar as such activities either contribute to, or are an extension of, either of the two categories of activities described earlier in this subsection, they should be considered when evaluating qualifications under each of these two categories.\nIt is expected that every faculty member will contribute, by means of his or her expertise and the commitment of reasonable time and effort, to the functioning and welfare of the university community, and of his or her academic unit in particular, through such activities as chairing or serving on committees and councils, providing professional supervision of educational, research and other scholarly university resources, etc. Quality of contributions in this area of Service is to be considered (as well as substantial failure to attend to it), in addition to the main two categories of activities described above.\nApplication of Criteria\nFor initial appointment, reappointment and promotion at all ranks, competence is required, at a level appropriate to the respective stage of the candidate's career, both in Teaching and Other Educational Activities and in Research, Scholarly or Artistic Activities. For the granting of tenure (including initial appointment with indefinite tenure), the candidate must in addition be outstanding, or show promise to be outstanding, in at least one of the two categories by demonstrating a high level of capability in the production, dissemination or application of knowledge or esthetic experience.\nThe preceding provisions notwithstanding, there should always be room in the university for an individual so exceptionally outstanding in either Teaching and Other Educational Activities alone, or Research, Scholarly or Artistic Activities alone, with qualifications meeting the needs and promoting the goals of the institution, that he or she should clearly be appointed, retained or promoted.\nThe following provisions are intended to clarify the expectations associated with certain decisions.\nA candidate for initial appointment at, or promotion to, the rank of associate professor should have a record of accomplishment that indicates clearly that he or she is a potential leader who in due time will be sufficiently well established to deserve promotion to the rank of professor.\nIndefinite tenure is granted to a candidate whose record shows that the leadership and reputation inherent in the attributes of a full professor are established or are clearly in the process of being established.\nA candidate for initial appointment at, or promotion to, the rank of professor should be very well established in his or her field. The successful candidate will usually be a recognized leader who has made outstanding contributions in teaching and other educational activities or in research, scholarly or artistic activities, and has achieved a national or international reputation.\nThe Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college and school (see the subsection on College and School Policies of the section of the present Policy entitled \"Faculty Appointments: Procedures\") may specify more in detail the application of criteria to the making of recommendations on appointment and tenure decisions, within the provisions of this subsection.\n\nFaculty Appointments:  Procedures\n\nGeneral Rules\nThis section prescribes the procedure to be followed in providing the president with the advice and recommendations necessary for the formulation of the president's recommendation to the Board of Trustees on each appointment or tenure decision (other than a decision to make a terminal appointment). In preparing this recommendation, the president may request any additional advice that he or she considers appropriate.\nThere are two degrees of thoroughness of the procedure, depending on the nature of the decision. A summary procedure is prescribed for: initial appointment and reappointment at the rank of instructor; initial appointment at, and promotion to, the rank of assistant professor; and transfer appointment, without promotion, of a faculty member already appointed with indefinite tenure. A comprehensive procedure is prescribed for all other cases, viz.: reappointment at the rank of assistant professor; initial appointment and reappointment at, and promotion to, the rank of associate professor; initial appointment at, and promotion to, the rank of professor; and all tenure decisions. The procedures for dealing with joint appointments are prescribed in the subsection on Joint Appointments of the present section of this Policy.\nEach appointment decision and each tenure decision is initiated in a college or school according to the procedures prescribed in that unit's Appointment and Tenure Policy (see the subsection on College and School Policies of the present section of this Policy). The procedure in the college or school ends with a recommendation by the dean, submitted to the provost together with the complete documentation of the case, including all internal recommendations by faculty, department head and appropriate committees.\nIf a summary procedure is prescribed, the provost forwards the dean's recommendation with the accompanying documentation to the president, together with his or her own recommendation.\nIf a comprehensive procedure is prescribed, the provost submits the dean's recommendation together with the accompanying documentation to the appropriate University Committee on Faculty Appointments, as provided in the subsection on University Committees of the present section of this Policy. This University Committee makes its recommendation to the provost, who forwards it, together with all the documentation and with his or her own recommendation, to the president.\nIn the case of the proposed initial appointment without indefinite tenure at the rank of associate professor of a person who is not at the time a full-time employee of Carnegie Mellon University, the provost may, nevertheless, make his or her recommendation to the president without first obtaining a recommendation from the University Committee, unless the provost determines that the case, as presented and documented by the dean, appears to raise significant concerns regarding the appropriateness of the appointment. When a recommendation by the University Committee has thus not been required, the case shall be reported to the Committee for its information.\nIf the president disagrees with the recommendation of the University Committee, he or she shall inform the Committee of the reasons for the disagreement and provide it with an opportunity to respond, before formulating the final recommendation to the Board of Trustees. The contents of this final recommendation shall in any event be reported by the president to the members of the University Committee.\nUniversity Committees\nResponsibilities\nThere are two University Committees on Faculty Appointments, viz., the University Committee on Faculty Appointments Without Indefinite Tenure and the University Committee on Faculty Appointments With Indefinite Tenure (called the University Non-Tenure Committee and the University Tenure Committee for short, respectively). These are standing committees. Their functions are:\n\nTo provide the provost and the president with recommendations on all appointment decisions requiring a comprehensive procedure (see the subsection on General Rules of the present section of this Policy) and on all tenure decisions.\nTo review the Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college and school (see the subsection on College and School Policies of the present section of this Policy), to monitor the procedures for appointment and tenure decisions in the colleges and schools and to recommend changes where inadequacies exist. In this function, the University Committees advise the respective colleges and schools and, if appropriate, communicate their concerns and recommendations to the provost and to the Faculty Senate.\n\nThe responsibilities for making recommendations on promotion decisions requiring a comprehensive procedure and on tenure decisions are assigned as follows between the two University Committees.\nThe University Non-Tenure Committee makes recommendations on reappointment at the rank of assistant professor and, when appropriate under this Policy, at the rank of associate professor when made without indefinite tenure; and on initial appointment at, and promotion to, the rank of associate professor when made without indefinite tenure.\nThe University Tenure Committee makes recommendations on all tenure decisions; on initial appointment at, and promotion to, the rank of associate professor when made with indefinite tenure; and on initial appointment at, and promotion to, the rank of professor (including the exceptional case of initial appointment at that rank without indefinite tenure).\nWhen it is proposed to make an initial appointment at, or promotion to, the rank of associate professor with indefinite tenure, the University Tenure Committee makes the recommendation, but may instead recommend (taking the place of the other University Committee) that the proposed initial appointment or promotion be made, but without indefinite tenure, if such an appointment is permitted under the provisions of this Policy.\nComposition\nEach of the two University Committees on Faculty Appointments is constituted as follows:\n\nThe provost, who presides. In the absence of the provost, a dean designated by the provost presides.\nThe dean of each of the colleges and schools. If unable to attend a meeting of the committee, a dean may appoint a full professor in the respective college or school to be a substitute member for that meeting.\nThree faculty members appointed by the chair of the Faculty Organization and two faculty members appointed by the provost. For the University Non-Tenure Committee, each of these members should be an associate professor (a professor only if no associate professor is available), with no restriction regarding academic unit; for the University Tenure Committee, each of these members should be a (tenured) professor.\nOne faculty member appointed by the chairman of the faculty of each college or school; if a college or school has, at the time the appointment is to be made, no chairman of the faculty, this member shall be appointed by the chair of the Faculty Organization in consultation with the dean of the college or school. For the University Non-Tenure Committee, this member should be an associate professor without indefinite tenure (a tenured associate professor only if none without indefinite tenure is available) in the respective unit; for the University Tenure Committee, this member should be a tenured faculty member in the respective unit.\n\nThe mode of appointment of each committee member in items 3 and 4 is the responsibility of the person designated to make the appointment. These members are appointed for staggered two-year terms beginning on 1 July and ending on 30 June, but continuing to serve until a replacement has been appointed. A vacancy is filled by appointment for the remainder of the unexpired term.\nCollege and School Policies\nPolicies\nBecause of the diversity of academic environments and faculty activities in the university's colleges and schools, each of these units has a document, here called that college's or school's Appointment and Tenure Policy, describing its own detailed criteria and methods for evaluating each candidate for an appointment or tenure decision, within the provisions of the section of the present Policy entitled Faculty Appointments: Criteria; and providing for procedures for the consideration of appointment and tenure decisions leading to recommendations forwarded by the dean, as prescribed in the subsection on General Rules of the present section of this Policy.\nThe Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college or school must conform to the provisions of the present university Policy; to the extent of any inconsistency between a college's or school's policy and this university Policy, the latter shall prevail.\nThe Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college or school is established, and amended as needed from time to time, by the respective college or school council with the approval of the dean, and with opportunity given for consultation with the faculty of the respective unit. The policy is subject to review by the University Committees on Faculty Appointments (see the subsection on University Committees of the present section of this Policy), in particular on the occasion of an amendment.\nProcedure\nWith regard to the procedure to be followed in the consideration of appointment and tenure decisions, the Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college or school should provide for deliberate examination of candidate qualifications and for due attention to the philosophy and direction of the educational and scholarly or artistic programs of the college or school and of the relevant department. To that end, the policy should require effective participation of the department head and of the departmental faculty of the appropriate rank and tenure status in formulating departmental recommendations, including, if appropriate, the opinion of departmental committees. The departmental process should also provide for reasonable opportunities for the expression of opinion on the decision by other faculty members (including research faculty) and, if appropriate, of graduate and undergraduate students.\nFor those appointment or tenure decisions for which a comprehensive procedure is prescribed by the provisions of the subsection on General Rules of the present section of this Policy, the Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college or school should further require:\n\nEffective participation by the dean and by the department heads in the college or school, as well as by faculty members of the appropriate rank and tenure status and of expertise representing the breadth of the college's or school's academic activities, through standing and\/or ad-hoc college- or school-wide committees.\nDetailed reports supporting the recommendations of the department as well as of the college- or school-wide committees, to be forwarded together with the dean's own recommendation to the provost for further action.\n\nFor all appointment and tenure decisions, the faculty member shall be notified promptly in writing of the departmental recommendation by the department head and of the dean's recommendation by the dean. Upon the written request of the faculty member, the department head or the dean, as the case may be, shall provide a written statement of the reasons for the recommendation, provided the faculty member agrees in writing that the statement is confidential and may be used for no other purpose than to discuss the reasons with the department head, the dean, the provost or the president, if the faculty member so chooses, or to submit the statement to the Faculty Review Committee in support of a grievance arising eventually out of a negative recommendation by the president to the Board of Trustees.\nWhen a college or school is not organized by departments, the Appointment and Tenure Policy of that unit should provide procedures that ensure the same degree of deliberation and breadth of consultation prescribed in the preceding paragraphs.\nIn addition to prescribing the procedures to be used in the consideration of promotion and tenure decisions, the Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college or school should contain provisions ensuring that every faculty member of a rank other than that of professor is annually given reasonably reliable and detailed information on his or her performance in relation to the department's and the college's or school's goals and resources, and with a view to the prospect of a reappointment, promotion or tenure decision, as appropriate in each case.\nJoint Appointments\nGeneral rules Joint appointments are defined in the subsection Types of Appointment of the section of this Policy entitled Faculty Appointments: Term of Appointment and Timing of Decisions. The present subsection deals only with joint appointments that are made in more colleges or schools than one. The Appointment and Tenure Policy of each college or school may contain provisions regarding that college's or school's participation in such joint appointments, as well as provisions for joint appointments between departments in that college or school, all subject to conformity with the provisions of the present Policy.\nIn order to avoid repetitions, and in this subsection on \"Joint appointments\" only, the term unit is restricted to mean \"college or school,\" and joint appointment is from here on restricted to mean \"joint appointment in more units than one.\"\nThe provisions of this subsection are formulated, for convenience, for appointments involving two units; but they are to be regarded as applying, with the obvious required changes, to appointments involving more than two units.\nThe unit having the greater percentage of the salary-and-commitment distribution of a joint appointment is the home unit; but if the distribution is equal or nearly so, the choice of home unit may be dictated by other considerations, and is made by agreement between the units and the faculty member.\nA faculty member holding a joint appointment has, in both units participating in the appointment, all the rights and privileges pertaining to faculty members in that unit of the same rank and tenure status; except that the right to vote in faculty decisions in the non-home unit may be subject to restrictions established in the Appointment and Tenure Policy of that unit, provided such restrictions are equal for all joint appointees with the same rank and tenure status and the same percentage of the salary-and-commitment distribution in the unit in question.\nFor the purpose of determining the procedures regarding joint appointments, these are classified as major joint appointments if the percentage of the salary-and-commitment distribution in the home unit does not exceed 75%, and as minor joint appointments otherwise (the latter kind includes those appointments with a 100%-0% distribution). A deviation from this threshold percentage may, under exceptional circumstances documented in writing, be approved by the provost for a specific appointment, acting on the concurrent recommendations of the deans of the units involved, and subject to the agreement of the faculty member.\nMinor Joint Appointments\nIn all appointment and tenure decisions regarding a minor joint appointment, the participation of the non-home unit shall be by way of consent; a decision regarding consent shall follow the summary procedure prescribed for appointment decisions by that unit's Appointment and Tenure Policy according to the provisions of the subsection on College and School Policies of the present section of this Policy. In particular, when a decision on reappointment, promotion or the granting of tenure is to be made regarding an existing minor joint appointment, the decision shall be made as if the appointment were in the home unit exclusively; if the decision is affirmative, the resulting appointment shall be held in the home unit exclusively, unless the non-home unit gives its consent, with the agreement of the faculty member and the dean of the home unit, to making the resulting appointment again a minor joint appointment. The consent of the prospective non-home unit is also required when making an initial appointment as a minor joint appointment.\nA decision to convert an appointment in one unit into a minor joint appointment with that unit as home unit, or to convert a minor joint appointment into an appointment in the home unit exclusively, or to make changes in the salary-and-commitment distribution of a minor joint appointment that do not convert it into a major one, is not regarded as an appointment decision requiring the approval of the Board of Trustees if it is to go into effect during the term of the existing appointment. Such a decision is made by written agreement between the deans of the units, the relevant department heads, and the faculty member, and does not affect the then current term of appointment; but the first of these decisions also requires the consent (as defined in the preceding paragraph) of the prospective non-home unit.\nMajor Joint Appointments\nWhen making an appointment decision or a tenure decision regarding a major joint appointment, the appropriate procedure, whether summary or comprehensive, prescribed in the subsection on General Rules of the present section of this Policy, shall be followed in both units involved and in the university. For an initial appointment, the deans of the units involved must make concurrent affirmative recommendations. For all other decisions, the deans should endeavor to make their recommendations concurrent. In order to facilitate the reaching of concurrent recommendations, it is required that the procedure involve at least one recommendation from a standing or ad-hoc joint committee of both units. As an alternative to a recommendation for an affirmative or a negative decision, the deans may recommend that the decision be to reappoint, promote or grant tenure - as the case may be - in one of the units exclusively.\nA decision to convert an appointment in one unit into a major joint appointment between that unit and another, to take effect during the term of the existing appointment, shall require, in addition to the agreement of the dean of the first unit, the department head in that unit, and the faculty member, an affirmative recommendation by the dean of the second unit, made after following the procedure prescribed in that unit for appointment decisions: a summary procedure if the faculty member is an instructor or is an assistant professor who has not been reappointed or if the current appointment is with indefinite tenure, and a comprehensive procedure in all other cases. The decision shall become final upon the approval by the provost, who must obtain the opinion of the appropriate University Committee on Faculty Appointments if a comprehensive procedure was prescribed. Such a decision is not regarded as an appointment decision requiring approval by the Board of Trustees. The same provisions apply to the conversion of a minor joint appointment into a major one with the current home unit as one of the prospective participating units.\nA decision to convert a major joint appointment into a minor one or into an appointment in one of the participating units exclusively, if it is to go into effect during the term of the existing appointment, may be made by agreement between the deans of the units, the relevant department heads, and the faculty member.\nIn none of the cases provided for in the preceding two paragraphs does the decision affect the current term of appointment.\nUniversity Professors\nGuidelines for Appointment\nForeword\nThe rank of University Professor is the highest one at Carnegie Mellon University, and it bestows both honor and obligation onto its recipient. University Professors should be drawn from all of Carnegie Mellon University's colleges and schools. These guidelines for nominating a University Professor describe a process that is intentionally similar to that of other academic promotions.\nCriterion\nInternational recognition and distinction for contributions to education, artistic creativity and expression and\/or research.\nDistinction may be demonstrated in a variety of ways consistent with the highest standards of the University. Recognition should reflect exceptional achievements at Carnegie Mellon that extend beyond the candidate's department and college. Recognition may also be demonstrated in part by election to an academy or by the highest honors or award given by the candidate's professional organizations.\nEligibility for Nomination\nAll current faculty members holding the rank of Professor and, excepting special circumstances, having held that rank for a minimum of five years at Carnegie Mellon University are eligible for promotion to the rank of University Professor.\nLimitation\nThe number of University Professors should be no more than about 10 percent of number of faculty at Carnegie Mellon University holding the rank of Professor. Each year, the Provost will determine the maximum number of faculty members that may be elected.\nEmeritus Faculty\nAn emeritus faculty member may, if he or she chooses, continue to hold the rank of University Professor after retirement. However, on retirement, this faculty member will no longer be counted when determining limits.\nAn emeritus faculty member may be elected to the rank of University Professor, but, when this unusual step is taken, this election counts against the limit for that year.\nNomination and Election Process\nThe Provost, University Professors, Deans and Departments Heads may nominate candidates. The Provost will request nominations early in the new school year and will determine the maximum number of persons who may be elected that year - subject to the restriction that there will be at least one position. The Provost will announce the deadline dates for the nomination process. A suggested timetable is for Letters of Intent to be submitted by the end of October and for final nomination packages by the end of January. The process will involve two steps.\n1. Letter of intent\n\nTwo or more nominators will prepare a signed letter of no more than one page indicating the intent to prepare a nomination. This letter should indicate the basis for the intended nomination. The nominator(s) will send this letter plus the proposed candidate's CV to the Provost.\nThe Provost will appoint a subcommittee consisting of about five University Professors to review the letters of intent and then to select those for whom full nomination packages may be prepared. The Provost will chair this subcommittee and will be a voting member.\nThe Provost will inform the nominators as to whether or not they should proceed with the full nomination.\n\n2. Nomination\n\nThe nominators will prepare a full nomination package, consisting of a signed cover letter not to exceed two pages, the CV of the candidate, and, at their discretion, not more than five support letters.\nThe Provost will appoint a committee of approximately three persons from among the University Professors to review each candidate. This committee may solicit additional input. It will prepare a short report on its findings and recommendations.\nThe Provost will call a meeting of the University Professors to review the nomination packages and committee findings and recommendations and then vote on the candidates. The Provost will appoint one of the University Professors to chair this meeting. The Chair of the election meeting will forward the proposed set of elected candidates to the Provost along with a record of the number voting for, abstaining and voting against each candidate.\nThe President and the Provost along with the Board of Trustees will determine who among these candidates will be promoted to University Professor.\n\n\nFaculty Review Committees\n\nConcept and Functions\nThere shall be a Faculty Review Committee consisting of faculty members chosen by the Faculty Senate, on behalf of the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University, for the high regard in which they are held by the Carnegie Mellon community.\nThe functions of the Faculty Review Committee are the following:\n\nThe dismissal for cause of a faculty member, or the imposition of sanctions on a faculty member, requires concurrent findings by the president and the Faculty Review Committee that this measure is justified on one or more of the grounds listed in the section of this Policy entitled Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions. That section contains the pertinent substantive and procedural provisions for the exercise of this function.\nThe Faculty Review Committee has the power to review the president's recommendations on appointment and tenure decisions, as well as decisions on working conditions, that are alleged by an aggrieved faculty member to involve issues of academic freedom, improper procedure or discrimination on any of the impermissible grounds listed in the subsection on Faculty Grievances of the present section of this Policy.\nThe Faculty Review Committee may render advisory opinions on matters regarding policies affecting the faculty and the generic implementation of these policies, as provided for in the subsection on Advisory Opinions of the present section of this Policy.\n\nComposition\nThe Faculty Review Committee shall consist of eleven members. To be appointed a member and to retain membership, a person must hold a regular faculty position with indefinite tenure and may not hold an administrative appointment.\nThe term of office of members of the Faculty Review Committee is one year, beginning on 1 July and ending on 30 June of the next calendar year or on the date the newly appointed members take office, if later; except in the cases of members appointed to fill vacancies or co-opted to secure a quorum for specific matters before the Committee, as provided for in this subsection.\nThe members of the Faculty Review Committee, other than those appointed to fill vacancies or co-opted to secure a quorum, are elected by the Faculty Senate, all at the same time, according to the procedures prescribed in the Constitution of the Faculty Organization of Carnegie Mellon University and its Bylaws (herein referred to as the Faculty Constitution and Bylaws ). These documents may, but need not, provide for a system of partial automatic extension of service that is intended to produce a pattern of staggered longer-term Committee membership.\nA vacancy in the membership of the Faculty Review Committee, caused by resignation or by loss of qualifications for membership or otherwise, shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by appointment by the Faculty Senate or by its Executive Committee according to the procedures prescribed by the Faculty Constitution and Bylaws.\nWhen a matter regarding a dismissal for cause, sanctions, or a faculty grievance comes before the Faculty Review Committee, Committee members who have had a significant prior involvement with the matter in question, or who have a personal relationship with any of the parties directly involved in the matter, shall recuse themselves from participating in the proceedings regarding it. Neither shall any member appointed to fill a vacancy on the Committee after the matter has come before it participate in those proceedings, unless co-opted to secure a quorum under the provisions of this subsection.\nWhen any matters regarding dismissal for cause, sanctions, or faculty grievances are pending before the Faculty Review Committee at the time when the term of office of its members would expire, the Committee shall continue as then constituted for the sole purpose of disposing of such pending matters in its jurisdiction, notwithstanding the appointment of a new Faculty Review Committee in the regular manner at the same time.\nThe exercise of the functions of the Faculty Review Committee requires the participation of a quorum of eight members of the Committee. In all cases, however, every member of the Committee who is neither recused nor excused by the Committee at his or her request for serious reasons has the obligation to participate in, and the right to be informed in a timely manner of, all Committee proceedings.\nIf the quorum specified in the preceding paragraph is not attained, the remaining Committee members qualified to participate in the proceedings in question shall co-opt, in whatever manner they shall determine, additional members to the Committee for the sole purpose of achieving the specified quorum for the matter or matters then before the Committee. The persons co-opted must be chosen among former members of the Faculty Review Committee who remain qualified to serve on it under the provisions of this subsection and of the Faculty Constitution and Bylaws. If a quorum cannot be attained even in this manner, the additional members required to achieve the quorum shall be chosen by lot by the chair of the Faculty Organization from among the persons qualified to be co-opted under the preceding provision.\nRules\nThe exercise of the functions of the Faculty Review Committee, as well as its internal organization and procedures (including, if appropriate, the selection of a chairman and the appointment of subcommittees) shall be governed, insofar as the matter is not prescribed by this Policy or by the Faculty Constitution and Bylaws, by rules adopted by the Faculty Review Committee itself. The making of these rules, as well as of every other decision mandated or explicitly authorized by this Policy to be made by the Faculty Review Committee, requires the approval of a majority of the members of the Committee entitled to participate in this decision, unless otherwise explicitly provided in this Policy.\nFaculty Grievances\nA faculty member may bring before the Faculty Review Committee, in the form of a grievance, an allegation that the president's recommendation to the Board of Trustees regarding an appointment or tenure decision concerning him or her, or the process leading to that recommendation, involves issues of\n\nacademic freedom; or\nimproper procedure, including improper application of criteria; or\ndiscrimination on grounds of race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, religion, creed, belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related handicap.\n\nA grievance may also be brought before the Faculty Review Committee by a faculty member who alleges that an administrative decision regarding working conditions, such as salary, assignment of teaching duties, space and other matters affecting the conduct of his or her professional duties, involves issues listed in items 1, 2, or 3 above.\nWhen a grievance on any one or more of these grounds is submitted, the grievant shall present all factual or other data that he or she deems pertinent to the case, as well as all the relevant documentation available to him or her. The Faculty Review Committee shall have access to all the relevant documentation under the control of the university in the same manner and to the same extent as had the administrators and committees or other faculty bodies that participated in the decisions or recommendations to which the grievance refers, and with the same obligation of confidentiality that these administrators, committees or bodies were under with regard to any particular document.\nWhen a grievance is submitted, the Faculty Review Committee shall first decide whether the allegations and the evidence submitted by the grievant merit detailed consideration of the matter, and shall inform the grievant and the appropriate administrator(s) promptly of this decision.\nIf the Faculty Review Committee decides that detailed consideration of a grievance is in order, it shall so notify the provost and the grievant's dean and department head, and shall expeditiously investigate the matter in the manner that it deems appropriate. If the Committee finds that there are grounds for a formal hearing, it shall conduct such a hearing under the same procedural safeguards prescribed for hearings in cases regarding dismissal for cause or other sanctions in the subsection on Procedure of the section of this Policy entitled Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions. The Faculty Review Committee, in carrying out its investigation, may appoint ad-hoc committees of investigation, reporting to it, and consisting of faculty members with indefinite tenure who may, but need not, be members of the Faculty Review Committee.\nIn determining whether a decision or recommendation that is the subject of a grievance was affected by improper procedure with regard to the application of criteria employed in arriving at it, the Faculty Review Committee may examine whether the decision or recommendation by an administrator, committee or other faculty body was the result of adequate consideration in terms of the relevant standards of the institution; but it shall not substitute its judgment on the merits of the case for that of the maker(s) of the decision or recommendation.\nIf the Faculty Review Committee concludes, after detailed consideration of a grievance, that the allegations in it have been established in full or in part, the Committee has the power to require of the maker(s) of the decision or recommendation that is the subject of the grievance that he or she or they reconsider this decision or recommendation to the extent that it is affected by the established allegations. When requiring reconsideration of a decision or recommendation, the Committee may choose to offer advice on how to structure the reconsideration so as to prevent a repetition of the errors that justify the grievance. In the case of an appointment or tenure decision, the Committee's advice should take into account the existing appointment and tenure policies of the grievant's college or school.\nThe conclusion of the Committee, its findings and, if appropriate, its decision to require reconsideration - which must include the grounds for this decision - shall be recorded in a report. This report shall be provided to the grievant and the maker(s) of the questioned decision or recommendation, as well as to the president, the provost and the grievant's dean and department head. This report shall also be kept in the permanent files of the Faculty Review Committee. The Committee's obligation of confidentiality extends to the contents of this report.\nThe outcome of a reconsideration required by the Faculty Review Committee shall be promptly reported to the Committee.\nAdvisory Opinions\nThe Faculty Review Committee may render advisory opinions on matters regarding policies affecting the faculty and the generic implementation of these policies, but only either at the request of the president or of the chair of the Faculty Organization, or on the Committee's own initiative. Such advisory opinions are not binding, nor do they constitute binding precedents for the Committee's own future proceedings.\nWhen an opinion is requested, the Faculty Review Committee may decline to render one, and need not give a reason for declining. The Committee must decline to render a requested opinion, and must abstain from rendering one on its own initiative, if it appears to the Committee that the opinion would have a direct bearing on a specific matter that is likely to come before the Committee in its function regarding proceedings for dismissal for cause or for other sanctions.\n\nDismissal for Cause and other Sanctions\n\nDismissal for Cause\nA person holding a faculty appointment with or without indefinite tenure may be dismissed for cause from employment by the university only on one or more of the following grounds:\n\nsubstantial neglect of duties;\ndemonstrable incompetence;\nmoral turpitude;\nviolation of the criminal law that places the institution or members of the university community in jeopardy;\npersistent and willful violation of standards of faculty conduct; these standards are set forth in the subsection on Standards of Faculty Conduct of the section of this Policy entitled Principles.\n\nTo dismiss a faculty member for cause, there must be concurrent findings by the president and the duly constituted Faculty Review Committee (as provided for in the section of this Policy entitled Faculty Review Committee) that this action is justified on one or more of the grounds listed above, and these findings must have been arrived at by following in good faith the procedures prescribed in the subsection on Procedure of the present section of this Policy. For the dismissal to become effective, these findings must be concurred in and approved by the Board of Trustees.\nShould the charges aimed at the dismissal for cause of a faculty member appear to the president to involve gross misconduct, meaning that they are of such gravity and of such a nature as to render the person unfit for continuing association with students, or to constitute an immediate and substantial danger to life or to property of the university or of members of the university community, the president may, at the time he or she initiates the process aiming at dismissal by formulating those charges or at any later time during the process, suspend the faculty member with pay.\nA dismissal becomes effective when notice of the final decision of the Board of Trustees is given to the dismissed faculty member by the president in writing by first-class mail to his or her last known home address. The dismissed faculty member shall continue to receive his or her salary, at the rate in effect immediately before the date of the decision of the Board of Trustees, until the earliest of: (a) the date on which the term of appointment then in effect would have expired (if the appointment was one without indefinite tenure); (b) the expiration of one twelve-month year from the date of the decision by the Board of Trustees; (c) the commencement of other employment. If, however, the president and the Faculty Review Committee, in concurring in the finding that dismissal is appropriate, agree that gross misconduct by the faculty member (as defined above) has been established, and the Board of Trustees concurs, the dismissed faculty member shall not be entitled to receive any salary after the dismissal has become effective.\nSanctions\nSanctions other than dismissal may be imposed on a faculty member only on the same grounds listed in the subsection on Dismissal for Cause of the present section of this Policy, or for knowingly committed violations of standards of faculty conduct that are not of such gravity or of such a nature as to merit dismissal. Such sanctions shall be imposed by the president with the concurrence of the Faculty Review Committee after following in good faith the procedures prescribed in the subsection on Procedure of the present section of this Policy.\nSanctions that may be imposed in this manner include, but are not limited to: reduction in salary; embargo on the consideration of salary increases for a specified period of time; prohibition of proposing, through the university, some or all sponsored research or other grants for a specified period of time; censure; public apology to the university community. A sanction consisting in excluding a faculty member without indefinite tenure from consideration for reappointment or promotion at the expiration of the current term of appointment or from consideration for tenure requires, in addition, the approval of the Board of Trustees.\nThe imposition of a sanction is not a subject of public announcements, as provided for in the subsection on Publicity of the present section of this Policy. When the very nature of the sanction requires disclosure (e.g., censure, public apology), the disclosure shall be made only to the extent strictly required. However, the fact that a sanction has been imposed, and the grounds therefor, documented by the final Faculty Review Committee report in which the Committee concurred in the relevant finding, shall be made known to those directly participating in any appointment or tenure decision process for the sanctioned faculty member, and the nature and the gravity of the established charges leading to the sanction are a legitimate consideration in formulating recommendations regarding the appointment or tenure decision as well as in making the decision itself.\nProcedure\nInitiation\nA procedure aimed at dismissing a faculty member for cause or at imposing other sanctions on him or her shall be initiated only by the president after consultation with the appropriate department head(s) and dean(s), and with one or more university officers.\nThe decision of the president to initiate the procedure may be preceded in some cases, when permitted or required under policies established by the university, by a formal process of inquiry, or of inquiry and investigation.\nThe president shall initiate the procedure by communicating to the faculty member in writing a summary statement of the grounds on which a dismissal for cause or the imposition of another sanction is sought, as well as the specific nature of the proposed sanction, and advising the faculty member of the procedure to be followed and of the options available to him or her.\nSuspension\nIf the evidence leading the president to initiate a procedure for the dismissal for cause of a faculty member appears to the president to involve gross misconduct, as defined in the subsection on Dismissal for cause of the present section of this Policy, the president may, when initiating the procedure or at any later time during the procedure, suspend the faculty member with pay. The suspension shall become effective upon notification in writing to the faculty member. The Faculty Review Committee shall be informed of the suspension. A suspension may be revoked by the president at any time. If not revoked earlier, a suspension shall remain in effect until the final disposition of the initiated procedure.\nAd-Hoc Committee\nImmediately after the president has initiated the procedure for dismissal for cause or for other sanctions, the chair of the Faculty Organization shall, at the request of the president, appoint an Ad-Hoc Committee charged with rendering confidential advice regarding the substance of the initiated procedure. However, the faculty member, upon being notified of the initiation of the procedure, may waive in writing the appointment of the Ad-Hoc Committee; in that case the procedure continues at once with the formal statement of charges, as provided for below.\nThe Ad-Hoc Committee shall consist of three members, who shall be current or retired regular faculty members of Carnegie Mellon University who are or have been members of a University Committee on Faculty Appointments and who hold no administrative appointment nor are currently members of the Faculty Review Committee.\nThe Ad-Hoc Committee shall immediately carry out an informal inquiry into the matter giving rise to the initiated procedure, with a view to exploring the possibility of an adjustment. It may make recommendations on such an adjustment to the president and the faculty member; such recommendations are not binding. The Committee shall have thirty days, from the date of its appointment, to carry out this part of its function, but the president and the faculty member may agree to an extension of not more than fifteen days.\nIf no adjustment is recommended or, if one is recommended, it is not accepted by the president and the faculty member, the Ad-Hoc Committee may make a recommendation to the president on the advisability of pursuing the initiated procedure, as well as on the nature of the proposed sanction; but the Ad-Hoc Committee may also decline to make such a recommendation. The proceedings of the Ad-Hoc Committee must be completed no more than sixty days after the initiation of the procedure by the president.\nAny recommendation made by the Ad-Hoc Committee shall be communicated to the president, the faculty member and the Faculty Review Committee.\nExceptions\nCertain university policies permit or require a formal investigation of allegations of faculty conduct that, under the provisions of the present section of this Policy, may be grounds for dismissal for cause or other sanctions. Any such policy may specify conditions under which, after such an investigation of a faculty member's conduct, a decision by the president to initiate against that faculty member the procedure for dismissal for cause or for other sanctions shall not be followed by the appointment of an Ad-Hoc Committee under the preceding provisions.\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, the president shall record that fact in the communication to the faculty member that initiates the procedure. The president may then proceed, not earlier than seven days nor later than fifteen days after initiating the procedure, with the formal statement of charges, as provided for below.\nStatement of Charges\nWithin the time prescribed in the immediately preceding paragraph when the provision under the heading \"Exceptions\" above applies, and otherwise within fifteen days of the completion of the proceedings of the Ad-Hoc Committee, or if the communication to the president of the faculty member's waiver of the appointment of an Ad-Hoc Committee, the president, if he or she has decided to continue the initiated procedure, shall communicate to the faculty member in writing a statement of charges, which is a formal statement specifying the grounds upon which dismissal for cause or the imposition of sanctions is sought, the particular charges made on those grounds, the proposed disposition (dismissal for cause or another specific sanction), the detailed procedure to be followed and the procedural rights accorded to the faculty member.\nIf the charges in a procedure for dismissal for cause involve gross misconduct, as defined in the subsection on Dismissal for Cause of the present section of this Policy, the statement of charges shall include a declaration to this effect, whether the president has, in consequence of these charges, suspended the faculty member or not.\nThe statement of charges shall in particular inform the faculty member that a hearing on the charges will be conducted by the Faculty Review Committee at a specified time and place. The time of the hearing shall be set no earlier than thirty days nor later than forty-five days after the communication of the statement of charges, unless the chairman of the Faculty Review Committee arranges a reasonable extension of the latter time that is agreeable to the president and the faculty member.\nNo later than ten days before the date set for the hearing, the faculty member should respond in writing to the statement of charges, in order to answer the charges made there; at that time, the faculty member may also indicate whether he or she waives the holding of the hearing before the Faculty Review Committee.\nFaculty Review Committee Procedure\nThe president shall promptly provide the Faculty Review Committee with the statement of charges and with the faculty member's response to it, and the Committee shall begin its examination of the case by considering these documents. Whether a hearing is to be held or the holding of a hearing is waived by the faculty member, the Faculty Review Committee may request relevant information from any person it considers appropriate, and it shall have access to all the relevant documentation under the control of the university.\nIf the Faculty Review Committee requests it, the university shall retain independent counsel of the Committee's choice to assist it in conducting its investigation of the case.\nIf a hearing is to be held, it is the faculty member's privilege to decide whether the hearing shall be private or open to the university community. If any facts are in dispute, the testimony of witnesses and other evidence concerning the charges in the president's statement of charges shall be presented at the hearing.\nThe president or a university officer of the president's choice may attend the hearing in person, and the president may designate a representative to assist in developing the case. The Faculty Review Committee, however, determines the order of proof, conducts the questioning of witnesses, secures, if necessary, the presentation of relevant evidence and controls the course of the hearing. Neither the president nor any other administrator shall attempt to influence the Faculty Review Committee except through argument openly presented at the hearing or in written documents readily available to the faculty member.\nThe faculty member shall have the option of assistance by counsel, whose function shall be similar to that of the president's representative. The Faculty Review Committee shall assist the faculty member, if necessary, in securing the attendance of witnesses at the hearing. The faculty member and his or her counsel, as well as the president's representative, shall have the right, within reasonable limits set by the Committee, to question all the witnesses who testify in person at the hearing. The faculty member has the right to be confronted by all witnesses testifying in support of the charges. When a witness is unable to appear at the hearing, a sworn deposition, made in the presence of the faculty member and his or her counsel, who shall have the right to question the witness, may be admitted as evidence. All the evidence admitted shall be duly recorded, and a transcript of the hearing shall be prepared.\nUnless special circumstances warrant in the opinion of the Faculty Review Committee, it shall not be necessary to follow formal rules of court procedure at the hearing.\nAfter the Faculty Review Committee has collected all the evidence, whether a hearing has taken place or holding a hearing has been waived, the Committee shall hear oral arguments by the president's representative and by the faculty member and his or her counsel. The Committee may also request written briefs if it regards them as being potentially helpful to its deliberations.\nFaculty Review Committee Decision\nThe Faculty Review Committee shall make its decisions in conference on the basis of the evidence collected and the arguments of the president's representative and of the faculty member and his or her counsel. The Committee may proceed to a decision promptly, without awaiting a transcript of the hearing, if one was held, when the Committee members unanimously agree that the Committee is able to reach a just decision in this way; otherwise, the Committee shall await the availability of a transcript of the hearing.\nOn each of the charges contained in the president's statement of charges, the Faculty Review Committee shall decide (a) whether it finds that the charge is contained within one or more of the grounds listed in the subsections on Dismissal for Cause and Sanctions of the present section of this Policy, and, if so, (b) whether it concurs in the president's finding that the charge has been established. Unless the Committee's decision is affirmative on both points with respect to at least one charge, it shall exonerate the faculty member.\nAn affirmative decision on any of the points referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be reached if and when agreed on by members equaling or exceeding in number two-thirds of the total number of members participating in the consideration of the case (as determined according to the rules in the subsection on Composition of the section of this Policy entitled Faculty Review Committee).\nIf the Faculty Review Committee does not exonerate the faculty member, it shall then decide whether it concurs in the disposition proposed by the president, viz., dismissal for cause or some other specific sanction. The Committee may, instead, decide to make a reasoned proposal of a sanction less severe than that proposed by the president, or for a sanction equally severe but, in the Committee's judgment, more appropriate to the case; it may not propose a sanction more severe than that proposed by the president.\nIf in the statement of charges the president makes a charge of gross misconduct by the faculty member, as defined in the subsection on Dismissal for Cause of the present section of this Policy, the Faculty Review Committee, if and when concurring in the finding that one or more of the charges have been established and are properly grounded, shall also decide on whether it agrees that gross misconduct has been established. An affirmative Committee decision on this point necessarily implies concurrence in the president's finding that dismissal for cause is justified.\nA decision by the Faculty Review Committee to concur with a proposal by the president to dismiss the faculty member for cause, or a decision to agree that gross misconduct has been established, shall be reached if and when agreed on by members equaling or exceeding in number two-thirds of the total number of members participating in the consideration of the case. Every other Committee decision on sanctions, referred to above, shall be reached if and when agreed on by a majority of the members participating in the consideration of the case.\nAll the decisions of the Faculty Review Committee required by the preceding provisions shall be recorded, together with a reasoned statement of opinion, in a Faculty Review Committee report that shall be communicated to the president and to the faculty member. Both shall also be provided with a copy of the transcript of the hearing, if one was held.\nAppeal for Reconsideration\nIf the Faculty Review Committee does not exonerate the faculty member, he or she may lodge an appeal for reconsideration. Such an appeal may also be lodged by the president in all circumstances after receiving the Faculty Review Committee report.\nFor an appeal for reconsideration to be heard, written notice of the intention to appeal must be given to the president and the chairman of the Faculty Review Committee within ten days of the communication of the Faculty Review Committee report, and the appeal itself, with reasons given in detail, must be lodged with the president and the chairman of the Faculty Review Committee within twenty days of the communication of that report.\nWhen notice of the intention to appeal for reconsideration is received, the president shall constitute an Appeal Committee to hear the appeal. The Appeal Committee shall consist of two deans chosen by lot among the deans of the colleges and schools, but excluding the dean of any college or school in which the faculty member holds an appointment; two members appointed by the chair of the Faculty Organization, chosen among those current or retired faculty members of Carnegie Mellon University who are former members of the Faculty Review Committee and do not hold administrative positions; and, to be chairman of the Appeal Committee, a member of the Board of Trustees appointed by the chairman of the Board of Trustees.\nWhen hearing an appeal for reconsideration, the Appeal Committee shall review all the proceedings in the case and shall provide an opportunity for oral or written argument by the president or his or her representative and by the faculty member and his or her counsel. The Appeal Committee has the power to require the Faculty Review Committee to reconsider its decisions on those points and in response to those objections specified by the Appeal Committee. A decision to require reconsideration shall be made only if supported by the votes of at least three members of the Appeal Committee. The decision of the Appeal Committee, whether to require or not to require reconsideration, shall be communicated to the president, the faculty member, and the chairman of the Faculty Review Committee.\nWhen required to reconsider its decisions, the Faculty Review Committee shall proceed to do so by taking into account the stated objections, and receiving new evidence and hearing new argument if necessary. It shall then make its decisions on the reconsidered points by the same procedure as before, and shall record them in an appropriately confirmed or amended report, herein referred to as the final Faculty Review Committee report. The report shall be communicated to the president, the faculty member and the members of the Appeal Committee.\nIf no appeal for reconsideration is lodged, or if one is lodged but the Appeal Committee does not decide to require reconsideration, the president shall so inform the faculty member, and the Faculty Review Committee report as originally prepared becomes the final Faculty Review Committee report.\nDisposition\nIf the final Faculty Review Committee report exonerates the faculty member, the procedure shall terminate without further action, except as regards the disposition of the records, as provided below.\nIf the final Faculty Review Committee report records concurrence by the Faculty Review Committee in a finding by the president that dismissal for cause is justified, the president shall submit these concurrent findings to the Board of Trustees for the Board's concurrence and approval. If, in addition, the final Faculty Review Committee report records agreement by the Faculty Review Committee with the president that gross misconduct by the faculty member has been established, the president shall also submit this agreement to the Board for the Board's concurrence and approval.\nIn every other case, the final Faculty Review Committee report will record concurrence by the Faculty Review Committee in a finding by the president that at least one of the charges in the statement of charges has been established and is properly grounded, and the report will either agree with the president's proposal for a specific sanction other than dismissal for cause, or else will propose a sanction less severe than that proposed by the president (which latter may even have been dismissal for cause) or one equal in severity to that proposed by the president. In each case, the president shall then impose the less severe of the sanctions proposed by him or her and by the Faculty Review Committee; if they are of equal severity, the president shall impose whichever of the two proposed sanctions he or she considers more appropriate. When a sanction to be imposed requires, however, the approval of the Board of Trustees under the provisions of the subsection on Sanctions of the present section of this Policy, the president shall impose this sanction only after obtaining that approval.\nIf the disposition of the case requires the approval of the Board of Trustees, the president's decision to submit the case to the Board shall be communicated at once to the faculty member, to allow him or her to present to the Board, in writing, any arguments he or she considers appropriate to influence the Board's final decision.\nWhen the president submits to the Board of Trustees a decision to dismiss a faculty member for cause, or a decision to impose a sanction that requires the approval of the Board, and the Board does not approve the proposed decision, the president may impose any sanction less severe than the one disapproved by the board (after obtaining the Board's approval if the intended substitute sanction requires it).\nIn every case in which the final Faculty Review Committee report does not exonerate the faculty member, the president shall report the disposition of the case to the Faculty Review Committee and record that disposition in the records of the case.\nCommunications and Notifications\nAll communications and notifications addressed to any person by the president or by the Faculty Review Committee regarding or related to a procedure aimed at the dismissal for cause of, or the imposition of other sanctions on, a faculty member shall be made in writing by first-class mail to the addressee's last known home address.\nRecords\nWhen the procedure ends with the exoneration of the faculty member, or with an informal agreement before a decision by the Faculty Review Committee, all records of the case under the control of the university, including those under the control of the Faculty Review Committee, shall be destroyed no earlier than thirty nor later than forty-five days after the outcome is communicated to the faculty member. At the faculty member's request, in writing, submitted within fifteen days of receipt of that communication, the president shall address to the faculty member a letter identifying the charges and describing the findings in the final Faculty Review Committee report or the contents of the agreement, as the case may be. This letter shall be available for responsible use at the faculty member's discretion. It shall not be included in the personnel file unless such inclusion is requested, in writing, by the faculty member. The president's letter must be formulated, and used by the recipient, so as to preserve the confidentiality of the process, and shall in particular include only information already disclosed to the faculty member.\nIf the final Faculty Review Committee report does not exonerate the faculty member, and whatever the final disposition of the case, all records pertaining to the case, with the exception noted below, that are under the control of the university shall be kept only by the Faculty Review Committee, for whatever length of time is necessary to satisfy legal requirements for the protection of the faculty member, the university and all persons participating in the decision leading to that disposition (including witnesses testifying at a hearing or by deposition); but never for less than three years from the date of the final disposition of the case. At the expiration of that length of time, the records shall be destroyed.\nIf the final disposition of the case is the imposition of a sanction other than dismissal for cause, the following documents pertaining to the case shall be made part of the faculty member's personnel record, and kept there so long as he or she is employed by the university, and destroyed upon the termination of employment: the statement of charges, the final Faculty Review Committee report, and the final decision imposing the sanction.\nPublicity\nDismissal for cause of a faculty member is an extreme measure, undertaken only for the protection of the university and of the members of the university community. It is not the purpose of the proceedings leading to this measure to subject the dismissed faculty member to public censure or to compromise unduly the possibility of his or her employment elsewhere. For this reason, hearings are private unless the faculty member decides that they should be open to the university community; nor is any public announcement made of the initiation of the procedure aiming at dismissal for cause, of any later stages of the procedure or of the final disposition of the case, unless the faculty member specifically requests, in writing addressed to the president, that a public announcement be made. Upon such a request, the president shall cause an appropriate announcement to be made to the faculty in a circular or in a faculty bulletin; the announcement of a dismissal for cause shall include summary statements of the charges and of the decisions of the Faculty Review Committee, the president and the Board of Trustees.\nThe same provisions shall apply, with the obvious necessary adjustments, to procedures aimed at the imposition of sanctions other than dismissal for cause; except that when the nature of the sanction itself requires disclosure (e.g., censure, public apology) the fact that the sanction was imposed and a summary of the established charges shall be disclosed only to the extent strictly necessary. The availability of information on the imposition of a sanction to the persons directly involved in making recommendations on appointment and tenure decisions regarding sanctioned faculty members is provided for in the subsection on Sanctions and in Records in the subsection on Procedure of the present section of this Policy.\nIf a public statement about a case is made by the faculty member concerned or by any other person while the proceedings are still in progress or after they are concluded, the president shall have the right to a public reply.\n\nAppendix: Notices\n\nNotices of Appointment [pdf]\nFaculty appointment without indefinite tenure.\nFaculty appointment with indefinite tenure.\nNotice of Number of Years of Previous Service [pdf]\nTenure decision deadline: Notice of number of years of previous service.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Inspection\nWhat are education records?\nEducation records are records maintained by the university that are directly related to students. These include biographic and demographic data, application materials, course schedules, grades and work-study records. The term does not include:\n\ninformation contained in the private files of instructors and administrators, used only as a personal memory aid and not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record;\nCampus Police records;\nemployment records other than work-study records;\nmedical and psychological records used solely for treatment purposes;\nrecords that only contain information about individuals after they have left the university;\nany other records that do not meet the above definition of education records.\n\nHow do I inspect my education records?\n\nComplete an Education Inspection and Review Request Form\u00a0[PDF] and return it to The HUB in order to notify the University Registrar's Office.\nThe custodian of the education record you wish to inspect will contact you to arrange a mutually convenient time for inspection, not more than 45 days after your request. The custodian or designee will be present during your inspection.\nYou will not be permitted to review financial information, including your parents' financial information; or confidential letters of recommendation, if you have waived your right to inspect such letters.\nYou can get copies of your education records from the office where they are kept for 25 cents per page, prepaid.\n\n2.

If your attorney will be present, you must notify the university ten days in advance of the hearing so that the university can arrange to have an attorney present too, if desired.\nThe university will inform you of its decision, in writing, including a summary of the evidence presented and the reasons for its decision, no later than 45 days after the hearing.\nIf the university decides not to amend the record, you have a right to add a statement to the record that explains your side of the story.\n\n4. Disclosure\nCarnegie Mellon generally will not disclose personally identifiable information from your education records without your consent except for directory information and other exceptions specified by law.\nWhat is directory information?\nDirectory information is personally identifiable information of a general nature that may be disclosed without your consent, unless you specifically request the university not to do so. It is used for purposes like compiling campus directories.\nIf you do not want your directory information to be disclosed, you must notify the University Registrar's Office, in writing, within the first 15 days of the semester.\nNotifying the University Registrar's Office covers only the disclosure of centralized records. Members of individual organizations such as fraternities, sororities, athletics, etc. must also notify those organizations to restrict the disclosure of directory information.\nCarnegie Mellon has defined directory information as the following:\n\nyour full name\nlocal\/campus address\nlocal\/campus telephone number\nemail user id and address\n\n(User ids cannot be completely suppressed from our electronic systems. While it may be possible to suppress the association of an individual's name with their user id, doing so may adversely impact the delivery of electronic mail or other electronic services.)\n\nmajor, department, college\nacademic advisor name\nclass status (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, undergraduate, or graduate)\ndates of attendance (semester begin and end dates)\nenrollment status (full, half, or part time)\ndate(s) of graduation,\ndegrees awarded\nsorority or fraternity affiliation\n\nFor students participating in intercollegiate athletics, directory information also includes:\n\nheight, weight\nsport of participation\n\nWhat are the other exceptions?\nUnder FERPA, Carnegie Mellon may release personally identifiable information from your education records without your prior consent to:\n\nschool officials with legitimate educational interests (\"School officials\" are Carnegie Mellon employees in administrative, supervisory, academic or support staff positions; Carnegie Mellon trustees; individuals and companies with whom the university has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using university employees such as attorneys, auditors, or collection agencies; and individuals assisting school officials in performing their tasks. School officials have a \"legitimate educational interest\" if they need to review an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibilities.);\ncertain federal officials in connection with federal program requirements;\norganizations involved in awarding financial aid;\nstate and local officials who are legally entitled to the information;\ntesting agencies such as the Educational Testing Service, for the purpose of developing, validating, researching and administering tests;\naccrediting agencies, in connection with their accrediting functions;\nparents of dependent students (as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Service Code);\ncomply with a judicial order or subpoena (after making a reasonable effort to notify the student in advance of compliance so that the student can take protective action, except in cases where the university is legally required not to disclose the existence of the subpoena);\nappropriate parties in a health or safety emergency, if necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals;\nofficials of another school in which the student seeks or intends to enroll;\nvictims of violent crimes or non-forcible sexual offenses (the results of final student disciplinary proceedings);\nparents or legal guardians of students under 21 years of age (information regarding violations of university drug and alcohol policies);\ncourts (records relevant to legal actions initiated by students, parents or the university);\ncomply with federal laws concerning sex offenders and other individuals required to register under section 170101 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n\n5. Complaints\nIf you believe the university has not complied with FERPA, you can file a complaint with the:\nFamily Policy Compliance Office Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.

PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this Business and Travel Expense Policy (Policy) is to provide departments, supervisors, employees and non-employees with specific policies and procedures regarding Carnegie Mellon University (university) business and travel expenses.\u00a0 Business expenses include those that are directly paid (e.g., purchasing card) as well as expenses reimbursed to individuals who incur them on behalf of the university.\u00a0\nThe primary emphasis of this Policy is on business and travel expense reimbursements because those expense reimbursements are the focus of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accountable plan rules.\nBusiness and travel expenses (including amounts allowable as per diems) that are reimbursed following IRS accountable plan rules are not subject to income or employment taxes (e.g., federal income tax withholding, social security taxes or Medicare taxes).\nVery generally, the following are the IRS requirements for tax-free reimbursements of expenses under an appropriate accountable plan:\n\nThere must be a business connection for the expense and the expense must be reasonable and necessary.\nThere must be a reasonable accounting for the expense.\nAll excess reimbursements must be repaid within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe IRS has issued a number of regulations which further define these requirements and this Policy is designed to meet them.\u00a0\nB. WHO SHOULD READ THIS POLICY?\n\nEmployees who incur expenses on the university's behalf, including through use of the university purchasing card and other direct payment mechanisms.\nEmployees who travel on university business.\nEmployees who supervise employees incurring university business expenses.\nEmployees who make travel and other arrangements or prepare expense transactions for:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - University employees; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Prospective university employees; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - University visitors; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Students who travel on approved university business; or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - University-sponsored conventions, conferences, or seminars.\n\nNon-employees (this includes but is not limited to visitors, recruits, independent contractors, consultants, students, and courtesy appointments) who travel for university-related business or incur expenses for which the university has agreed to pay.\n\nC. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nThe university pays for business and travel expenses incurred in connection with university business that are appropriately documented and are in accordance with IRS accountable plan rules.(See Reporting Requirements.) In instances where expenses do not satisfy the requirements of the IRS accountable plan rules, the individual may, among other things, be taxed on those expenses.\nThe basic premise governing business and travel expenses is that an individual should neither gain nor lose funds in the course of conducting university business.\nBecause it is not possible to anticipate all of the circumstances that individuals may encounter in conducting university business, it is expected that those requesting reimbursement or incurring business or travel expenses and individuals preparing and approving expenses for payment will follow this Policy in a manner that keeps expenses to a minimum and fairly assigns the costs of business-related activities to the university.\nAssuming a reasonable level of safety and convenience for the individual, every effort should be made to keep university business and travel expenses to a minimum.\nAll expenses must have a valid business purpose. The university will not reimburse or pay for expenses that are inherently personal in nature. Below are some examples of personal expenses:\nPersonal grooming services, such as barbers, hairdressers, toiletries, and shoe shines;\nChild care costs, babysitting, and house-sitting costs;\nPet care, including fees for boarding pets and other animal care;\nAny personal clothing and accessories;\nPrescriptions, over-the-counter medication, and other medical expenses;\nPersonal reading material, such as non-scholarly magazines, books and newspapers;\nPersonal recreation or entertainment such as greens fees, sightseeing fares, theater tickets, entry fees, lift tickets, etc.;\nCredit card delinquency fees and finance charges;\nDues in private clubs;\nGym and recreational fees, including massages, manicures\/pedicures and saunas;\nAmenities such as movies, in-room bars, saunas, massages, etc.;\nPersonal insurance costs such as life insurance, business travel accident insurance, personal automobile insurance and baggage insurance;\nLost baggage;\nLoss or theft of travel advance money, airline tickets, personal funds and other personal property; and\nParking tickets or traffic violations.\n\nThe university will not pay for or reimburse business or travel expenses that have been or will be reimbursed from any outside sources (other than expenses for which the university will be reimbursed under agreements such as grants or sponsored project agreements).\nSince departments govern how authorization for business and travel expenses is granted, departments may elect to impose additional restrictions over expenses beyond those required by this Policy for various business reasons, including budget availability.\u00a0 \u00a0\nA per diem travel allowance for meals and\/or lodging is available for travel by Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff and student employees, but is not permitted for non-employees.\u00a0 Per diem reimbursement is not available for student employees who are being reimbursed for academic expenses not related to their employment.\u00a0\nThe university will not provide travel advances, pay directly or make reimbursements for the travel expenses of companions\/spouses or non-employees who accompany faculty or other employees on university business, except in limited circumstances (See Companion\/Spousal Travel and Business Expenses).\n\nCAUTION: \u00a0Expenses that may be reasonable and necessary business expenses per this Policy may be unallowable for Federal, state or other sponsored reimbursement, either directly or indirectly.\u00a0 Individuals incurring expenses or requesting reimbursement from agency or other sponsored funds should consult agency guidelines and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures and restrictions are followed.\u00a0 Any questions about the interpretation of agency or sponsor procedures or restrictions should be directed to the designated departmental finance representative and\/or the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.\u00a0\nD. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\nIRS accountable plan rules require the university to maintain a policy under which employees and non-employees must account for all business and travel expenses, advances, and allowances. The accounting must include:\n\nsufficient information to establish a valid business purpose of the travel, entertainment, or other business expense;\nsubstantiation of the business and\/or travel expense with required original receipts and an adequate record of each expense indicating the amount, date and place for all expenses of $75 or more.\u00a0 If alcohol is included in the receipt total, it must be identified and reported separately. (Note: Departments may request detail for expenses below $75 for additional departmental internal control purposes.); and\nthe prompt return of any unused monies from travel advances (See Travel Advances).\n\nIn order to avoid having the reimbursement be taxable to the individual, expenses should be submitted within 30 days of completing the travel or incurring the expense.\u00a0 \u00a0Reimbursement of expenses must be submitted into Oracle within 90 days after completing the travel or incurring the expense; otherwise, this will result in the reimbursement being taxable to the individual.\nE. ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY\nPrimary responsibility for compliance with this Policy rests with the individuals requesting reimbursement or incurring the business expense and the departments and supervisors who are authorizing and approving these business and travel expenses.\nThe responsibilities are defined as follows:\nIndividual Requesting Reimbursement or Incurring the Business Expense\nThe individual requesting reimbursement or incurring the business expense may delegate responsibility for preparation of the expense transaction but, in doing so, the individual retains accountability.\u00a0 Individuals requesting reimbursement or incurring the business expense are responsible for ensuring the following:\n\nThe expense has a valid business purpose;\nProper business justification and supporting documentation (e.g., receipts)\u00a0 have been obtained and\/or provided to the business expense preparer;\nProper approval for upgrades and exceptions has been obtained and has been provided to the business expense preparer;\nA valid Oracle account number(s) has been provided to allocate the expenses;\nTo the best of the individual\u2019s knowledge, the expense is in compliance with this Policy and if the expense is to be charged to a sponsored award, that the expense is in compliance with all sponsor requirements\/Federal regulations.\n\nBusiness Expense Preparer\nThis individual is responsible for preparing the expense and, by submitting, is confirming the following:\n\nProper business justification and supporting documentation (e.g., receipts) have\u00a0been received from the individual requesting reimbursement or incurring the\u00a0business expense;\nMileage and per diem calculations are accurate;\nProper approval for upgrades and exceptions has been obtained and submitted by\u00a0the individual requesting reimbursement or incurring the business expense;\nThe expense has been properly allocated to the Oracle account number(s).\n\nBusiness Expense Approver\nThis individual is responsible for approving the expense transaction and, by approving, is verifying the following:\n\nThe expense has a valid business purpose;\nThere is proper supporting documentation (e.g., receipts) for the business expense;\nMileage and per diem calculations are accurate;\nThere is proper department approval for upgrades and exceptions;\nThe expense has been properly allocated to the correct Oracle account number(s);\nTo the best of the approver\u2019s knowledge, the expense complies with this Policy and if the expense is to be charged to a sponsored award, that the expense is in compliance with all sponsor requirements\/Federal regulations.\n\nPermitted exceptions to this Policy may only be granted by the president, the provost, the\u00a0department\u2019s dean, a vice president, or the designated departmental finance representative. Thedesignated departmental finance representative must be designated by the department and the\u00a0department must notify Finance of the department\u2019s designation. These exceptions should bedocumented and submitted where appropriate.\nF. SHARING EXPENSES WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS\nIndividuals are responsible for seeking reimbursement for expenses payable by external\u00a0organizations. If an individual is taking a trip that will be paid by Carnegie Mellon and an external\u00a0organization, Carnegie Mellon will pay its agreed upon share of the actual expenses necessary for\u00a0university business. When an external organization pays for actual expenses incurred for lodging or\u00a0meals, the individual may not claim per diem. The reimbursement received by the individual from\u00a0all sources can never exceed the total expenses incurred by the individual.\nWhen expenses are being shared with external organizations and the expense report justification\u00a0field contains a detailed explanation of which organization is paying the balance of the expenses, a\u00a0duplicate copy of the receipts will suffice for reimbursement.\nG. PURCHASING CARD\nThe Policy applies to all business expenses incurred utilizing the university Purchasing Card.\u00a0Cardholders should also refer to the Purchasing Card Guidelines included in the Purchasing Manual\u00a0to familiarize themselves with what is and is not allowable to be purchased using the Purchasing\u00a0Card.\nH. SALES TAX INFORMATION\nAs a nonprofit organization, the university has been granted exemption from state sales tax on\u00a0goods and services purchased in certain states. Generally, in order for a purchase to be exempt\u00a0from sales tax, the business purchase must be made directly with university funds (e.g., a university\u00a0check, purchase order or purchasing card) and the university\u2019s sales tax exemption certificate must\u00a0be provided to the vendor at the time of purchase. When sales tax relating to business or travel\u00a0expenses is erroneously paid directly with university funds, it is the designated departmental\u00a0finance representative\u2019s responsibility to determine if the university, working through the Taxation\u00a0Department, should seek a refund of the sales tax that was paid. Questions regarding the possibility\u00a0of obtaining a refund for sales tax paid should be directed to the Taxation Department.\nSales tax incurred with personal funds for university business travel and for business meals will be\u00a0reimbursed. Sales tax incurred with personal funds for other business purchases should include a description supporting the business purpose as to why the sales tax was paid and may be\u00a0reimbursed subject to approval by the designated departmental finance representative.\nThe sales tax exemption does not apply to hotel occupancy taxes, the Allegheny County alcohol\u00a0beverage tax, locations that are outside of the United States, and in some states.\u00a0To obtain a copy of the relevant university\u2019s sales tax exemption certificate or for additional information or questions regarding sales tax, please contact the Taxation Department.\nI. INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AND SPONSORED GRANTS AND CONTRACTS\nThe university maintains branches or similar types of operations in various foreign (i.e., non-United\u00a0States) countries. The majority (or all) of the university\u2019s foreign branches or operations are\u00a0funded in whole or in part by a foreign sponsor pursuant to an agreement between the university\u00a0and the foreign sponsor (and the foreign sponsor may also be an agency of the foreign government\u00a0in which the branch or other operations are located).\nA particular travel or business expense that is not treated as income for United States personal income tax purposes may be treated as income for personal income tax purposes in the country or\u00a0locality in which the foreign branch or location is based, and vice versa, for employees and others\u00a0who are based at that foreign branch or location due to the tax and compensation and benefits laws\u00a0of that country or location. For example, a tax-free reimbursement of moving expenses in the\u00a0United States may be taxable for personal income tax purposes in a foreign location. As a result,\u00a0employees and others based at one of the university\u2019s foreign branches or operations may have\u00a0different personal income tax consequences than that specified in this Policy.\nBusiness or travel expenses funded by a sponsored grant or contract may also have additional\u00a0requirements, or may be subject to additional restrictions or limitations, than that required by this\u00a0Policy. For example, alcohol and tobacco are not permissible expenses to be charged to the Qatar\u00a0entity. The individual requesting reimbursement should consult the sponsoring agency guidelines\u00a0and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures and restrictions are\u00a0followed. Any questions or interpretation of Federal or sponsor restrictions should be directed to\u00a0the designated departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored\u00a0Projects Accounting Office or Office of International Finance.\n\nII.

INSURANCE, TRANSPORTATION, AND PARKING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Business Travel And Accident Insurance\nThe university provides business travel and accident coverage for all active full time faculty and staff members (and all part-time employees working at least seventeen and one-half (17.5) hours per week) on university approved and directed business travel.\u00a0\nSpecific questions regarding the university's business travel and accident insurance coverage should be directed to the Benefits Office.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Using Preferred Travel Agencies\nTo assist university travelers, the university has entered into agreements with several preferred travel agencies that provide the university with competitive fares, high-quality service, and convenience for university travelers.\u00a0 These travel agencies are set-up to bill the university directly for the cost of airfare, rather than the individual paying the cost personally and needing to be reimbursed.\u00a0 Like all other business expenses, all travel is subject to budgetary availability.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air Transportation\nFederal law (the Fly America Act) states that Federal awardees and others performing Federal government air travel between the United States and a foreign country or between foreign countries should generally use United States flag carriers to the maximum extent.\u00a0 This requirement is not affected by factors of cost and\/or convenience.\u00a0\nThe practices specified by the Fly America Act may differ among Federal agencies.\u00a0 Accordingly, individuals traveling abroad whose travel will be charged to a Federal grant or contract should consult agency guidelines to ensure that all agency procedures and restrictions are followed.\u00a0 Any questions or interpretation of Federal regulations should be directed to the designated Departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office. \u00a0\nIt is the responsibility of the traveler to use a personal credit card when making travel arrangements outside of the university's preferred travel agencies, if this is permitted by the external sponsor. Reimbursement for airfare purchases made with a personal credit card should be made only after proof of payment has been submitted with the expense report.\u00a0 In cases where individuals are requesting reimbursement prior to the trip, the department is responsible for ensuring that the trip occurred.\u00a0\nClass\nThe class of air travel chosen is expected to be the lowest-priced coach airfare ticket available using a commercial discount or coach class or standard accommodations.\nThe traveler may be reimbursed for business class when permitted by the sponsoring agency (if applicable) and the approval has been obtained by the designated departmental finance representative.\u00a0\u00a0 For airline tickets funded by a sponsored grant or contract, the individual requesting reimbursement should consult agency guidelines and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures and restrictions are followed.\u00a0 Any questions or interpretation of Federal or sponsor restrictions should be directed to the designated departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.\nIn some cases, premium (e.g., first class, business class) fares may be an appropriate business expense subject to budget availability and approval by the president, the provost, the department's dean, a vice-president, or the designated departmental finance representative.\u00a0 Examples include but are not limited to the following:\n\nOvernight \"red-eye\" flights;\nFlights exceeding eight (8) continuous hours.\n\nTravelers are encouraged to request pre-approval for premium fares and must follow departmental guidelines\/procedures.\nFrequent Flyer Plans\nTravelers may personally retain frequent flyer plan rewards or other bonuses that may accrue from business travel. However, in no case may the traveler choose a reservation at a higher cost in order to accumulate additional plan rewards. The university will not purchase frequent flyer miles from travelers or reimburse them for tickets purchased with frequent flyer miles. \u00a0Any membership fees to join frequent flyer clubs are considered personal expenses and will not be reimbursed by the university.\u00a0\nAirport Airline Club Memberships\nDues for memberships in airline clubs are personal expenses and are not reimbursable.\nBaggage\nCharges by airlines for checked baggage when traveling on University business are a reimbursable business expense.\nExcess baggage expenses are reimbursable in any of the following circumstances:\n\nTraveler is transporting university materials;\nTraveler is on an extended period of travel;\nDepartment has approved of the charge.\u00a0  \n\nUpgrades\nA request for reimbursement for an upgrade for seats, premium boarding, etc. must include a description supporting the business purpose as to why the upgrade was appropriate and must be approved by the individual's supervisor and designated departmental finance representative.\nParking\nAirport or other business parking will be reimbursed, but travelers are urged to use long-term, lower-cost parking lots when available. \u00a0If public transportation or a cab taken to and from the airport or other business location would result in a lower cost (due to the high cost of parking in most cities and airports), the traveler is encouraged to take advantage of these savings.\nEarly Departure or Late Return\nAdditional costs incurred for early departure or late return are not reimbursable unless the savings in airfare is equal to or greater than the total costs for lodging, meals, etc. incurred during the additional days of travel. It is appropriate to consider other relevant costs and factors against the savings in airfare, including the inherent cost of being out of the office for a longer period of time.\u00a0 Early departure and late return costs must be approved by the designated departmental finance representative.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nLost Luggage\/Items\nThe university does not maintain any lost luggage\/items insurance coverage for any loss of personal belongings of its employees while on university business travel.\u00a0 University employees are encouraged to make their own arrangements for this type of insurance coverage either through their personal homeowners\/renters insurance company or with their travel agent at the time of travel.\u00a0 The university will reimburse for this type of insurance only if there is a valid business purpose and the expense is approved by the designated departmental finance representative.\u00a0\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Automobile Travel\nPersonal Automobiles\nWhen the use of a personal automobile is necessary for university business, reimbursement for its use will be made at the mileage rate published by the IRS. \u00a0Employees at international locations may be required to adhere to country specific mileage rates and should consult their local business office with questions.\u00a0\nIt is the responsibility of the traveler to ensure that the proper mileage rate is being used and the distance is based upon actual driving distance using the most direct route.\u00a0 The mileage reimbursement rate covers reimbursement for use of the vehicle as well as any repairs, gas charges, and the owner's personal automobile insurance coverage, which provides the coverage in case of an accident. Tolls and parking fees are reimbursable. The university will not reimburse employees for parking tickets, fines for moving violations, vehicle towing charges, or auto repairs and maintenance.\nRental Cars\nRental of vehicles for university business use should be arranged through the university's preferred suppliers.\nStandard vehicles are the recommended vehicle size for rental purposes.\u00a0 Upgrades to full-size cars are permissible if the individual's designated departmental finance representative provides approval, \u00a0a detailed explanation (e.g., number of persons, luggage accommodations) is included in the business justification and it is an allowable cost by the governmental sponsoring agency (if applicable).\u00a0 \u00a0In addition to the payment for the cost of the rental car, the only other permissible expense for rental cars in most cases is the cost to purchase any gasoline.\nVehicles rented for university business purposes for less than thirty (30) days are considered short-term rentals by the university's current automobile insurance carrier. Coverage of short-term rentals under the university's automobile insurance policy is subject to the following conditions:\n\nAll drivers of rental vehicles must be over the age of twenty-one (21).\n\nAny rental vehicle that has a value over $75,000 must be specifically scheduled with the Risk Management Office prior to the start of the lease\/rental agreement.\n\nCoverage under the university's automobile insurance policy is only provided for vehicles rented in the United States, the territories and possessions of the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada.\n\nRented vehicles should be leased as:\u00a0 Carnegie Mellon University - (name of faculty, staff, or student).\n\nIndividuals renting vehicles for more than thirty (30) days should contact the Office of Risk Management Office to confirm applicable insurance coverage.\n\nUnited States and its Territories and Possessions, Puerto Rico and Canada Vehicle Rentals:\nThe insurance coverages below should not be purchased by those traveling in the United States, any territory or possession of the United States, Puerto Rico or Canada. The university already maintains automobile liability insurance within these countries and territories. Costs for the following coverages will not be reimbursed:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a.\u00a0 Loss Damage Waiver\/Collision Damage Waiver;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b.\u00a0 Liability insurance supplement\/Additional Liability insurance;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 c.\u00a0 Personal accident insurance.\nInternational Vehicle Rentals:\nUniversity employees renting vehicles for international business travel outside the coverage territory of the United States, the territories and possessions of the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada are advised to purchase any automobile liability and physical damage insurance required by the specific country.\u00a0 University employees will be reimbursed for any required coverages and\/or the following coverages:\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. Loss Damage Waiver\/Collision Damage Waiver;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. Supplemental liability insurance, if any.\nRegardless of location, the following optional insurance coverages will not be reimbursed:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. Personal effects coverage\/effects protection;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. Personal accident insurance.\nAny accident involving a rental vehicle in either a domestic or international location must be timely reported to both the car rental agency and the Risk Management Office for handling of claims and coordination of coverage.\nGround Transportation\nGround transportation is an appropriate business expense (including a tip) to the extent that such service is necessary for business purposes.\u00a0\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rail Travel\nThe class of rail travel chosen is expected to be the lowest-priced coach rail ticket available.\u00a0 In some cases, premium (e.g., first class) fares may be an appropriate business expense subject to budget availability and approval by the president, the provost, the department's dean, vice-president or the designated departmental finance representative.\u00a0\nTravelers are encouraged to request pre-approval for premium fares and must follow departmental guidelines\/procedures.\u00a0\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Foreign Travel\nAll policies and procedures pertaining to travel apply to foreign travel. Actual costs are reimbursable, to the extent reasonable and necessary, provided valid business purposes and appropriate documentation are submitted with the expense report.\nThe U.S. State Department maintains a list of countries for which travel advisories have been issued.\u00a0 Countries where avoidance of travel is recommended will have Travel Warnings as well as Consular Information sheets.\u00a0 The State Department's Web site for travel advisories is:\u00a0http:\/\/travel.state.gov.\nAdditionally, a traveler should consult the additional university travel resources (Global Security and the Risk Management Office) at least 30 days prior to any planned travel to any sanctioned countries.\nForeign travel funded by sponsored grants or contracts may require agency or sponsor approval prior to travel.\u00a0 Individuals traveling abroad should consult agency guidelines and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures and restrictions are followed.\u00a0 Any questions or interpretation of Federal or sponsor restrictions should be directed to the designated Departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.\u00a0 Most Federal agencies require that all foreign travel be on a U.S. carrier unless circumstances, such as lengthy holdovers, preclude using a United States airline (See Air Transportation). Many sponsoring agencies or sponsors must specifically approve trips abroad well in advance of departure. This requirement exists whether or not travel is referenced in the grant or contract award notification. Arrangements for foreign travel supported by sponsoring agencies or sponsors can be complex, requiring not only prior approval but detailed justification for each trip, as well as detailed trip reports.\nFor travel to and from Qatar, travelers must work through the Office of International Finance.\u00a0\nB. LODGING\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\nThe university will directly pay or reimburse a traveler for lodging expenses for the single occupancy cost of a standard room incurred during university-related travel.\u00a0 Travelers must retain an itemized hotel bill for reimbursement of their lodging expenses if the per diem lodging allowance is not used (See Travel Per Diem Options - For Employees Only).\u00a0 A per diem lodging allowance is not permitted for non-employees.\u00a0\nThe university will not pay for free accommodations awarded in connection with hotel frequent guest programs or any complimentary room accommodations provided by a hotel or other third party.\u00a0\nSome sponsored project contracts set forth per-diem rates for lodging expenses.\u00a0 Individuals traveling should consult agency guidelines and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures related to lodging are followed.\u00a0 Any questions or interpretation of Federal or sponsor restrictions should be directed to the designated departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cancellations\nThe university will pay for expenses incurred from cancelling guaranteed room reservations only with a detailed explanation of the extenuating circumstances.\u00a0 The detailed explanation must be approved by the president, the provost, the department's dean, a vice-president, or the designated departmental finance representative and this approval should be documented and submitted as appropriate.\u00a0 It is the traveler's responsibility to request a refund from the hotel for a \"no show\" charge.\u00a0\nC. TRAVEL PER DIEM OPTIONS - FOR EMPLOYEES ONLY\nEmployees may choose from one of the following travel per diem options:\n\nA per diem for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses (tips, etc.); or\nA per diem for meals and incidental expenses (with lodging being either reimbursed on the basis of actual expenses incurred or directly paid by the University).\n\nDepartments may require reimbursement based on actual expenses with receipts in lieu of per diem based upon departmental-specific policies and procedures (including for budgetary requirements).\u00a0 Employees at international locations may be required to adhere to country specific per diem rates and should consult their local business office with questions.\u00a0\nU.S. General Services Administration (GSA) periodically revises the per diem rates based on the costs of meals and lodging.\u00a0 \u00a0Employees must use the per diem rates in effect at the time of travel.\u00a0 The per diem rates used must comply with those listed on the GSA website at: http:\/\/www.gsa.gov\/perdiem\/\nDepartments may elect to reimburse its employees for amounts below the per diem rates (since in many cases reimbursement on a per diem basis will be more costly than reimbursement of actual expenses).\u00a0 Per diems apply to the entire travel period - an employee cannot be reimbursed on a per diem basis for only a portion of a trip.\u00a0 A per diem reimbursement cannot be provided if there is reason to believe that the employee will not incur expenses for lodging and\/or meals (e.g., if lodging is provided and paid for by the University).\nPer diem calculations for the first and last day of travel must take into account departure and arrival times and must be prorated accordingly if the first and\/or last business day of travel does not encompass at least 7.5 hours of travel and\/or work time in the aggregate.\nAdditionally, the university's meal and incidental expense per diem should be reduced to account for meals furnished at no cost to the employee. For example, if meal costs are provided in the cost of a conference, airfare or hotel, those meals should be deducted from the daily per-diem rate as defined on the GSA website.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nEmployees who are eligible to receive per diem reimbursement need not submit receipts for the lodging and\/or meals covered by a per diem. However, recipients of per diem must submit documentation (e.g., airline and conference itineraries) confirming the dates they have been in a travel status.\nIn addition to per diem, employees may be reimbursed for certain other travel and business expenses.\u00a0 These expenses may include the costs of business transportation (including local transportation), business telephone calls, and other miscellaneous business expenses; all of the latter must be reimbursed on an actual basis, with appropriate receipts. If per diem option 2) above is chosen, the employee may also be reimbursed for lodging expenses based upon actual expenses incurred.\nTRIPS OVER 30 DAYS\nWhen travel is expected to occur for more than 30 consecutive days in one location, or when the circumstances of the travel are such that the traveler can reasonably be expected to incur expenses comparable to those arising from the use of establishments catering to the long term visitor or from the use of non-commercial facilities, the traveler may be reimbursed either for the actual and reasonable costs incurred or with a per-diem allowance equal to 60% of the standard rate for the appropriate geographic area.\u00a0 The reduced rate begins with the first day of travel.\nD. ALCOHOL, MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\nDepending on the particular circumstances under which the expenses are incurred, expenses for alcohol, meals, and entertainment will be either:\n\nentertainment expenses (see Business Entertainment) incurred in the course of conducting business, none of which are allowable as either a direct or indirect expense of Federally-sponsored projects;\nbusiness expenses, some or all of which may be allowable as either a direct or indirect expense of Federally-sponsored projects, and some of which may not be (alcohol is always unallowable); or\npersonal expenses.\n\nFederal regulations require that these expenses be treated appropriately.\u00a0\nFor meals and entertainment funded by a sponsored grant or contract, the individual incurring the business expense should consult agency guidelines and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures and restrictions are followed.\u00a0 Any questions or interpretation of Federal or sponsor restrictions should be directed to the designated departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Travelers' Meals\nThe university will reimburse travelers for the reasonable cost of their own meals incurred during the time they are away from home (as distinguished from business entertainment expenses or local business meals covered in the following sections).\nEmployees can choose to be reimbursed via per diem or actual cost for meals.\u00a0 Non-employees can only be reimbursed for actual costs incurred for meals.\u00a0\nAs a general rule, travelers are expected to incur no additional cost for meals which are provided as part of a fee for attendance at conferences, workshops, hotel cost, etc., or which are provided by an airline while en route to their destination. When meals are provided in this way, the daily meal per diem must be reduced accordingly (see Travel Per Diem Options - For Employees Only). If there is a business justification provided regarding dietary restrictions, the traveler may be reimbursed for the meal.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe traveler is responsible for notifying the business expense preparer regarding meals that were included as part of the conference registration fee, hotel cost, etc.\u00a0 \u00a0\nTravelers sometimes pay for meals for others for university business reasons.\u00a0 These business expenses must include the name(s) of the meal attendees and the business purpose of the meal. If the attendees are not university employees, their affiliation with the university should be provided.\u00a0 For meals with six or more individuals including the traveler, the traveler need only identify the number of other people at the meal.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Business Meals and Meetings When Not Traveling\na. Employee Only Business Meals\nIn cases where university employees meet over a meal when they are not traveling, the cost of the meal is considered a personal expense unless the primary purpose of the meeting is to conduct university business and there is a need to meet over the meal.\u00a0 Generally, these requirements are met when it is not possible for one or more employees to meet during working hours (e.g., when travel plans conflict with other meeting times), and the purpose of the meeting is to conduct university business in accordance with a formal agenda. IRS regulations do not allow for payment of meal expenses incurred by employees who are not traveling away from home (e.g., their travel does not require an overnight stay) unless the above criteria are met. These business expenses are permissible when the name(s) of the meal attendees (all names are required for those meals with five or fewer individuals) have been documented and the business purpose of the meal is justified.\u00a0\nIt is permissible to incur expenses for meals provided as part of a local conference, seminar, workshop, presentation or other similar group meeting involving employees when it extends through the usual mealtime(s). Such meals must be reasonable in nature and the purpose of the meeting must be documented accordingly to ensure that it is an appropriate business expense.\u00a0\nLike all business and travel expenses, all business meals are subject to budget availability.\nb. Occasional Employee Banquets and Functions\nOccasional - generally, annual or semi-annual - functions for employees are considered business expenses when the function is intended to serve as a token of appreciation that primarily promotes employee relations\/morale, or that recognizes individual or group achievements, such as holiday parties, employee banquets, retirement parties, etc. While reasonable expenses for these functions may be considered appropriate business expenses per this Policy, they may be unallowable for Federal reimbursement (either directly or indirectly).\u00a0\nOccasions that are personal in nature such as parties to celebrate births, marriages, etc., or small in-office functions with purchased food or beverages are ordinarily paid for by the employees involved and are not ordinarily considered business expenses.\nc. Recruiting and Other Business Meals\nExpenses for dining involving non-university personnel are considered business expenses when the purpose of the meeting is to conduct university business and when it is necessary or appropriate to have the meeting in conjunction with, or during, a meal. Expenses for such meals should be kept to a reasonable level. The typical business meal might involve interviews of prospective employees, discussions with vendors, consultants, or other individuals with whom the university does business, or meetings of organizations and groups at which agenda items pertinent to university business are covered.\nInclusion of companions\/spouses or other individuals who are not directly involved in conducting university business are general indications that the occasion is not a business meal, but an entertainment function (see Business Entertainment).\nRecruiting expenses are further subject to departmental specific policies and procedures.\nd. Alcohol in Conjunction with Business Meals and Individual Travelers\nWhile not encouraged, alcohol may be considered a business expense (as distinguished from an entertainment expense) when served at university functions primarily intended to promote employee relations, such as faculty receptions, holiday parties, and the like.\u00a0\u00a0\nBecause alcohol cannot be charged to a Federal grant or contract (either directly or indirectly), alcohol costs must be charged to the unallowable object code\/expense type and to a non-Federal account.\nAlcohol and tobacco are not permissible expenses to be charged to the Qatar entity.\nE. BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is Business Entertainment?\nMeals and functions are considered entertainment if they are intended to provide hospitality to non-university individuals which, although partially social in nature, are necessary and customary in furthering the university's business.\nExamples of business entertainment include:\n\nreceptions for University guests and visitors;\nalumni reunions or similar alumni functions;\nentertaining donors or prospective donors; and\nwelcoming receptions for parents and students.\n\nMeals and functions which include companions or spouses or other individuals who are not directly involved in conducting university business are general indications that the meal or function is entertainment rather than a business meal or meeting.\u00a0 (See Companion\/Spousal Travel and Business Expenses)\nEntertainment expenses should be reasonable in relation to the nature of the meal or function and the resulting business benefit expected to be derived from the expenses. A description (either a list of names or identification of the hosted group) and the total number in attendance at an entertainment meal or function must be indicated along with the business purpose of the entertainment. The business purpose of the entertainment must also be documented.\nBecause entertainment expenses are rarely, if ever, allowable as either direct or indirect costs of Federally sponsored grants and contracts, it is imperative that these and any related alcohol costs be segregated and charged to either an unallowable object code\/expense type or appropriate function to ensure that the amount is excluded from any calculation of direct or indirect sponsored project costs.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alcohol in Conjunction with Business Entertainment\nIf it is deemed appropriate by the individual's designated departmental finance representative or department's dean to include alcohol at university entertainment functions, expenses for the alcohol must be charged to the unallowable object code\/expense type.\u00a0\nAlcohol and tobacco are not permissible expenses to be charged to the Qatar entity.\u00a0\nF. OTHER BUSINESS AND TRAVEL EXPENSES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Visitors, Recruits, Independent Contractors, Consultants, Students, Courtesy Appointments and Other Non-Employees\nGeneral\nWhen the university has agreed to cover the cost of travel, room and\/or board, and other expenses of visitors, recruits, independent contractors, consultants, students, courtesy appointments, and\/or other non-employees (hereinafter referred to as non-employees), unless the relevant contract with the non-employee requires otherwise, this Policy applies to their expenses as well. Non-employees must adhere to the same reasonableness standards and submit required receipts or other documentation supporting expenses. It is the responsibility of the department to make non-employees aware of this Policy. \u00a0Payment of non-employee's expenses will be made once the following have occurred:\n\nA non-employee expense report has been submitted that documents the relationship of the individual, clearly describes the business purpose of the expenses, includes proper supporting documentation, and is approved by the applicable department.\n\n\nThe Travel and Expense Reporting department in the Controller's Office has audited the expense report for valid business purpose, accuracy and proper supporting documentation.\u00a0 (Note that as a result of the audit, additional information may be requested.)\n\nDepartments may also consider entering into an appropriate contract with the non-employee for payment of fees that includes the non-employees expenses rather than submitting a non-employee expense report for payment of expenses.\nThe university will reimburse or pay for the travel costs of students and non-employees (such as job applicants, graduate student pre-admission visits, seminar speakers, lecturers, consultants and other individuals) when it has agreed to do so, such as when one of the following circumstances exists:\n\nrequired by contract;\npart of an established educational program in which the costs are included in the educational program fee charged;\nparticipating in research or group educational activities at the University's request;\nparticipating in approved student events or activities;\nrecruiting for the University; or\napproved by a department head, dean or designated departmental finance representative.\n\nIn cases where the payment may be considered a reimbursement of the student's personal expenses rather than a university business expenses, the reimbursement may be taxable to the student as a non-qualified scholarship.\u00a0\u00a0 Questions regarding whether a payment may be considered a non-qualified scholarship should be directed to the Taxation Department.\u00a0\nFor non-employee expenses funded by a sponsored grant or contract, the individual incurring the business expense should consult agency guidelines and\/or the relevant contract to ensure that all agency or sponsor procedures and restrictions are followed.\u00a0 Any questions or interpretation of Federal or sponsor restrictions should be directed to the designated departmental finance representative who may need to consult with the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Professional Development\nReasonable expenses incurred in attending professional development programs are considered business expenses. Department supervisors determine who may attend such programs at university expense, subject to budget availability.\u00a0 Supervisors should ensure that the content of the program is of a substantive nature that directly relates to the employee's job responsibilities at the university. Supervisors should consult with designated departmental finance representative for budget availability.\u00a0\nProfessional organizations can often provide expertise and training that is not available on campus.\u00a0 Program content should be carefully considered in weighing the cost of travel as compared to the benefit to the university.\u00a0\nTravel expenses and fees associated with continuing education credits required to maintain a professional certification that is not directly related to the employee's job responsibilities at the university are not reimbursable business expenses.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Memberships, Dues, and Subscriptions\nThe university's affiliation with an organization or group is based upon the business benefit to be derived by the University from such affiliation. In the case of certain civic, community, and educational organizations that serve a broader purpose and constituency, the university typically joins as an institutional member and, as such, designates employee representatives. Institutional memberships often provide certain benefits (such as reports, studies, etc.) to the university at large and may also provide news updates and magazines that are routinely sent to a specified number of individual employees on the membership mailing list. Employees who attend meetings or functions as representatives of the university are eligible for reimbursement of travel expenses if approved by their respective departments.\u00a0\nFees for individual memberships in business associations as well as fees for magazine, newspaper, or newsletter subscriptions may be reimbursable if appropriate. Departmental supervisors establish whether these costs will be covered by the university. Individual membership in professional associations or other costs incurred to maintain professional certifications or licenses that are directly related to the employee's job responsibilities at the university and have a clear business benefit to the university may be considered appropriate business expenses.\nThe cost of memberships in athletic clubs, faculty clubs, social clubs, shopping clubs, business membership, fraternal orders, or other similar organizations generally do not qualify as business expenses. Employees must pay for these memberships personally, unless there is a clear business benefit to the University and the primary purpose of the membership is to benefit the university. In these instances, the cost must be approved by the president, the provost, the department's dean, a vice-president, or the designated departmental finance representative.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Miscellaneous Business Expenses\nOther expenses including but not limited to postage, supplies, photocopying charges, etc. purchased for business use are considered business expenses. The payment for these types of miscellaneous business expenses must also include proper documentation and business justification.\u00a0\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Miscellaneous Travel Costs\nOther travel expenses may include, but are not limited to:\n\nbusiness telephone calls using personal devices while traveling;\nhotel internet service fees;\nfees for passports and visas, if specifically obtained in order to perform work for or on behalf of the university;\nfees for currency exchanges;\nnecessary laundry and dry cleaning charges after completing \u00a0five consecutive days of business travel;\nexpenses associated with baggage handling and storage, including excess baggage charges and tips; and\nphone calls home in a reasonable amount.\n\nAll such expenses must be itemized and documented in accordance with this Policy.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Personal and Companion\/Spousal Business And Travel Expenses\na. General\nThe university will not direct pay or reimburse travelers for expenses that are inherently personal in nature.\u00a0\u00a0 Please refer to the General Overview section of this Policy for examples of items that are personal in nature.\u00a0\nb. Personal Business Conducted During Period of Travel\nPersonal expenses, as well as any incremental travel costs incurred for personal business during the course of a university business trip, are the responsibility of the traveler. \u00a0Incremental travel costs include expenses that would not have been incurred on the business portion of the trip, except for the fact that the traveler conducted personal business at some point during the trip.\nFor example, gas and mileage charges for out-of-the-way travel to visit friends or relatives are personal expenses. \u00a0Such expenses must be identified and deducted from the expenses reported on the expense report.\u00a0 Expenses for personal gain (e.g., personal consulting) cannot be reimbursed.\u00a0\nPersonal expenses may not be charged to university accounts (even if the intention of the traveler or a third party is to later reimburse the university for these expenses).\u00a0 Airline reservations for personal travel made using a university preferred travel agency should be charged to a personal credit card and not billed to a university account.\nUsing the university as a conduit for personal expenses may result in disciplinary action.\nc. Companion\/Spousal Business and Travel Expenses\nExpenses incurred for accompanying companions\/spouses are considered personal in nature except on occasions when attendance of a companion\/spouse at an event serves a bona fide business purpose for the university and the presence of the companion\/spouse is essential (not just beneficial) to the employee being able to carry out the business purpose for the university.\u00a0\nIn these cases, the business and\/or travel expense should be authorized in writing by the president, the provost, the department's dean, a vice-president, or the designated departmental finance representative. The written approval must be submitted with the expense report and must detail the business purpose served by the companion\/spouse's attendance at the event and how the companion\/spouse's presence was essential in carrying out that business purpose. Since these costs are always unallowable as direct or indirect costs for Federal reimbursement, these costs must be recorded using an appropriate unallowable object code or function.\u00a0 Likewise, if companion\/spousal travel is coordinated with a preferred travel agency and to be paid for by the university, written approval must be obtained by one of the persons outlined above, and must be submitted with the travel request.\u00a0\nAmounts paid by the university for companion\/spousal travel and\/or business expenses must be included in the employee's W-2 as taxable wages unless the companion\/spouse's attendance at the event meets the above requirements. Departments should consult the Taxation Department prior to making commitments to reimburse for companion\/spousal travel and\/or business expenses as the reimbursement may be taxable to the employee.\nG. RELOCATION OF NEW EMPLOYEES\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Requirements\nUniversity departments may, in hiring new employees, agree to pay a portion of the cost of relocating the new employees and their families.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What Will Be Reported On The New Employee's W-2 For Tax Purposes?\nCertain types of moving expenses paid or reimbursed by the university must be treated as additional compensation to the employee, subject to both income and employment tax withholding. Generally, if the expenses paid by the university qualify as deductible moving expenses by the employee and are supported by original receipts or other appropriate documentation, the payments are not required to be reported on the employee's W-2 for United States Federal income tax purposes.\u00a0 \u00a0\nA department may elect to cover all or a portion of taxable expenses of relocating a new employee; but the new employee should be informed in advance of the move that the payment of these expenses may be subject to payroll and tax reporting withholding.\nInternational relocation expenses are handled per the university allowance guidelines.\u00a0 Please contact International Human Resources for additional information.\u00a0\n\nIII.

Required Documentation and Receipts\n\nA.\u00a0 TRAVEL ADVANCES \n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\nThe university will provide travel advances in appropriate amounts for employees traveling on authorized university business to cover reasonable miscellaneous costs, such as taxi fares, tips, and other business expenses.\u00a0 Travel advances must not be used to cover personal expenses.\u00a0 The size of the advance must be a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash necessary to conduct university business.\nEach travel advance is the personal obligation of the traveler. Thus, the traveler is responsible for any lost or stolen travel advances (whenever possible, travelers should use hotel vaults to safe keep cash or other valuables). Employees are responsible for submitting an expense report with required receipts to account for the travel advance and for returning the unused balance of the travel advance.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Procedures for Obtaining Travel Advances\nTravel advances are not a benefit.\u00a0 Rather, they are a mechanism to support the business needs of university employees when traveling and appropriate.\u00a0 Requests for travel advances are submitted on the Travel Expense Advance Request form.\u00a0 Designated departmental finance representatives may implement additional processes or limit travel advances.\u00a0\nAdvances will not be granted to employees who have an uncleared prior travel advance unless the president, the provost, the department's dean, a vice-president, or the designated departmental finance representative certifies that extenuating circumstances warrant the second advance.\nThe Controller's Office may revoke the right to obtain travel advances when necessary to avoid perceived abuse.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Availability of Travel Advances\nTravel advances will generally not be provided earlier than three working days before the planned departure date of the trip unless there are extenuating circumstances or an approved exception.\nEmployees must immediately return any travel advance to Travel and Expense Reporting department when a trip has been canceled or has been postponed for more than five working days.\nIf travel advances are greater than the expenses incurred, the traveler must return the remaining balance (by personal check) to Travel and Expense Reporting department in the Controller's office at the same time the expense report is submitted.\u00a0\u00a0\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uncleared Travel Advances (including Payroll Reporting)\nThe Travel and Expense Reporting department in the Controller's Office monitors uncleared travel advances and sends email notifications to travelers if the advance is not cleared within 30 days of travel completion.\u00a0 If an individual fails to substantiate the business expenses covered by the travel advance within 90 days after completing the travel (e.g., clearing the advance), the university is required by the IRS to report these payments as taxable income to the employee.\nAn employee may not obtain additional travel advances if the employee has uncleared outstanding travel advances except in the case of extenuating circumstances as described above.\u00a0\nB.\u00a0 EXPENSE DOCUMENTATION\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General\nThe primary responsibility for expense documentation rests with the individual requesting reimbursement or incurring the business or travel expenses and the departments and supervisors who are authorizing and approving these business and travel expenses.\nBecause university business and travel expenses are subject to audit by government agencies, internal and external auditors and other sponsors, thorough documentation and accounting for expenses is required.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Required Documentation and Receipts\nAll individuals requesting reimbursement or incurring business and travel expenses are required to scan and attach\u00a0 original receipts to substantiate their business\u00a0 expenses (except in the case of per diem reimbursements - see Travel Per Diem Options - For Employees Only). As with any University payment, original documentation is necessary to verify expenditures and eliminate the possibility of duplicate payments. All single expenditures of $75 and greater need to be accompanied by original receipts.\u00a0 If, in rare cases, original receipts are not available, a Missing Receipt Form must be completed.\u00a0\nIt is not appropriate to round-off amounts or to estimate expenses. In cases where receipts are not required to be submitted, e.g., highway tolls, tips, or an expense in an amount less than $75, etc., individuals must still report the actual amounts of the charges and itemize these expenses.\u00a0\nDetailed receipts that support credit card charges are considered to be original receipts and must be submitted.\u00a0 Photocopies of credit card charge slips or credit card statements are not sufficient documentation.\u00a0 Tear-off stubs for meals should be accompanied by a cash register receipt. If no other form of receipt can be obtained, the original credit card statement will be accepted. In the case of airfare not charged directly to a departmental account through a university preferred travel agency, travelers must provide proof of payment. Travel itineraries do not constitute receipts for reimbursement purposes.\nMeal and restaurant receipts should include the name and location of the restaurant, the number of people served and the date and amount of the expense. If alcohol is included in the receipt total, it must\u00a0be identified and recorded separately from the rest of the meal.\u00a0 This must be done since alcohol is not an allowable direct or indirect expense on federally sponsored projects.\u00a0\nDepartments must maintain original documentation (including receipts) in accordance with the University's Policy for Financial Records Retention. Original documentation is required to comply with Federal regulations.\u00a0\nItemizing Expenses\nExpenses should be allocated to the proper Oracle account number(s) based upon object code\/expense type. In addition to segregating unallowable items and omitting non-business expenses, charges on itemized hotel or other bills such as meals, telephone, parking, internet fees, etc. should be broken out and reported separately. Authorized persons approving business or travel expenses are primarily responsible for enforcing this Policy and, in so doing, must be satisfied that the expenses are appropriate, reasonable, and sufficiently described and documented in a manner consistent with this Policy.\nApproval Authority\nEach department has a defined expense approval hierarchy in the Oracle Financial System.\u00a0 This requires that the approver of a business expense must be the individual's supervisor or someone at a higher level than the supervisor.\u00a0\nNo individual is authorized to approve his or her own, a peer's or a supervisor's business or travel expenses.\u00a0 In assigning approvers for expense transactions, bear in mind that an individual must have signing limits\/access to the organizations where expense transactions will be charged.\u00a0\nThis restriction is imperative due to the nature of business and travel expenses and the authority that must be exercised by supervisors in approving or disallowing expenses in accordance with the Policy.\nProof of Payment\nWhen requesting reimbursement for travel or business expenses paid via personal check, a copy of the front and back of the check or scanned image may be required to substantiate the expense.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

General questions about Policy content should be directed to the University Registrar's Office, 412-268-7404.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe HUB\nStudent Handbook\/The Word\nStudent Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures\nStudent Health Services\n\n\n\n\n \nPolicy Statement\nUniversity Suspension is a forced, temporary leave from the university. There are three types of suspension for students that apply to both graduate and undergraduate students:\nAcademic Suspension is the result of poor academic performance or violation of academic regulations and is imposed by the student's college or academic department (see university and college academic policies).\nDisciplinary Suspension is the result of serious personal misconduct and is imposed by the Office of Student Affairs (see The Word\/Student Handbook).\nAdministrative Suspension is the result of failure to meet university financial obligations or failure to comply with federal, state or local health regulations and is imposed by Enrollment Services. (See Student Accounts Receivable Collection Policy and Procedures for financial obligations. Contact Student Health Services for information about health regulations.)\nSuspended students may not:\n\nregister for courses\nattend classes\nlive in student or fraternity\/sorority housing\nuse campus facilities, including athletic facilities, library and computer clusters\nparticipate in student activities\nbe members of student organizations\nhave student jobs (Note: students on academic suspension may have a summer campus job if they accepted the job before they were suspended.)\n\nEmployment\nAlthough suspended students may not hold student jobs, students on academic suspension may, under certain circumstances, have a non-student job with the university; students on disciplinary or administrative suspension may not.\nTo have a non-student job, students on academic suspension must receive approval from their associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students) to ensure that the job will not violate their suspension terms. Students in violation of this will lose their degree student status, meaning they would have to reapply for admission to Carnegie Mellon through either Undergraduate Admission or the appropriate graduate department.\nTransfer Credit\nSuspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.\nAppeals\nTo appeal any action of this policy, the student may write to the following people:\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students);\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs;\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for enrollment, vice president for business and planning, and the dean of student affairs, in consultation with the student's associate dean.\nReturning from Suspension\nIn order to return from a suspension, a student must have the following approval:\nAcademic Suspension - associate dean (undergraduate students) or department head (graduate students);\nDisciplinary Suspension - dean of student affairs;\nAdministrative Suspension - vice president for campus affairs or his designate.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the associate vice provost for Research Compliance, ext. 8-4727.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFORMS AND RELATED INFORMATION:\nSee the Office of Research Integrity and Compliance website.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThe university is committed to the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects in research investigations conducted under the jurisdiction of the university. The university believes that review independent of the investigator is necessary to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects of research investigations. All research involving human subjects is conducted in accordance with federal regulations, including Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 (45 CFR 46). Under federal regulations, human subjects are defined as: living individual(s) about whom an investigator conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) identifiable private information.\nAn Institutional Review Board (IRB) is established under the provost to ensure adequate safeguards. The provost is responsible for the composition of the IRB with respect to: (1) the qualifications of IRB members in terms of educational background and research or other relevant experience, and (2) broad representation of relevant university interests.\nThis IRB is responsible for reviewing investigational procedures involving human subjects prior to the initiation of the research procedure in reference to (1) the rights and welfare of the individuals involved, (2) the appropriateness of the methods used to obtain informed consent, and (3) the risks and potential benefits of the investigations. The IRB is responsible for determining when additional expertise is required for adequate review and for obtaining that additional expertise. The IRB is further responsible for maintaining records of its review activities and decisions and for ensuring that records of informed consent are developed and kept by investigators where appropriate.\nIt is the responsibility of investigators who plan to use human subjects in research to obtain written consent from the IRB prior to conducting an investigation involving human subjects. It is the investigator's further responsibility to take whatever steps are determined necessary for the protection of the subjects, and to meet the reporting requirements established by the IRB.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions regarding this policy or its intent should be directed to the Office of Sponsored Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThis announcement is a university policy statement to establish the option for faculty members to earn 1\/9 of their academic salary during the month of June from work on sponsored research contracts or grants.\nFaculty members on an academic contract who have summer research support may request a third one-ninth salary payment for June. Each college will establish a set of guidelines that define eligibility. Requests will be reviewed by the department head and dean. They will be approved subject to the college guidelines on summer research support and university policy. Under no circumstances, however, will college E & GO allocations be increased to allow faculty to reduce academic salary support in favor of additional summer salary.\nFor an individual to be charged to a research account, that person must be working on the contract to which the salary will be charged during the month in which the salary will be charged. Individuals may not transfer effort from one month to another. Faculty who work full time during the entire summer will earn a total of one week of vacation time for the three months of effort. This week of paid vacation time may be taken during the summer months - June, July, or August - and charged to a sponsored research contract. Faculty who wish to take a summer vacation in excess of the normal one week accrual should not charge the additional vacation time to a sponsored research grant.\nIn addition to approval of the department head and dean, a faculty member must have the approval of the sponsoring agency before he or she may receive a third one-ninth payment. Some sponsoring agencies will not allow charges for a third one-ninth to their contracts. Other agencies limit increases in salary charges over the approved budget and require specific authorization. The Office of Sponsored Research can assist in clarifying whether or not a third one-ninth can be charged to a contract.\n\u00a0  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It also applies to volunteers and contractors working on behalf of the university.\n\n\nDefinitions\nConfidential information: All alumni, student, parent, friend, organization, donor, and prospect information in any format (database record, e-mail, any other electronic format, hard copy, voicemail, or conversation) and information about employees, including compensation, date of birth, and other personal information that is not considered publishable.\n\n\nForms \/ Instructions\nn\/a\n\n\nRelated Information\nInformation Security Policy Computing Policy\n\n\nReason for Policy \/ Purpose\n\nUniversity Advancement is committed to safeguarding the confidential information of Carnegie Mellon alumni, students, parents, friends, donors, prospects, employees, and other members of the university community. The purpose of this policy is to outline who can access Advancement-owned data, the steps required to receive that access, and the acceptable use of that data.\nThis Policy complements broader university policies related to information security and computing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nInformation Confidentiality and Usage\nAll confidential information must be used for university business purposes only, as approved by University Advancement leadership.\nThe actions of collecting, accessing, using, destroying, or disclosing confidential information may only occur within the scope of employee responsibilities. Supervisors must approve all use of confidential information that falls outside normal employee responsibilities. If employees discover that they have access to information outside the scope of their normal responsibilities, they must notify their supervisors immediately.\nUnless specifically authorized to do so by the Vice President for University Advancement, information from University Advancement data sources must not be used in separate persistent databases, \"shadow databases,\" and\/or reporting platforms, as they undermine the primacy and integrity of Advancement\u2019s central information resources. Information generated from Advancement\u2019s database of record should be used quickly or refreshed periodically to ensure validity.\nEmployees must exercise reasonable effort to secure and protect from disclosure any confidential information downloaded to or stored on any type of electronic device (e.g., computer, mobile device, etc.) or peripheral (e.g., memory card, external hard drive, etc.). Information on physically securing electronic devices is available from Advancement Information Systems (AIS) at adv-help@andrew.cmu.edu and from the Information Security Office at iso@andrew.cmu.edu. Data downloaded from Advancement\u2019s database of record and other systems, including the fileserver, must be deleted when no longer needed.\nEmployees must exercise reasonable effort to secure and protect from disclosure any confidential information in hard copy. Materials containing confidential information should not be removed from the Advancement offices of the university, except when within the scope of the responsibilities of employment. All hard copy confidential information marked for disposal must be shredded.\nPasswords act as a signature to access confidential information. Employees are required to read and follow the policy on \"Selecting a More Effective Password.\" If employees have reason to believe that the confidentiality of passwords has been violated, they are required to notify their supervisors immediately and ensure that the passwords are promptly changed. Employees will not share login ID and\/or password information with anyone.\nUpon termination of university employment, the rights and access associated with a user ID and password will also be terminated. Employees must immediately return all documents and\/or materials containing confidential information to Carnegie Mellon, including methods of providing access to such information (e.g., training documentation). It is further expected that, following cessation of employment at Carnegie Mellon, the individual will continue to treat confidential information as confidential and that they will refrain from disclosing it or using it for any purpose.\n\nAccess to University Advancement Data by Employees\nIndividuals employed by Carnegie Mellon who have a demonstrable university-related business requirement to access Advancement data will be granted access restricted to that requirement. Such access will only be granted after a formal request is submitted and the employee signs and returns the Advancement Data Confidentiality and Usage Form.\nQuestionable or unusual requests by employees for access to Advancement data will be reviewed by the Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with the Associate Vice President for Advancement Programs and Services.\n\nAccess to University Advancement Data by Non-Employees\nSubject to the approval of the Vice President for University Advancement, non-employees working on behalf of the university (e.g., volunteers and contractors) will be permitted to access Advancement data restricted to the requirements of their roles.\nThese individuals must sign any agreement(s) required by the university (i.e., related to confidentiality, usage, etc.) prior to receiving such access, and will be subsequently bound by the requirements set forth in this policy.\nDonors to the university may request and receive a list of the charitable gifts they have made to the university. Otherwise, Advancement data will be unavailable to non-employees and non-volunteers, unless approved by the Vice President for University Advancement.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on Policy content should be directed to University Health Services, ext. 8-2157.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\u00a0\nReferences and resources can be found on the\u00a0University Health Services\u00a0website.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Rationale\nThe university values personal and community health and recognizes the critical role that each individual plays in contributing to community health by participating in personal health care practices that prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Participation in a vaccination program represents one such highly effective personal health practice.  Vaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant threat to the public health of the campus community, impose a significant cost to infected individuals in terms of mortality and morbidity and impose a cost to other community members by disrupting university life and academic activities.\u00a0 Therefore, the university expects that all individuals will value the importance of protecting themselves and others by obtaining vaccinations against vaccine-preventable diseases and acknowledges the institution\u2019s role in supporting public health by monitoring the vaccination status of incoming students through its policy on immunization requirements.\nPolicy Statement\nThe goal of the university is to provide adequate protection of the campus community against vaccine-preventable diseases. This goal can best be achieved through a prematriculation immunization requirement that is administered by University Health Services (UHS).\u00a0 All students are required to comply with the immunization requirements and the screening protocol for tuberculosis.\u00a0\nImplementation Guidelines\nImmunization Requirements for Students\n\nRequired vaccinations shall be determined by UHS (http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/health-services\/immunization\/index.html) and shall be consistent with Pennsylvania State Law and informed by the recommendations of the American College Health Association and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\n\nVaccination requirements will be reviewed annually by UHS.\u00a0 Any changes in the requirements effective\u00a0 in the upcoming school year will be communicated to incoming students and the university community in the spring term prior to implementation that fall.\n\n\nApplication or modification of this policy for non-Pittsburgh locations will be determined by the Director of University Health Services, in consultation with relevant colleagues in those locations.\n\nAdditional Requirements for Students Residing in University Housing\n\nBecause vaccine preventable diseases spread more readily in a residential environment, UHS may set additional requirements for students who elect to live in university housing.\u00a0\n\nRequest for Waiver\n\nA student may request a waiver from any vaccination for medical reasons or if vaccination conflicts with personal or religious beliefs by contacting UHS.\u00a0 If an outbreak of contagious disease occurs, the university reserves the right to ask students who have not been vaccinated against that disease to leave campus until the outbreak is over.\n\nScreening Protocol for Tuberculosis\n\nStudents with an increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis are expected to comply with screening requirements as set forth by UHS and informed by recommendations of the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control.\u00a0\n\nPenalty for Noncompliance\n\nIf a student fails to comply with the immunization policy, UHS will notify the University Registrar who will change the student\u2019s enrollment status to reflect that the student is not enrolled until the requirements are met.\n\n\nAdditionally, if the student is a resident in university housing and fails to comply with the immunization requirements, he\/she will be removed from housing. A fee may be assessed by Housing for reactivation of the room key if the student later complies with the policy.\n\nRelated Policies and Procedures\nThe university complies with OSHA regulations regarding occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens. Questions regarding these regulations should be directed to Environmental Health and Safety, 412-268-8182.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education tuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance with the university's commitment to non-discrimination.\nFurther, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for employment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements are used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and complies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related disability.\nReason for the Policy\nThis EEO\/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an update on current responsibilities.\nThe university recognizes that its success depends on the development and use of the full range of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and enhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university intends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon stronger in sustaining world-class distinction.\nRegulatory Compliance\nThe university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state and local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and applicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, discrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under the above statutes and executive order.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the applicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy.\nAccountability\nThis policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by the president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice president for human resources and director for equal opportunity services.\nEqual employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO\/AA as a critical component of university operations.\nResponsibility\nThe broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and affirmative action are everyone's responsibility.\nIn support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity commitments, Everett L. Tademy, assistant vice president for diversity and equal opportunity services, has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO\/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA).\nOther individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO\/AA include:\n\n\n\nFarnam Jahanian, president, ext. 8-2200\nInvolved in all queries concerning the application of our non-discrimination policy as it applies to educational programming, and works with the university's Faculty Review Committee to resolve complaints regarding the application of Carnegie Mellon's policies as they apply to faculty.\n\n\nEverett Tademy, university ombudsman, and assistant vice president for Equal Opportunity Services, ext. 8-1018\nThe ombudsman coordinates formal grievance procedures, hears complaints, clarifies issues and suggests possible solutions to work-related problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It was originally adopted by the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees on December 13, 1993. This information is current for the academic year.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT:\nOffice of the Vice President for Operations. Questions about Policy content should be directed to the Benefits Office, 412-268-2047. For information about other forms of financial aid for children attending Carnegie Mellon, contact The HUB 412-268-8186.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION:\n\nUndergraduate Tuition Benefits for Children of Staff\nThe HUB\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nThe Undergraduate Tuition Benefit Program provides tuition benefits to an eligible faculty member's dependent children enrolled in undergraduate courses at Carnegie Mellon or other accredited colleges and universities.\nEligibility\nIn order to be eligible for undergraduate tuition benefits, faculty members must satisfy the following eligibility requirement:\n\nMust be full-time, in the tenure track, and hold the academic rank of Assistant Professor or higher or full-time Assistant Research Professor, Associate Research Professor, Research Professor (as defined by the Policy on Research Faculty Appointments), or in the full-time Teaching Track (Assistant Teaching Professor, Associate Teaching Professor, Teaching Professor) or Librarian\/Archivist, Senior Librarian\/Archivist, Principle Librarian\/Archivist, Assistant University Librarian, Associate University Librarian, University Librarian.\nThose who report directly to the president, are an officer of the University or have the title of Vice President, Associate Vice President, Assistant Vice President, Vice Provost, Associate Vice Provost, Assistant Vice Provost, or Director of the Office of the Provost, are also covered by the faculty policy on Undergraduate Tuition Benefits for Dependent Children.\n\nIn order to be eligible for undergraduate tuition benefits, children of faculty members must satisfy the following eligibility requirements:\n\nMust meet IRS dependency exemption criteria; and\nMust be born to or legally adopted by the eligible faculty member; and\nMust be enrolled in an undergraduate degree program before the age of 30.\n\nParticipation\nFaculty members may participate provided they meet the eligibility requirements set forth above by the following dates:\n\nOctober 1 to be eligible for the Fall term\nFebruary 1 to be eligible for the Winter\/Spring term\nJune 1 to be eligible for the Summer term\n\nEligibility may be continued under the following circumstances:\n\nFor a faculty member whose employment\u00a0terminates, benefits continue to the end of the current term.\nFor a faculty member who has a\u00a0change in employment status\u00a0(i.e., full-time to part-time status) which would make them ineligible for this benefit during a term, the benefit will cease at the end of the current term in which the employment status change occurs.\nFor a faculty member on an approved university\u00a0leave of absence, eligibility continues (subject to the applicable leave policy) as summarized below:\nDisability Leave of Absence\u00a0- Benefits paid while on Disability Leave.\nFamily and Medical Leave\u00a0- Benefits paid while on Family and Medical Leave if working full-time when the Family and Medical Leave began.\nFaculty Parental Leave - Benefits paid while on Faculty Parental Leave.\nFaculty Professional Leaves\u00a0and\u00a0Faculty Public Service Leaves\u00a0- Benefits paid if receiving Carnegie Mellon benefits.\nPersonal Leave of Absence\u00a0- Benefits paid through current term only.\nFaculty Family Leave\u00a0- Benefits paid through current term only.\n\nFor an eligible faculty member who retires at age 62 or later with at least 15 years of service\u00a0or\u00a0for an eligible faculty member who retires at age 65 or later with at least ten years of service, dependent children remain eligible during retirement.\nFor an eligible faculty member who dies after ten or more years of service, dependent children remain eligible.\n\nBenefit Amount\nTuition Benefits at Carnegie Mellon\nA one hundred percent (100%) tuition benefit is provided for dependent children enrolled in courses at Carnegie Mellon for a maximum of eight (8) terms.\nA fifty percent (50%) tuition benefit is provided for dependent children who enroll in Advanced Placement\/Early Admission (APEA) summer courses. APEA courses\u00a0do not\u00a0count as a term toward the eight-term maximum. Pre-college courses are not covered.\nThere are no limits on the number of children eligible for tuition benefits at Carnegie Mellon.\nTuition Benefits at Other Institutions\nThe benefit level for full-time undergraduate study at other accredited colleges and universities will be awarded for a maximum of eight (8) terms for tuition only, up to the following amounts:\n\nFor eligible faculty members employed and eligible before 1971, tuition benefits will be awarded for up to a maximum of one hundred percent (100%) of the current undergraduate tuition at Carnegie Mellon for a full-time undergraduate course of study. There is no limit on the number of children eligible for this benefit.\nFor eligible faculty members employed and eligible after 1970, tuition benefits will be awarded for up to a maximum of sixty percent (60%) of the current undergraduate tuition at Carnegie Mellon for a full-time undergraduate course of study. Benefits are limited to two (2) children, even if one child did not exhaust his\/her eight (8) term benefit maximum.\n\nNote:\u00a0\u00a0Any tuition benefits received at Carnegie Mellon offset the benefits for which a dependent child is eligible at another institution and vice versa. For example, a child who received tuition benefits at Carnegie Mellon for three terms would be eligible for tuition benefits at another institution for only five terms, since there is an eight-term limit per child under both plans.\nBenefit Coverage\nTuition benefits cover:\n\nCredit-bearing courses only.\nTuition only and are based on the actual tuition charged to the student.\n\nTuition benefits\u00a0do not\u00a0cover:\n\nRoom and board, mandatory fees, lab fees, transportation costs or similar fees for credit-bearing courses.\n\nConditions and Limitations\nThe award of tuition benefits to an eligible faculty member whose child attends Carnegie Mellon is contingent upon acceptance, enrollment and attendance of the dependent child in a course(s)\/degree program at Carnegie Mellon. An application for tuition benefits is not an application for admission to any course or program nor does it constitute approval for any student to continue in any course or program. Each of these requirements is separate from and is additional to an application for tuition benefits.\nThe award of tuition benefits to an eligible faculty member whose child attends another institution is contingent upon acceptance, enrollment and attendance of the dependent child in a\u00a0full-time undergraduate degree program\u00a0at the accredited institution.\nTuition benefits are available for eight (8) terms, whether provided for courses at Carnegie Mellon or at another institution. They need not be consecutive terms.\nSummer study\u00a0(whether full-time or part-time) at Carnegie Mellon or another institution will count as a term.\nPart-time study\u00a0during the academic year (permitted at Carnegie Mellon only) will also count as a term. If a student is attending Carnegie Mellon on a part-time basis, the faculty member may elect to pay for the part-time study themselves rather than use tuition benefits, since the part-time study counts as a term and would be applied toward the 8-term limit.\nFull-time undergraduate students attending\u00a0Carnegie Mellon\u00a0are encouraged to apply for federal grant assistance through the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) by May 1 annually. If you are interested in being considered for any form of financial aid, please contact the HUB at ext. 8-8186 for additional information.\nAll financial aid resources regardless of source(s), including undergraduate tuition benefits, cannot exceed the cost of attendance for the academic year. If tuition benefits result in a student receiving more assistance than the total budgeted cost of education, tuition benefits will be reduced by the amount of the excess.\nState and Local Income Tax Implications\nThe tuition\u00a0benefit paid to other institutions outside of Carnegie Mellon are\u00a0subject to Pennsylvania State and local taxation. Taxes will be withheld from salary, not from the benefit, in the same quarter in which the benefit is paid.\nHow to Apply for Tuition Benefits\nFaculty members whose eligible dependent children are enrolling in courses at Carnegie Mellon or other accredited colleges and universities should submit an application through WorkDay. To ensure timely processing, it is recommended that applications are submitted according to the following schedule:\n\nJuly 1 - for the Fall Term\nDecember 1 - for the Winter\/Spring Term\nApril 1 - for the Summer Term\n\nFaculty members will be notified of eligibility as soon as a determination is made. Students attending Carnegie Mellon will have tuition benefits awarded through The HUB. Students attending other institutions will have tuition benefits remitted directly to the institution. Since some institutions require payment of tuition and fees at the time of registration, parents should be prepared to pre-pay tuition and fees. If this occurs, parents should make arrangements to obtain reimbursement from the institution that the student attends.\nQuestions, or requests for a paper application, should be addressed to CMUWorks Service Center, 4516 Henry Street; or by calling 412-268-4600.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It also appears in the current issue of the Faculty Handbook.\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nOffice of the Provost. Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext.8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\nPertains to consulting by tenure-track and research faculty. Defines procedures to avoid ethical and legal conflicts of interest and to ensure that consulting does not conflict with the proper discharge of university responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\nPolicy on Special Service Payments for Internal Consulting Activities Policy on Research Faculty Appointments Policy on Conflict of Interest\/Commitment Intellectual Property\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThis policy pertains to consulting by tenure-track and research faculty (as defined in the Policy on Research Faculty Appointments, available in the Faculty Handbook) at Carnegie Mellon.\nThe university believes that its educational program, and effective teaching in all its aspects, can flourish only when sustained by continuous, active participation of its faculty in research, enriched in many cases by interaction with industry, artistic organizations, business, government, and other activities and institutions of our society.\nThis interaction is of greatest value when it contributes significantly to the public welfare, offers an opportunity for professional challenge and growth, or otherwise enhances the effectiveness of a faculty member's service to the university.\nInteraction can come in many forms, one of which is consulting. Consulting includes those professional activities related to the faculty member's discipline for which remuneration (beyond a nominal honorarium or reimbursement for expenses) is received.\nThe potential magnitude of outside professional activity, particularly when it entails consulting, is such that orderly procedures must be followed to avoid ethical and legal conflicts of interest and to ensure that such activity does not conflict with the proper discharge of university responsibilities. Essential to the effectiveness of such procedures is complete disclosure of outside professional activities.\nDisclosure\nLiaison between the head of a department and faculty members is the principal means of communication and disclosure in matters involving outside professional activities. It is the obligation of faculty members to keep their department heads continually informed in adequate detail as to all outside professional activities, service on external committees, and other special assignments.\nStandards and Criteria\nPersonal responsibility, integrity, and high ethical standards are the principal factors in avoiding conflicts of interest. The university expects that all members of faculty will conduct their outside activities in a manner which reflects credit on themselves, their profession, and the university without need for specific criteria or rules of conduct. The principal safeguards against abuse include the standards required by professional colleagues and the rigorous process by which the university evaluates and selects individuals for appointment and promotion.\nFull-time Service\nThe obligation inherent in full-time service is difficult to define, since in academic life it means far more than a stated number of hours per week. In a context in which the faculty member has substantial freedom in arranging his or her professional life, it implies an overriding interest, loyalty, and first responsibility to the university. This obligation, therefore, must be defined qualitatively, depending on principle rather than formula.\nThe university has traditionally granted full-time members of the tenure-track faculty the right to devote up to an average of one day (of university time) per week to outside, paid, professional activities, where that activity is consistent with that person's role as a member of the faculty and where that activity also enhances the contribution of the faculty member to the university. Such activity benefits both the faculty member and the university. This document extends this traditional consulting privilege of tenure-track faculty to research faculty.\nThe faculty member in participating in such activities must accept the responsibility to arrange his or her work so that during the academic year (and summer, if on salary) the faculty member will devote the appropriate amount of time to activities connected with the primary appointment. In particular, when effort is expended on sponsored research contracts, the faculty person must be aware that, if the effort is 100 percent, the intent of the sponsor is that 100 percent of effort is equivalent to five days of work per week. Thus, consulting activities that occur while being paid 100 percent from research contracts would be in addition to five days of work per week. It follows similarly with other levels of effort, e.g., if 80 percent of effort is on research contracts, the expectation is that four days of work per week will be devoted to those research contracts. It is the responsibility of faculty to ascertain whether their commitment to sponsored research leaves time for consulting. For purposes of accounting, it is to be understood that this standard will be applied, on average, over each three-month period of the academic year and over each month of the summer.\n\u00a0  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It appears in the current issues of the Faculty Handbook and Student Handbook.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Provost. Questions on policy content should be directed to the provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nCarnegie Mellon University applauds and encourages the interest of individuals and groups who wish to work as citizens through political channels for the betterment of society. However, the university as a university is and must remain neutral on political issues.\nIn the light of the active political concerns of the members of the university community, the following guidelines are issued to avoid the improper use of the institution's resources and facilities for political purposes. This is vital for two reasons: (a) to preserve the university's neutrality on political matters and its function as a center for freedom of thought, and (b) to assure that its tax-exempt status is protected.\n\nA member of the faculty or administration (now expanded to include all members and groups of the university community) like any other citizen has the right to express his thinking on controversial public issues and to make it known to others. In doing so, however, he has the responsibility to make clear that he is expressing his individual views and to guard against giving the impression that he is speaking for the university.\nWhen he presents his views to the public, he may identify himself by his academic title and the name of his institution if he wishes to do so, but the fact that he is expressing personal views should nevertheless be made obvious.\nUniversity facilities, e.g., bulletin boards, campus mail, duplicating machines (now expanded to include secretarial services) and office supplies (not including stationery) are provided for the conduct of university business. Occasionally an individual may wish to present his private views about a subject on which he feels deeply. In such case he may use university facilities to express them to others in the campus community, but not to the public.\nIf this use makes only minor demands on these facilities and does not hold up regular university business, it is quite acceptable.\nIf substantial use of these facilities is involved, the individual should schedule this work so that its interference with regular business is minimal and should reimburse the university for the cost of materials and services.\nIf large numbers of messages are planned, and especially if they are to be sent to groups of the public, the work should be done by a commercial organization.\n\n\nIn any case the writer should distinguish such messages from regular university communications in an appropriate way and identify himself as the sender.\nThe following are explanatory and interpretive guidelines governing the application of Organization Announcement 228-B to actions and decisions on the use of Carnegie Mellon University's resources and facilities for political purposes.\n\nOrganization Announcement 228-B applies to all members and groups of the Carnegie Mellon University community.\nOrganization Announcement 228-B should be understood to apply to letters or other written material prepared by individuals or groups in connection with the solicitation of funds and\/or votes for a political candidate or party. To carry out the spirit of this Organization Announcement, it should also be understood to mean that the name or seal or mark of the university or any of its divisions should not be used in the soliciting of funds and\/or votes for a candidate or political party. Similarly, university office, faculty or staff member's office, or student activity office should not be used as a return mailing address for such solicitations.\nAny member of the faculty, staff or administration, or member of the student body engaging in political activity should make it clear that he is representing only himself and not the university. Such activities should not interfere with his obligation to the university.\nIn no sense should Organization Announcement 228-B or these guidelines be interpreted as in any way restricting the scholarly and educational pursuits of members of the university community, nor in any way restricting the freedom of expression or exposure to ideas of any member of the university community.\u00a0\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions about this policy can be directed to Benefits Office, ext 8-2047. Specific questions about the FMLA should be directed to the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Government Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED DOCUMENT:\nCarnegie Mellon Family and Medical Leave\u00a0from the Staff Handbook.\n\n\nRELATED WEBSITE:\nHuman Resources - Leaves of Absence\n\n\n\nYour Rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (including Military Family Leave)\nFMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to \"eligible\" employees for certain family and medical reasons. Employees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least one year, and for 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months, and if there are at least 50 employees within 75 miles.\nReasons for Taking Leave\nUnpaid leave must be granted for any of the following reasons:\n\nto care for the employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care;\nto care for the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition;\nfor a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job; or\nmilitary family leave as described below.\n\nAt the employee's or employer's option, certain kinds of paid leave may be substituted for unpaid leave.\nAdvance Notice and Medical Certification\nThe employee may be required to provide advance leave notice and medical certification. Taking of leave may be denied if requirements are not met.\n\nThe employee ordinarily must provide 30 days advance notice when the leave is \"foreseeable.\"\nAn employer may require medical certification to support a request for leave because of a serious health condition, and may require second or third opinions (at the employer's expense) and a fitness for duty report to return to work.\n\nMilitary Family Leave\nEligible employees are entitled to take unpaid leave in connection with a covered family member's service in the Armed Forces as described below.\u00a0 An employee's rights and obligations regarding military family leave are governed by the University's Family and Medical Leave policy except as otherwise required by law.\nMilitary family leave provides eligible employees unpaid leave for any one, or a combination of the following reasons:\n\nMilitary Caregiver Leave: Eligible employees who are family members of covered service members may take up to 26 workweeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or injury incurred in the line of duty on active duty with the Armed Forces that may render the service member medically unfit to perform his or her duties with the Armed Forces. For purposes of this leave benefit only, eligible employees include the spouse, child, parent or next of kin of a covered service member.\nQualifying Exigencies: Eligible employees may take up to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the spouse, child or parent of the eligible employee is on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or Reserves). Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.\n\nThe duration of military family leave is based on the reason for the leave as described below:\n\nLeave to care for an injured or ill service member, when combined with other FMLA qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks in a single 12 month period.\nMilitary family leave runs concurrent with other leave entitlements provided under federal, state and local law.\nIn cases of a husband and wife using the leave benefits set forth in this section, the leave will be subject to the limitations set forth by the FMLA.\n\nSome states provide additional leave benefits for family members of service members.\u00a0 It is the university's policy to comply with such laws in any circumstances where they apply.\nJob Benefits and Protection\n\nFor the duration of FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employee's health coverage under any \"group health plan.\"\nUpon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.\nThe use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an employee's leave.\n\nUnlawful acts by employers\nFMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:\n\ninterfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under FMLA;\ndischarge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA.\n\nEnforcement\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is authorized to investigate and resolve complaints of violations.\nAn eligible employee may bring a civil action against an employer for violations.\n\nFMLA does not affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local law or collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave rights.\nFor additional information contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Updated in August 2016 to reflect changes in personnel, organization names and revised appendices.\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nTitle IX Coordinator, Dean of Student Affairs, and Associate Vice President for Human Resources. Questions about policy content and process, as well as any reports of alleged violations of this policy may be directed to any of these officials or to the individuals identified in the \u201cResources\u201d section below where contact information is provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy defines sexual harassment and sexual assault and describes procedures for reporting concerns or allegations, and for investigating allegations and taking disciplinary or other corrective actions when a violation is found to have occurred.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of Assurance\n\n\nEqual Opportunity\/Affirmative Action\n\n\nCommunity Standards [The Word]\n\n\nList of Sexual Harassment Advisors [See\u00a0Appendix A below]\n\n\nWhat to do if You or Someone You Know is a Survivor of Sexual Assault or Sexual Violence [See\u00a0Appendix B below]\n\n\nConfidentiality [See Appendix C below]\n\n\nDefinitions [See Appendix D below]\n\n\nBystander Risk Reduction and Sexual Violence Education, Awareness and Prevention [See\u00a0Appendix E below]\n\n\nFreedom of Expression Policy\n\n\nStatement on Academic and Individual Freedom\u00a0[The Word]\n\nOffice of Title IX Initiatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nCarnegie Mellon is dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and the intellectual development of all members of its community. For this exchange and development to take place freely, the institution fosters a positive learning, working, and living environment that promotes the confidence to work, study, innovate and perform without fear of sexual harassment or sexual assault. This policy is intended to clearly identify violations of this standard, provide resources to deal with their effects, and describe detailed procedures to address complaints of sexual harassment, including sexual assault.\u00a0 While these principles are clear and straightforward, the detailed procedures set forth in this document are necessary to assure that these matters are handled in a fair, thoughtful and thorough manner, consistent with our dedication to the integrity of our process.\nI. The Policy\nSexual harassment and sexual assault are specifically prohibited by Carnegie Mellon University, as is retaliation for having brought forward a concern or allegation.\u00a0 This document defines sexual harassment and sexual assault and explains the procedures that are followed when someone reports conduct that is prohibited by this policy.\u00a0 Appendix C also identifies specific resources and actions a victim can choose to take in the immediate aftermath of a sexual assault.\n\"Sexual Harassment\" is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n\nsubmission to such conduct is made either implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or student status in a course, program or activity; or\nsubmission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or educational decisions affecting such individual; or\nsuch conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work or educational performance; or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working and\/or learning environment; or of interfering with one's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity.\n\nSexual harassment includes \"Sexual Assault\" and any other forms of sexual violence, including any physical sexual act perpetrated against a person's will, where that person does not give clear and voluntary consent, or where that person is incapable of giving consent due to drug or alcohol use, or due to intellectual or other disability.\u00a0 Sexual assault includes but is not limited to rape, sexual battery, sexual coercion (the act of using pressure or force to have sexual contact with someone who has already refused), dating violence, domestic violence and any other act of sexual violence.\u00a0\u00a0\nSexual harassment also includes acts of stalking that create a sexually hostile or threatening environment. Sexual harassment can occur in many different contexts.\u00a0 Sexual harassment can occur between members of opposite sexes and\/or members of the same sex.\u00a0 Sexual harassment often involves a supervisory employment relationship or teacher \/ student relationship.\u00a0 However, sexual harassment can also be committed by a student against a faculty member, by an employee against a supervisor, by a member of one's peer group, or by a contractor, vendor or other visitor to the University community.\u00a0 A hostile environment can also be created by the actions of more than one person or a group.\nThis policy is consistent with the free expression of ideas that is essential to the mission of the University, and the University believes that discourse conducted in accordance with the University's Freedom of Expression Policy and with the statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University, whether in written, spoken, or electronic forms, will be consistent with this policy.\nUnder federal, state, and local legislation (including but not limited to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972), the University has an affirmative duty to devise and adopt appropriate policies and procedures prohibiting sexual harassment and sexual assault, including prevention and education programs; to investigate claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault; and to take prompt remedial action to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence.\u00a0 Any faculty member, student, staff employee, vendor or visitor found to have violated this policy by engaging in conduct constituting sexual harassment or sexual assault will be subject to appropriate disciplinary or corrective action, which may include but not be limited to dismissal, expulsion, termination of employment, termination of contract, removal from campus, or other revocation of privileges on campus.\nFor this policy to be meaningful, members of the University community who are aware of conduct that violates this policy, whether they observe the conduct directly or otherwise learn about it, should report it to one of the individuals listed in the \"Resources\" section below.\u00a0 Managers and supervisors in particular are obligated by this policy and the law to report such conduct to one of the sexual harassment advisors or Title IX coordinators identified below to assure that the matter is investigated and that appropriate corrective action is taken.\u00a0 Anyone who has questions or concerns about whether his or her status with the University creates an obligation to make a report should consult with the Title IX Coordinators or Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators identified in Section II below.\nHealth Services and Counseling and Psychological Services personnel are bound by the law and their professional codes of ethics with regard to the confidentiality of information learned in the course of rendering care, and thus are not mandatory reporters for purposes of this policy.\nRetaliation is also prohibited by this policy.\u00a0 No person will be reprimanded or retaliated against in any way for initiating an inquiry or lodging a complaint in good faith regarding sexual harassment or sexual assault.\u00a0\u00a0 Any conduct constituting such a reprimand or retaliation is itself a violation of this policy and is equally subject to disciplinary action under it. Any person subjected to conduct perceived as a reprimand or retaliation for initiating an inquiry or lodging a complaint in good faith regarding sexual harassment or sexual assault should promptly report all relevant information to one of the responsible individuals identified in the \"Resources\" section below.\u00a0\nIf it is discovered that a complaint is knowingly initiated in bad faith, the University may initiate separate disciplinary action.\nII.\u00a0 Resources:\u00a0 People Who Handle Complaints and Oversee Compliance with this Policy\ufeff1\nThere are numerous resources available to anyone who believes that he or she has been the victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault, or has witnessed sexual harassment or sexual assault. Below are the names and contact information for the University's Title IX Coordinators, Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators, and lists of the advisors trained to deal with matters of alleged sexual harassment and sexual assault.\u00a0 These individuals can provide information about the processes under this policy for dealing with concerns and complaints, and information about other resources that may be available to victims of sexual harassment and\/or sexual assault.\u00a0 If you believe that you have been the victim of sexual harassment and\/or sexual assault or you are aware of such conduct, you are encouraged to make contact with any of the individuals identified below and in the appendices.\u00a0 They will make certain that your complaint is communicated to the appropriate resource for handling.\nTitle IX Coordinators.\u00a0 The Title IX Coordinators are responsible for, among other things, overseeing complaints of sexual harassment and assault brought forward under this policy to assure that these matters are being handled appropriately and effectively, and for identifying and addressing patterns of sexual harassment \/ assault and systemic problems.\u00a0 The following individuals serve as the University's Title IX Coordinators, and are available to speak with anyone who wishes to bring forward a concern or complaint under this policy.\u00a0\n\nInterim Director of Title IX Initiatives and Title IX Coordinator: Holly Hippensteel, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, hbh@andrew.cmu.edu, 412-268-2075, West Wing Suite 102, or 325 Warner Hall.\nDeputy Title IX Coordinator for Students: \u00a0Jamie Edwards, jaedward@andrew.cmu.edu,\u00a0412-268-7125, West Wing Suite 102\nDeputy Title IX Coordinator for Faculty:\u00a0 Amy Burkert, Vice Provost for Education, ak11@andrew.cmu.edu, 412-268-5865, 411\u00a0Warner Hall\nDeputy Title IX Coordinator for Staff:\u00a0 Everett Tademy, Assistant Vice President for Diversity and Equal Opportunity Services, et19@cmu.edu, 412-268-1018, 200 Whitfield Hall\nDeputy Title IX Coordinator for Athletics: Kimberly Kelly,\u00a0Athletics and Physical Education,\u00a0akelly@andrew.cmu.edu, 412-268-2193, Skibo Gymnasium\n\nSexual Harassment Advisors.\u00a0 In support of its commitment to maintain an environment free of sexual harassment, the University makes sexual harassment advising as widely available as possible. To that end, the university assigns special responsibility to the individuals identified in Appendix A who serve as sexual harassment advisors.\u00a0 These advisors include faculty, staff and administrators trained to deal with incidents of sexual harassment.\nSexual Harassment Process Coordinators. In addition to the Title IX Coordinators identified above, the coordination of formal complaints against faculty or staff that are processed under this policy is entrusted, under the authority of the President, to the following officers:\n\nSexual Harassment Process Coordinator for Faculty:\u00a0 Laurie Weingart, Interim Provost, weingart@cmu.edu, 412-268-3363, 607\u00a0Warner Hall\nSexual Harassment Process Coordinator for Staff: Michelle Piekutowski, Associate Vice President for Human Resources and Chief Human Resources Officer, mpie@andrew.cmu.edu, 412-268-5523, 104 Whitfield Hall\n\nUniversity Police.\u00a0 Victims of sexual harassment and\/or assault may contact the University Police 24 hours a day at 412-268-2323 to discuss the possibility of filing a criminal complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 Even if law enforcement authorities investigate or take other action, victims still have the right to pursue claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault through the procedures outlined in this policy.\nEthics Reporting Hotline. If a community member is not comfortable contacting one of the resources above, concerns and allegations under this policy may also be reported through the University's confidential ethics reporting hotline at www.reportit.net (login: tartans | password: plaid). Please note that it is important to provide sufficient detail in your report so that the University is able to take appropriate and meaningful action.\nQuestions regarding the application of Title IX to the University's programs or concerns regarding this policy or the handling of complaints under this policy may also be referred to the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education at 800-421-3481 or by e-mail to OCR@ed.gov.\n\n\ufeff1Effective August 2016, the role of the Survivor Support Network (SSN) changed and it is no longer designated as a resource for reporting or handling complaints under this policy.\n\nIII.\u00a0 The Processes for Handling Complaints\nBecause this Policy governs the conduct of all members of the Carnegie Mellon community (including faculty, staff, students, vendors, contractors and visitors), there are different procedures for addressing complaints under the policy depending on who has allegedly violated the policy.\u00a0 Where the individual against whom an allegation is made (hereinafter \"respondent\") is a student, cases are handled through the University Student Community Standards Process outlined in the Student Handbook.\u00a0 Where the respondent is a faculty or staff member, cases are handled through the Sexual Harassment Process outlined below. Where the respondent has dual status (e.g., more than one status), or where there are multiple respondents with varying statuses, the University has discretion to determine whether to pursue the matter through the Student Community Standards Process or the Sexual Harassment Process, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where the respondent is a vendor\/contractor or visitor, the University reserves the right to determine what process to follow and is not required to adhere to any of the procedures outlined in either the University Student Community Standards Process or the Sexual Harassment Process below.\u00a0 In cases involving vendors\/contractors and visitors, the University reserves the right to take summary action.\nIt is important to note that certain forms of sexual assault and violence may constitute criminal conduct.\u00a0 Whether or not someone who has been subjected to this conduct chooses to pursue criminal charges externally, they also have the right to pursue a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual assault through the internal processes outlined herein, regardless of the status of any external proceedings.\u00a0 Moreover, the University may have an obligation to pursue an investigation, make a complaint and take disciplinary action directly, even if a victim chooses not to pursue the matter internally at the University.\u00a0 This may also be true where a victim is not a member of our community but makes allegations under this policy that give rise to an obligation on the part of the University to safeguard the members of our community.\u00a0 In such cases where the victim is not a member of our community, the University reserves the right to take action under this policy or take other action as may be necessary and appropriate to fulfill the University's obligation to safeguard our community.\nGeneral Procedural Principles Applicable to all Cases.\u00a0 For all matters that follow the Student Community Standards Process or the Sexual Harassment Process outlined below, the following general principles shall govern all procedures (whether informal or formal) under this policy, to the extent consistent with the University's legal obligations.\n\nProcedures are to be fair, both in substance and in perception, to all persons concerned, to the various constituencies, and to the Carnegie Mellon community.\nAll persons concerned are to be treated with respect and impartiality.\nThe University recognizes the importance of confidentiality in handling claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault.\u00a0 In the handling of inquiries and complaints made under this policy, the University will protect confidentiality to the extent consistent with the University's legal obligations to take all reasonable steps to conduct an effective investigation of claims and to protect the welfare of the campus community.\nInformal resolution of allegations of sexual harassment is in certain cases the best and most productive outcome.\u00a0 The University recognizes, however, that OCR has taken the position that mediation is not an appropriate mechanism for resolution in cases of alleged sexual assault \/ violence.\nWhen a formal complaint is processed, both parties must be provided access to all charges, claims, and other relevant information that will be used at a hearing, and both parties shall have an equal opportunity to present relevant witnesses and other evidence.\nPersons providing advice or called upon to investigate allegations of sexual harassment will be thoughtfully chosen and properly trained.\nAll procedures should be implemented as expeditiously as is consistent with their integrity and fairness.\nDuring the pendency of an investigation or proceedings under this policy, the University may be required to take immediate action to safeguard the University community.\u00a0 In the case of students, that may require a no-contact order, suspension, or removal from campus.\u00a0 In other cases, that may involve a suspension of employment pending conclusion of the investigation and proceedings under this policy.\u00a0\nIf, prior to resolution of a complaint under this policy, a student who is a survivor of sexual assault is concerned about the safety of her\/his living situation and lives in a university residence facility, the student may request to be moved to an alternate location\nThe University may also assist with reasonable and appropriate academic accommodations where possible.\n\nSpecific Procedures for Cases Where the Respondent is a Student.\u00a0 As indicated above, cases involving allegations against a student will be handled in accordance with the University Student Community Standards Process, which is set forth in the community standards section of The Word.\u00a0 These procedures can be found at the following link:\u00a0 http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/student-affairs\/theword\/\/comm_standards\/index.html\nSpecific Procedures for Cases Where the Respondent is Faculty or Staff.\u00a0 In these cases, informal or formal procedures may be followed.\nInformal Procedures: In cases where the respondent is faculty or staff (not a student, vendor\/contractor or visitor), one of the Title IX Coordinators or Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators will promptly endeavor to thoroughly review the matter with the person making the allegations to determine whether sexual harassment or sexual assault appears to have occurred, and proceed to take or recommend appropriate action. Such action may include an informal agreement or mediated resolution. These terms of an informal agreement or mediated resolution necessarily include an agreement to stop the behaviors at issue, but often include other terms \/ measures that may be appropriate in the circumstances and necessary to protect the complainant and safeguard the campus community.\u00a0 Mediation will not be pursued in cases where OCR has indicated that it is not an appropriate mechanism for resolution.\u00a0 At any time during the informal process, the complainant has the right to end the informal process and proceed with a formal complaint.\nFormal Complaint Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 A person who believes that she or he has been subjected to sexual harassment, including sexual assault, may choose, either initially or after having sought an informal resolution, to lodge a formal complaint. Victims are encouraged to lodge a formal complaint (if they intend to do so)\u00a0 as soon as possible, but at least within one year after the most recent conduct alleged to constitute sexual harassment. Although the University does not impose a limitations period for reviewing internal complaints of alleged sexual harassment\/sexual assault, the University recognizes that to conduct a meaningful investigation of allegations of sexual harassment or sexual assault and to take prompt remedial action as appropriate, a timely complaint is important.\u00a0 The lodging and processing of a formal complaint does not preclude the possibility of an informal or mediated resolution of the matter.\nAnyone considering lodging a formal complaint should contact one of the individuals identified in the \"Resources\" section above.\u00a0 Merely discussing an intended complaint with one of these individuals does not commit one to actually lodging the formal complaint, although the University may be required in cases where the welfare of the broader community is at issue to proceed with an investigation and lodging its own complaint even if the victim chooses not to file a complaint.\nOnce a formal complaint has been filed, the following procedures will apply:\n\nThe formal complaint procedure is initiated by a person, here termed the \"complainant\", lodging with a Title IX Coordinator or Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator a written, signed complaint, containing the relevant allegations against the \"respondent\", and requesting an investigation under the procedures provided below. (Throughout this policy, the terms complainant and respondent include their respective plurals, unless the context clearly refers to an individual.)\nNeither the complainant nor the respondent may be represented by legal counsel at the formal proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe procedure will be managed by one of the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators; as a rule, this coordinator will be the Provost if the respondent is a faculty member, and the Associate Vice President of Human Resources if the respondent is a staff member.\nThe Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator shall convene a committee of investigation and shall inform the complainant and the respondent of the committee's identity and charge, providing the respondent with a copy of the formal complaint.\nThe committee of investigation shall consist of four members, drawn from pools of university community members. For purposes of this policy, \"groups\" are defined as faculty, staff, and students.\u00a0 Hence, where the complainant and respondent are both from the same group, the committee shall consist of 4 members drawn from the pool for that group.\u00a0 And, where the complainant and respondent are from different groups, the committee shall consist of 2 members from each of the 2 groups. Where there are multiple complainants and\/or respondents who are not all in the same group, the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator shall adjust the composition of the committee as appropriate to achieve balance, and may, if it is essential for this purpose, increase the membership of the committee.\nThe pool from which members of the committees of investigation are to be drawn consists of members of the University community selected by the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators and provided with appropriate training. The selection is made periodically from faculty members nominated by the Chair of the Faculty Organization, students nominated by the President of the Graduate Student Assembly and the Chair of the Student Senate, and staff members nominated by the Chair of the Staff Council, as well as members of the university administration nominated by the AVP for Human Resources.\u00a0 The number of pool members from each group is determined from time to time by the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators, but the pool should at all times contain, if possible, at least twenty-four individuals: eight faculty members, eight students, and eight staff members.\nThe great importance of confidentiality in the (informal and formal) processes described in this policy is underscored by requiring each member of the pool to sign a pledge to respect and to preserve the confidentiality of their work. If called to serve on a Committee of Investigation, no one may serve without first signing the pledge.\nNone of the individuals identified in the \"Resources\" section above shall be members of the committee of investigation, but an experienced sexual harassment advisor shall serve as non-voting moderator of the committee and shall provide it with his or her expert advice.\nThe complainant and the respondent may object, for cause, to the appointment of a specific person or specific persons as member or members of the committee of investigation. The convening Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator shall consider the objection and, if it is accepted, shall appoint a replacement for the affected member or members of the committee.\n\nThe function of the committee of investigation is to conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations in the complaint, with a view to:\ndetermining whether any conduct alleged in the complaint did occur in the manner and circumstances alleged or otherwise; and\nto the extent that the alleged conduct did occur, determining whether this conduct constitutes sexual harassment or sexual assault.\n\nWith regard to any sexual harassment or sexual assault found by the committee of investigation to have occurred, the committee shall make a considered recommendation regarding appropriate action consistent with the applicable university policies.\n\n\nIn the conduct of its investigation, the committee of investigation shall have broad access to all potentially relevant documentation, and shall hold a hearing. The committee shall make available to the complainant and to the respondent, before the hearing, the documentation in its possession that the committee regards as relevant to the complaint. All the information provided before, or elicited at, the hearing is to be regarded as confidential and treated accordingly.\nThe conduct of the hearing is under the exclusive control of the committee of investigation. Its proceedings are not those of a court of law. In the interest of confidentiality, the hearing is not public, and the complainant (or each individual complainant if there are more than one) as well as the respondent (or each individual respondent) may be accompanied at the hearing by at most one other person of his or her choice.\u00a0 This individual may not be a legal representative. This person may, but is not required to, be a sexual harassment advisor. The complainant and the respondent may confer with the respective accompanying person, but that person may not address the hearing unless called as a witness, and then only in that capacity. Unless permitted to be present throughout the proceedings in a capacity as complainant, respondent, or accompanying person, a witness may be present only while testifying.\n\nThe committee of investigation shall conduct the hearing as soon as practical. Complainant and respondent shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing by telephone and confirmed by e-mail.\nIn making its findings, the committee shall use the preponderance of the evidence standard (e.g., more likely than not).\u00a0 If further proceedings are initiated regarding sanctions, the standards of evidence set forth in the applicable policies shall govern. The complainant (or any individual complainant for him or herself only) may withdraw the complaint by notifying the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator in writing, at any time before the opening of the hearing; after the hearing has begun, the complaint may be withdrawn only with the consent of either the coordinator or the respondent.\u00a0\u00a0 Where a complainant withdraws a complaint, the University may elect to pursue the matter serving as complainant as necessary to fulfill the University's obligation to conduct a full investigation and take remedial action in order to safeguard the University community.\nAfter concluding its investigation, the committee of investigation shall make findings and recommendations by a majority vote.\u00a0 These findings and recommendations shall be documented in a written report which shall be submitted to the convening Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator and the timing of that submission shall be communicated to the complainant, the respondent, and the President. The report shall record any significant dissent with the committee's findings or recommendations, but not the names of the members dissenting. If the committee is unable to reach a decision by a majority regarding the central findings and recommendations to be made, the committee shall so notify the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator, and the Coordinator shall proceed to convene a new committee to investigate the matter.\u00a0 The newly convened committee shall have wide latitude in conducting its own investigation and may consider and give such weight to the record made before the prior committee as it deems appropriate in its discretion, or the new committee may investigate the matter de novo.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the case of staff respondents, the convening Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator shall evaluate the findings of the committee of investigation and its recommendation, and shall render a final decision and take appropriate action in accordance with the provisions of this Policy and other applicable university policies.\u00a0 The Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator's decision to accept or reject the recommendation of the committee of investigation as well as the basis for that decision shall be communicated in writing to the complainant, the respondent, the President, and the members of the committee of investigation.\u00a0 The matter shall then be concluded with no further process or appeal.\nIn the case of faculty respondents, the convening Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator shall evaluate the findings of the committee of investigation, and shall recommend appropriate action to the President, based on that evaluation, in accordance with the provisions of this Policy and other applicable university policies, including the Appointment and Tenure policy.\u00a0 The Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator's recommendation, shall be communicated in writing to the President and the timing of that submission shall be communicated to the complainant the respondent and the members of the committee of investigation.\nThe President will thereafter render a decision based on both the recommendation of the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator as well as the underlying findings and recommendation of the committee of investigation.\u00a0 The President's decision to accept or reject the recommendation of the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator as well as the basis for that decision shall be communicated in writing to the complainant, respondent, Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator and committee of investigation.\u00a0\u00a0 If the President decides to initiate the procedure for dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction against a faculty respondent, the matter will then follow the process set forth in the subsection \"Procedure\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University titled, \"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\", but will be subject to the \"Exceptions\" provision of that subsection such that no Ad-Hoc Committee will be required.\n\n\nThe processing of a formal complaint shall adhere to the following timetable:\n\nSelection of committee of investigation: 5 working days following receipt of the complaint.\nScheduling of hearing: 5 working days.\nCommittee investigation and hearing: At the time of scheduling the hearing the Coordinator, after consulting the complainant, the respondent, and the committee of investigation, shall in each case set in writing a reasonable time period for the committee's investigation and the hearing with a view toward prompt resolution.\u00a0\nPreparation of committee report: 10 working days following the conclusion of the hearing.\nSexual Harassment Process Coordinator's evaluation and decisions or recommendations: 10 working days.\n\nIf it appears to the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator that an extension of one or more of these time periods is essential to safeguard the integrity and fairness of the process, he or she shall determine a reasonable time period for such an extension, and shall document in writing the reasons for the extension and communicate them to all persons involved in each specific stage of the process to which the extension applies. When an extension of the time period allotted to the committee's investigation and hearing is contemplated, the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator must consult the complainant, the respondent, and the committee of investigation before making a decision.\nTo justify the necessary confidence in the integrity of the formal complaint procedure, the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator handling the complaint, as well as the members of the committee of investigation if one is convened, are required to conduct all proceedings relating to the complaint with scrupulous regard for fairness, both in substance and in perception, to the complainant, the respondent, and the university community.\nA critical instance demanding attention to this requirement of fairness is the Coordinator's choice of members of a committee of investigation. The Coordinator will ensure a balanced membership as the make-up of the committee is determined.\nThe lodging and processing of a formal complaint does not preclude the Title IX Coordinators or Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators from pursuing, at the request of the respondent or otherwise, reasonable efforts to reach an informal or mediated resolution of the matter, consistent with the principles of this policy.\n\n\nSanctions.\u00a0 Appropriate sanctions will be imposed for violation of this Policy.\u00a0 The sanctions will depend on the circumstances and the gravity of the violation, and may range from reprimand to dismissal, expulsion, or termination.\nThe decision to impose sanctions and the procedure for imposing them shall conform: in the case of a members of the regular, research, teaching, librarian, or special faculty, to the provisions of the section on \"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\" of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University (except that action regarding such a person's administrative appointments is at the discretion of the President); in the case of a student, whether undergraduate, graduate, or non-degree, to the provisions in the section on Community Standards in the Student Handbook; in the case of a staff member, to the provisions in the section on Staff Relations in the Staff Handbook, unless superseded by the provisions of an applicable collective bargaining agreement. In the case of vendors\/contractors or visitors, the decision will be made by the unit responsible for the contract \/ relationship in consultation with such University administrators as are appropriate under the circumstances.\nFollowing completion of the formal sexual harassment complaint procedure, when an individual respondent is a faculty member, if the president decides to initiate against that faculty member the procedure for dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction (as described in the subsection \"Procedure\" of the section of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University titled, \"Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions\"), the procedure is then subject to the \"Exceptions\" provision of that subsection, thus precluding the Ad-Hoc Committee stage.\nIV.\u00a0 Annual Report\nThe Title IX Coordinator and Sexual Harassment Process Coordinators shall provide the President, the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate, the Executive Committee of Staff Council, the Student Senate Chair and President of the Graduate Student Organization with an annual confidential report, detailing the number and disposition of different types of incidents, allegations, and complaints of sexual harassment that have come to their attention during the past year.\u00a0 This report shall be in addition to the Clery Act reporting or other reporting obligations of the University.\n\nAppendix A:\u00a0 Sexual Harassment Advisors\n\n\n\nAmy Burkert, Vice Provost for Education\nWarner Hall 411, 286-5865\nak11@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nHolly Hippensteel, Assistant Dean, Student Affairs\nWarner Hall, 325, 268-2075\nhbh@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nDavid Krackhardt, Professor of Organization & Public Policy\nHamburg Hall 2112B, 268-4758\nkrack@cmu.edu\n\n\nSuzie Laurich-McIntyre, Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education\nWarner Hall 533, 268-7307\nsuzannel@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nCarole Panno, Senior Associate Director of Annual Giving\nPPG 6, 14th floor, 268-1617\ncp1g@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nSusan Polansky, Head, Modern Languages and Teaching Professor\nBaker Hall 168, 268-2868\nsp3e@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\n\nScott Sandage, Associate Professor of History\n\nBaker Hall 236, 268-2878\nsandage@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\n\nGloriana St. Clair, Dean, University Libraries Emerita\n\nHunt Library Administrative Offices, 268-2447\ngstclair@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nKaren Stump, Director, Undergraduate Studies and Chemistry Teaching Professor\nDoherty Hall 1316, 268-3340\nks01@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nKurt Kumler, Director, Counseling and Psychological Services\nMorewood Gardens E-Tower, 268-2922\nkkumler @cmu.edu\n\n\nEverett Tademy, Assistant Vice President for Diversity and Equal Opportunity Services\nWhitfield Hall 200, 268-1018 or 412-243-2950 (home)\net19@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nAmy Barry, Director, Human Resource Services\nUTDC 322A, 268-5081\nabarry@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\nGloria Gruber, Director, University Advancement Organizational Development\nPPG, 14th floor, 268-9685\nggruber@andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\n\n\nAppendix B:\u00a0 What To Do If You Or Someone You Know Is A Survivor of Sexual Assault or Sexual Violence?\nThe following procedures are recommended if you or someone you know is a victim of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence or stalking:\nGet to a safe place \u2013 Following an assault, the primary concern is to get the survivor to a safe place. Once there, the survivor has several options to consider.\nContact someone that she\/he can trust \u2013 Such as a friend, family member, University Police, your resident assistant or housefellow.\nConsider seeking medical attention \u2013 All survivors of sexual assault are encouraged to seek medical attention as soon as possible after the assault to ensure their physical well-being. University Police can provide transport to University Health Services or a local hospital by calling 8-2323\/412-268-2323. Even if there is no external physical injury, survivors can be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy and internal trauma.\nTry to preserve physical evidence \u2013 The preservation of physical evidence is important to the successful criminal prosecution of offenders. In order to preserve evidence of sexual assault, survivors should not shower, douche or change clothes or bedding before seeking medical attention. All clothing items should be placed in a paper bag and taken to the hospital. Also, if oral contact was made, survivors are asked not to brush their teeth, smoke or eat. Evidence can be collected at area hospitals, including Magee Women\u2019s Hospital, 412-641-1000 and UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, 412-647-3333. In instances of physical or sexual assault, consider taking photographs of injuries or asking someone else to do so.\nIf a survivor chooses, contact University Police and\/or Pittsburgh Police \u2013 Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking are crimes, and survivors have the opportunity to press charges and\/or pursue action through the university. Survivors may contact Carnegie Mellon University Police at 8-2323\/412-268-2323 or the Sexual Assault Unit of the Pittsburgh Police at 412-323-7141. Survivors have the right to decline to contact local law enforcement authorities. If survivors choose to contact law enforcement, University Police Department Staff and other university officials listed in the report will assist survivors in doing so.\nIf a survivor chooses not to go through the criminal justice system or wishes to pursue university charges, there are disciplinary and non-disciplinary options available at Carnegie Mellon University. A survivor can discuss on-campus procedures by contacting the Office of Title IX Initiatives at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu.\nConsider contacting a counselor or support organization \u2013 Counselors are available through the campus Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) at 8-2922\/412-268-2922, Pittsburgh Action Against Rape\u2019s 24-hour help line at 1-866-363-7273, or the Women\u2019s Center and Shelter at 412-687-8005. Visits to University Health Services for medical treatment and CaPS for counseling are confidential. Conversations with University Health Services clinicians and counselors are not disclosed to anyone without the expressed permission of the person seeking assistance unless there is a threat of physical harm to that individual or others.\nUpdated:\u00a0 January 2016\nAppendix C: Confidentiality\nLimitations on Confidentiality\nConsistent with its duties under Title IX, the University is committed to promptly responding to reports of sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking in a way that limits the effects and prevents recurrence. Because Carnegie Mellon is committed to ensuring that such reports are investigated and appropriately responded to, there are limits on the level of confidentiality that can be provided by officials of Carnegie Mellon.\nThe resources listed Section II of the Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault, as well as the resources listed in Appendices A, B, and C cannot guarantee confidentiality. Depending on the information shared, the university may have an obligation to safeguard the welfare of the campus community through further investigation or by taking appropriate remedial action.\nConfidential Reporting Options\nCarnegie Mellon University maintains many resources for reporting incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking or other violations of the university\u2019s Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault. As discussed above; however, because the university is committed to ensuring that such reports are investigated and appropriately responded to, there are limits on the level of confidentiality that can be provided by officials of Carnegie Mellon.\nCarnegie Mellon understands that some survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking may not be ready or may not be willing to report through a channel that may lead to an investigation or other university action, no matter how discreet. For such individuals, Carnegie Mellon maintains several confidential reporting options. Unlike the resources listed in Section II of the Policy or Appendices A, B and C, the resources below can provide confidentiality.\n\nCampus Resources\nCounseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) \u2013 412-268-2922, http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/counseling\/\nUniversity Health Services \u2013 412-268-2157, http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/health-services\/\n\n\n\nCommunity Resources\nWomen's Shelter and Center of Greater Pittsburgh, http:\/\/www.wcspittsburgh.org\nPittsburgh Action Against Rape, http:\/\/paar.net\nCenter for Victims, http:\/\/www.centerforvictims.org\/GetHelpNow.aspx\n\n\nIn addition, Carnegie Mellon maintains an Ethics Reporting Hotline where members of the Carnegie Mellon community or the public may report violations of the law or university Policy. The Ethics Reporting Hotline includes an anonymous reporting option. Although the Ethics Reporting Hotline may be used to file an anonymous report, the hotline does not provide counseling or other support services to anonymous reporters. The Ethics Hotline is not an emergency service.\n\nReports may be submitted to the Ethics Reporting Hotline by calling 1-877-700-7050 or visiting www.reportit.net.

When a proposed use is not permitted by license and does not fall within one of the specific exceptions, it may still be permitted under the fair use doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107.\u00a0 Appendix A to this policy contains guidance to assist university community members in determining whether a use qualifies as a fair use.  5. When a proposed use of copyright material does not fall within the fair use doctrine and is not otherwise permitted by license or exception, written permission from the copyright owner is required to engage in use.\nAppendix A: Guidance on Fair Use Standards\nBackground\nThe ability to reuse pre-existing copyrighted materials is central to the mission of the University in the 21st Century.\u00a0 A faculty member might wish to include a quotation in a book or distribute an article to her students through a course website.\u00a0 A student might want to create a multimedia project incorporating images, film clips, and music samples for a class assignment.\u00a0 A librarian may seek to digitally preserve archival material.\u00a0 The Copyright Act contains many exceptions and limitations that permit the use of a work without the permission of the copyright owner, most notably fair use. Although these exceptions have always been important to the academic enterprise, the digital revolution enables a wide range of new uses that significantly enhance the educational and scholarly process, thereby increasing the reliance on these exceptions generally, and fair use in particular.\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the objectives of the fair use doctrine are to preserve free speech and to promote creativity. Codified in the Copyright Act of 1976 at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107, the preamble to the fair use doctrine lists six favored purposes: criticism, comment, teaching, scholarship, and research. For this reason, the Supreme Court has recognized that \"the fair use defense affords considerable latitude for scholarship and comment.\"\u00a0\nAfter the preamble, Section 107 sets forth four non-exclusive factors courts must consider in determining whether a use is fair. Courts have broadened their interpretation of the four factors significantly over time. Recent interpretations have favored educational uses involving new technologies.\nWhen conducting a fair use analysis, members of the University community should consider (1) the fair use factors and (2) applicable codes of best practices.\u00a0 The following guidance is designed to assist members of the University community in conducting a proper fair use analysis.1\n1. The Fair Use Factors\nMembers of the University community are required by Section 107 to consider and balance the following factors to determine if a use qualifies as a fair use. The factors should not be balanced mechanically, but weighed together \"in light of the purposes of copyright.\" The ultimate test of fair use \"is whether copyright's goal of promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it.\"\n\nThe purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\n\nCourts have favored nonprofit education uses, including making multiple copies for classroom use, and \"transformative\" uses where the new use does not supersede the originally intended use.\nThe repurposing or re-contextualization of a work can be transformative, even if the work itself is not modified.\nDigitization of works to provide access to the print disabled, to enable indexing, and to enable \"non-consumptive research\" (e.g. text mining) has been considered transformative.\n\n\nNature of the copyrighted work.\n\nCourts have favored uses of factual works, as opposed to fiction, and uses of published works as opposed to unpublished works.\nIf a use is transformative, the nature of the work is less important.\n\n\nAmount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\n\nMinimal copying does not trigger infringement liability and thus does not require fair use analysis.\nThe extent of permissible copying under fair use varies with the purpose and character of the use.\nCopying an entire work may be permissible if necessary to achieve a legitimate purpose. For example, the copying of entire works did not weight against fair use when necessary for the purpose of providing access to the print disabled or providing a search index to complete works.\nCopying of a quantitatively small portion of a work can weigh against fair use if the portion used is \"the heart\" of the work.\nThe inclusion of one chapter of a book in electronic course reserves did not weigh against fair use even when the publisher made available licenses for digital excerpts.\n\n\nThe effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nAlthough in the past this factor was considered to be the most important in the fair use analysis, this no longer is true.\nCourts examine whether the secondary use usurps the market for the original work.\nWith respect to impact on potential licensing revenue, courts look at \"traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets.\"\nMarkets for transformative uses are not traditional markets; hence, a transformative use does not impair the market for purposes of this factor.\nEven when a court concluded a use was non-transformative, it considered the adverse impact on a licensing market only if the license was easily accessible, reasonably priced, and available for the portion and format the user sought to use.\n\n\nGood Faith of User\n\nSome courts have identified a fifth, non-statutory factor: whether the user acted in good faith.\nThis factor should typically weigh in favor of nonprofit educational uses.\nDocumentation of the user's fair use analysis, such as a fair use checklist or a statement of pedagogical need, demonstrates the user's good faith.\n\nAlthough copyright law generally does not require a user to attribute the source of material, such attribution demonstrates the user's good faith.\u00a0 (Attribution often also is required as a matter of academic ethics as well as the terms of a Creative Commons license.)\n\nIn addition, courts have treated as fair use:\n\nCopying incidental to the streaming of films assigned for courses2;\nInclusion of chapters of monographs (but not textbooks) in electronic course reserves3; and\nMass digitization of books for the purpose of preservation, creating a search index, and providing access to the print disabled.4\n\nWhen considering similar uses, members of the University community should treat these decisions as important guideposts.\n2. Best Practices\nSeveral educational communities have developed codes of best practices in fair use.5 These codes each represent a community's consensus about acceptable practices for the fair use of copyrighted materials.\u00a0 Legal scholarship has demonstrated that courts give weight to what a relevant community considers to be acceptable practice.\u00a0 When exercising the fair use doctrine, members of the University community should consult and follow the appropriate code of best practices.\nIn particular, the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Academic and Research Libraries (see link below) articulates a set of principles for how fair use applies to certain common practices in the university setting.\u00a0 The Code sets forth limitations that should be observed to assure that the case for fair use is strong, and enhancements that could further strengthen that case.\u00a0 These principles include that it is fair use to:\n\nMake appropriately tailored course-related content available to enrolled students via digital networks;\nMake digital copies for purposes of preservation, and to make these copies available as surrogates for fragile and inaccessible materials;\nCreate digital versions of a library's special collections and to make these versions electronically accessible in appropriate contexts;\nReproduce materials in accessible formats for disabled students when fully accessible copies are not readily available for commercial sources;\nReceive material for an institutional repository, and to make deposited works publicly available;\nDevelop digital databases to enable non-consumptive analysis for scholarly and reference purposes, including search; and\nCreate collections of websites and other material from the Internet and to make them available for scholarly use.\n\nThe enhancements often involve the use of technological measures to restrict access to the appropriate set of users, and to prevent unnecessarily broad dissemination.\u00a0 Like the judicial determinations of fair use, this Code of Best Practices should inform the fair use calculus performed by members of the University community.6\nAlthough the judicial decisions and the Codes of Best Practices are instructive, members of the University must consider the application of the fair use doctrine to the unique facts of the proposed used.\n\nFootnotes\n[1] This guidance contains citations to some more recent court decisions.\u00a0 For the sake of brevity not all legal principles in this guidance contain citations.\u00a0 Please contact the Office of the General Counsel if you have any questions regarding this guidance.\n[2] Association for Info.

Questions on policy content should be directed to the\u00a0Computer and Network Security Coordinator, ext. 8-8170.\n\n\n\nDate of Issuance:\nApproved by the President's Council on May 16, 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0RELATED POLICIES:\nAcademic Integrity\nAppointment and Tenure Policy Community Standards for Students Conflict of Interest\/CommitmentFair Use Policy Freedom of ExpressionInformation Security Policy  Intellectual Property Policy Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual AssaultPrivacy Rights of Students  Separation of Individual's and Institution's Interests\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nThe purpose of this policy is to set forth guidelines so that members of our community may use the campus network and computing facilities in ways that are responsible and respectful of privacy.\u00a0 This policy sets forth the university\u2019s expectations of acceptable behavior on the part of computer systems users at Carnegie Mellon by providing guidelines for appropriate use of computing and related communication systems and examples of inappropriate use. These standards of acceptable behavior also extend beyond the campus community into the Internet.\u00a0 Just as it is unacceptable to violate others\u2019 rights to privacy, property and resources within Carnegie Mellon, it is also unacceptable to violate those rights on systems that are not at Carnegie Mellon but are accessible through Carnegie Mellon\u2019s connection to the Internet.  This policy applies to all users of Carnegie Mellon computing systems, including students, faculty and staff, and any others granted the use of university computing resources. It applies to the use of all computing facilities owned, leased, operated or contracted by Carnegie Mellon University.\u00a0 As used in this policy, terms such as \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccomputing\/communications systems,\u201d \u201ccomputing resources,\u201d etc., refer to all computers, communication systems, and peripherals, software, telephones and systems with similar functions, which are owned by Carnegie Mellon, or which utilize Carnegie Mellon infrastructure such as telephone lines or computer networks.  Although this policy does not attempt to deal specifically with legal issues, university members are responsible to act in compliance with the law, including any federal, state and local laws governing computer and telecommunications use, as well as all other applicable university policies.\nPrivileges and Responsibilities\nEvery member of the Carnegie Mellon community who uses computing and related communications systems at Carnegie Mellon, or systems that belong to Carnegie Mellon or which rely on Carnegie Mellon\u2019s infrastructure has the responsibilities described in this policy. This includes members of the Carnegie Mellon community who have restricted privileges, such as alumni who may have electronic mail forwarding access, but no access to \u201clogin\u201d resources. Individuals with personally-owned computers, but who rely upon the university network to connect those computers (either through an on-campus or remote network connection, such as Ethernet, wireless, dialup, DSL) are expected to abide by the policies set forth in this document. Personally-owned computers operating in stand-alone mode or networked through a non-university connection are not covered under this policy, but those users are encouraged to consult the usage policies set forth by their Internet Service Provider.  A fundamental premise of this policy is that anyone sharing computing resources with other individuals should behave as a reasonable, mature and ethical person.\u00a0 The user must recognize that computer systems and networks do not exist in some special rule-free environment; on the contrary, use of computers is a form of communication, and every component of a computing environment and every piece of information it contains belong to the university, the university community as a whole, or some individual or group within that community.  Access to Carnegie Mellon\u2019s computing resources is contingent upon being a member of the university community and adhering to university and Computing Services policies, guidelines and procedures, including this policy.\u00a0 Misuse may result in the loss of access and\/or university disciplinary action. For some users and certain systems, access may be authorized by specific departments, research centers or other organizations affiliated with Carnegie Mellon. In such cases, any department- or group-specific policies and guidelines must be adhered to when using resources provided by the department or group. This is in addition to university policies and Computing Services guidelines and procedures.  Any user who suspects a violation of the University\u2019s computer use policies, or who has knowledge of potential vulnerabilities or security loopholes in a system or network at Carnegie Mellon, should immediately notify the Computer and Network Security Coordinator or abuse@andrew.cmu.edu.\nMaintain the Security and Confidentiality of your Account\nUsers assume personal responsibility for the use made of their computer accounts.\u00a0 This responsibility begins with selecting a secure password, and involves maintaining the confidentiality of that password and changing the password regularly in order to assure the continued security of your account. For guidance in selecting a secure password, see Managing Your Andrew Password.\u00a0 If you believe that someone has made unauthorized use of your account, you should change your password immediately and report the incident to the Computer and Network Security Coordinator or abuse@andrew.cmu.edu.\nRespect for Others\u2019 Property and Privacy Rights\nUsers are responsible to respect copyright agreements and intellectual property ownership. Any material that is the work of another, whether explicitly copyrighted or not, should not be distributed by a user without appropriate acknowledgement and\/or permission of the creator; unless permission has been granted by the owner of copyright protected materials, distribution of copyright protected material via the university network or computer systems is prohibited.\u00a0 So while the university has been granted permission by software vendors to distribute certain software packages via the network, it is not generally permissible for individual users to distribute that same software to others via the university network or computer systems. See the sections in this policy on Misuse and Inappropriate Behavior. While there may be cases in which property rights to particular programs, data, etc., are ambiguous or in dispute, the user must assume that any information not created by himself or herself belongs to someone else and must respect that person\u2019s privacy and property rights to that information.\u00a0 (In certain situations, even information created by the user may not belong to that user but rather to the university or others.) This policy is not intended to limit \u201cfair use\u201d as permitted under the Copyright Act and users having questions about whether a particular use constitutes a \u201cfair use\u201d may consult the General Counsel for advice.\nImproper\/Illegal Communications\u00a0\nAny communications that would be improper or illegal on any other medium are equally so on the computer: libelous material, obscene messages, harassment, forgery, threats, etc. However, this is not intended to restrict the free expression of ideas.\u00a0 Communication conducted in accordance with the university policy on Free Speech and Assembly and Controversial Speakers and with the statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility enunciated in the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University will not be considered a violation of this policy.\u00a0 For further guidelines, see also the university policy on Separation of Individual\u2019s and Institution\u2019s Interests.\nResponsible Sharing of Resources\u00a0\nWhere a resource such as memory, CPU time or access to network resources belongs to the whole community collectively, it must be shared.\nIt is unacceptable to make such excessive use of system or network resources that other users cannot obtain access.\u00a0 Examples include excessive use of CPU time during a period of heavy use on a timesharing system, excessive use of disk space on a system that does not limit such utilization, the use of an excessive amount of network bandwidth in an environment of networked computers, and any activity that makes a system unusable or significantly degrades performance for others.\u00a0 A novice user might be unaware that a particular action constitutes \u201cexcessive use\u201d but, without doubt, once a system administrator makes him or her aware of the fact that such an action is unreasonable, that user will be held responsible for any further such infractions.\u00a0 If you are unsure whether your needs constitute excessive use, contact the system administrator. Similarly, if you need an unusual amount of disk space, CPU time or other resources, check with the system administrator to find out whether this use can be accommodated, rather than risk interfering with the work of others on the system.\nRisks of Data Loss and Data Persistence\u00a0\nAlthough the university will make efforts to secure the network and university controlled servers from abuse and damage, it cannot guarantee against data loss by a student, faculty, member or staff, either on a university-operated or an individually-owned computer.  Users should know that even those files that they have \u201cdeleted\u201d using the appropriate procedures in the application or operating system, may indeed be recoverable if they exist in a system backup file or other persistent form.\u00a0 If the university is asked to recover such data by subpoena, it must cooperate, and data that the user believes to have been destroyed may be recovered in the process.\nPersonal Use\u00a0\nWhile the university makes computer resources available primarily to achieve its goals of education and research, and for administrative activities, it realizes the need to encourage the personal use of computing for the convenience of the campus community. Thus, it is reasonable to allow the use of computing resources for computer mail, document preparation, personal or course Web page publication, or other activity that can facilitate convenience or enhance productivity, to the extent that the activity is within the limits described by Responsible Sharing of Resources.\u00a0 Any personal use of computing resources related to operating a personal business or commercial enterprise is prohibited unless permission to do so has been specifically granted by the provost or the provost\u2019s designee.  We do recognize the difficulty of distinguishing whether certain cases of \u201cpersonal use\u201d are allowable, such as activities that result in personal financial gain (e.g. checking stock prices online), relate to a commercial business (e.g. university-sponsored technology transfer efforts), or support (but do not constitute operating) a personal business (e.g. a student developing a business plan or a faculty member writing a report for a consulting engagement outside the university). In such cases, we rely on individuals to be responsible and judicious in the use of university\u2019s shared computing resources. In particular ensuring:\n\nappropriate use of resources (e.g. any such work is completed outside of university time and does not utilize shared resources such as CPU cycles or network bandwidth to a degree that adversely impacts academic or research activities);\nappropriate use of licenses (e.g. do not use software procured with academic use licenses for commercial applications or development, unless the license explicitly permits such use);\nappropriate marketing (e.g. no creation of \u201c.com\u201d domains within Carnegie Mellon\u2019s \u201cedu\u201d domain, no advertising services and products using Carnegie Mellon email accounts, and no advertising using web pages on Carnegie Mellon servers (any server with a .CMU.EDU host name).\n\n In cases of questionable personal use of resources, you may contact advisor+@andrew.cmu.edu to determine whether a particular activity is permissible.  We reserve the right to restrict personal use of university systems and networks by an individual or by the community at large, if the use of resources for such activities becomes excessive.\u00a0 If you need unlimited access to computer networks for private or business purposes, you can subscribe to a commercial service.  For information regarding the use of resources to produce intellectual property and profit from the development of such property see Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Intellectual Property Policy and the Policy on Conflict of Interest\/Commitment.\nPrivacy\nThe user must presume that the contents of any other users\u2019 directory are private unless expressly designated otherwise, just as one would presume that the contents of someone\u2019s apartment or office are private.\u00a0 The only exceptions to this rule are: that in some environments, files such as \u201cplan files\u201d may be considered public even if the user has not expressly designated them as such; and that some services such as web pages and anonymous or \u201cguest access\u201d ftp services may be considered to be public, but only for those areas not protected by password and which are \u201cobviously\u201d public. An unprotected account or shared device (such as a shared disk on a networked computer) are not considered to be public unless the name or service expressly indicates that it is.\u00a0 In such cases, any files or other data which would appear to be private in nature, by virtue of the file name or data stored, even if \u201cpublicly accessible\u201d should be considered to be private. The user accessing such files has a responsibility to ask the owner of the files or service if the files are intended to be publicly accessible before the user does more than a \u201ccursory glance\u201d sufficient to cause the question.  A user can explicitly grant access to his or her directories, files or to services run from his or her systems. However, users who issue general or vague invitations to browse through their files incur a special obligation to protect any material that they do not wish others to see.\u00a0 Indeed, all users are urged to maintain protection levels on their files consistent with the access they are actually willing to give to other users.\nAccess to Faculty Data \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nElectronic data on a faculty member\u2019s account, whether stored on a computer in the faculty member\u2019s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that faculty member, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the faculty member\u2019s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, or order of a court. Posting of data by a faculty member on servers available to the public or to students shall be understood to imply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the faculty member will likewise imply consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the faculty member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university\u2019s computing infrastructure.  Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \u201cemergency.\u201d Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job position\/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost or by a designate of the Provost.  Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the faculty member whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to compliance therewith, and, whenever possible and legally permissible, sufficient time must be allowed, before intrusion, to allow the faculty member to file a motion to quash. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an emergency cannot be used as evidence in University sanctions of any faculty member, and cannot be released to the public, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or constitute evidence of a crime concealment of which would obstruct justice, and in the latter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any intrusion by an employee of the University into a faculty member\u2019s electronic data must be reported to the faculty member as soon as possible, and within five days of the event in writing both to the faculty member, if possible, and unless prohibited by order of court, and to an Ombudsman, who shall be a member of the regular faculty selected annually by the Nominating Committee of the Faculty Senate and who has been endorsed by majority vote of the Faculty Senate. The Ombudsman shall be a current or retired regular faculty member who holds no administrative appointment and is not a member of the Faculty Review Committee. The Ombudsman shall have authority to investigate whether an intrusion was warranted by the policy and, (i) shall inform the President and the affected faculty member of the Ombudsman\u2019s findings; (ii) where a violation of the policy is found, shall inform the Faculty Review Committee of the policy violation; and (iii) where appropriate, in the absence of the affected faculty member, to bring a grievance before the Faculty Review Committee. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense.  For purposes of this section, the term \u201cfaculty\u201d shall mean any person who is a member of the Faculty Organization as defined in Article III of the Constitution of the Faculty Organization.\nAccess to Staff Data \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nElectronic data on a staff member\u2019s account, whether stored on a computer in the staff member\u2019s office or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that staff member, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the staff member\u2019s consent, except in cases of emergency, in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, order of a court, or by specific request by the staff members\u2019 supervisor for the purpose of accessing work-related electronic data. Posting of data by a staff member on servers available to the public or to members of the university shall be understood to imply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the staff member will likewise imply consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the staff member, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university\u2019s computing infrastructure.  Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \u201cemergency.\u201d\u00a0 Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job position\/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost or by a designate of the Provost.  Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the staff member whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to compliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an emergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or constitute evidence of a crime concealment of which would obstruct justice, and in the latter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any such findings may be reported to the staff member\u2019s supervisor, department head, or to Human Resources for appropriate investigation and action. Any intrusion by an employee of the University into a staff member\u2019s electronic data must be reported to the staff member as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via electronic mail unless prohibited by order of court, or due to a continuance of an ongoing investigation by the University. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense.  When possible, staff members will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or other intrusions into their electronic data. In cases where a staff member believes that electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed by another staff member, the incident should be reported to Human Resources.\nAccess to Student Data \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nElectronic data stored in a student account, whether stored on a computer in the student\u2019s residence or elsewhere under the proprietary control of that student, may not be examined, i.e., the contents of the data read by a person, without the student\u2019s consent, except in cases of emergency or in response to a valid subpoena, search warrant, order of a court, or by order of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. Posting of data by a student on servers available to the public shall be understood to imply consent, and electronic access given to specific parties by the student will likewise imply consent for those parties to access permitted data. Emergencies may include, for example, but are not limited to, the death, incapacity or disappearance of the student, or the search for and examination of files used for apparently malicious activity in an account which endangers the integrity of shared computers, the network, or other aspects of the university\u2019s computing infrastructure.  Only specifically designated individuals are permitted to determine what passes for an \u201cemergency\u201d. Such individuals may be specifically designated, or may be designated by job position\/description. All assignments for individuals or positions will be done by Provost or by a designate of the Provost.  Whenever possible and legally permissible, notification must be given to the student whose data are subject to subpoena, search warrant, or order of court prior to compliance therewith. Information obtained from an examination warranted by an emergency will not be released to the public, or to the university community or to public officials, except as such releases are essential to resolution of the emergency, or constitute evidence of a crime of concealment which would obstruct justice, and in the latter case release may only be to appropriate law enforcement officials. Any findings of potential wrongdoing unrelated to the original intent of the search, must be reported to the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs for appropriate investigation and action. Any intrusion by an employee of the University into a student\u2019s electronic data must be reported to the student as soon as possible, and within five days of the event via electronic mail to the student, if possible, unless prohibited by an order of the court or because of an ongoing investigation conducted by the University. Violation of any aspect of this policy is a sanctionable offense.  When possible, students will be informed about the issuance of court orders, or other intrusions into their electronic data, including the purpose of the search.\u00a0\u00a0 In cases where a student believes that electronic data in their account has been inappropriately accessed by a staff member, the incident should be reported to Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.  Note: Removable media such as floppy disks, zip drives, tapes, or CDs in a faculty or staff office, or in a residence hall are not subject to search by Computing Services, though Computing Services will assist authorized law enforcement agencies or authorities to read data after they are obtained, at the agencies\u2019 or authorities\u2019 request.\nProtecting Confidential Information\u00a0\u00a0\nUsers who maintain confidential information, such as records relating to employees or students, are responsible for following privacy-related policies and laws.\nProtecting Personal Information\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs is described throughout this policy, data transmitted across the university network or stored on university systems may be accessed by others as a result of misuse by an individual, as an incidental result of the routine operation of the network and systems, or in response to a court subpoena or university investigation into suspected or alleged misuse. While complete privacy of personal data may not be possible, users who wish to ensure a higher degree of privacy for their data are encouraged to use encryption, PGP security, or other techniques to reduce the risk that others may access their data.\u00a0 For more information on these techniques, see various newsgroups (e.g. comp.security.pgp) or web references (e.g. comp.security.pgp FAQ).\nMisuse and Inappropriate Behavior\nThe following activities are expressly prohibited at Carnegie Mellon:\n\n\n\nUsing a computer system without proper authorization granted through the University, college, or department management structure. Some activities such as \u201cport scanning\u201d are not expressly prohibited.\u00a0 However, if the target of such scanning requests that an individual or system stop performing such actions, the person or system performing the scans must stop scanning the target machine unless the scans are being carried out by a system administrator who has the authority and responsibility over the machine(s) being scanned or for the network being used.\n\n\nConcealing your identity, or assuming the identity of another (e.g., by sending forged electronic mail).\u00a0 Note that some forms of electronic communication, such as browsing Web pages, passively \u201cidentify\u201d users. Keeping your identity private either by not setting an identity in your browser or by using a Web-anonymizer in order to protect yourself from being put onto mailing lists is not a violation of this policy.\n\n\nSharing your password or account with the specific exception of staff or faculty members allowing their support personnel to access their accounts in order to provide services appropriate to their job functions. Note that some policies for the accessing of specific systems or data (see Data and Computer Security, Confidentiality of Administrative Data) explicitly forbid the sharing of passwords used to access them, and that such restrictions for those specific systems override this policy.\n\n\nUsing another person\u2019s computer account, userID, files, or data without appropriate permission, as described in the previous bullet (e.g. using an account found \u201clogged in\u201d on a cluster machine).\n\n\nDeleting or tampering with another user\u2019s files or with information stored by another user on any information-bearing medium (disk, tape, memory, etc.). Even if the user\u2019s files are unprotected, with the exception of files obviously intended for public reading, such as Web pages, it is improper for another user to read them unless the owner has given permission (e.g. in an announcement in class or on a computer bulletin board).\n\n\nAttempting to \u201ccrack\u201d or guess other users\u2019 passwords. System administrators or those specifically designated by the administrator or owner of a system may attempt to crack passwords in order to test and enhance the security of the system. In cases where an individual or department \u201cowns\u201d machines which use password files controlled by another organization (e.g. Andrew machines or their like), the owner may not attempt to crack passwords without explicit permission by the owners of the password database.\n\n\n\u00a0Obtaining passwords by other means, such as password capturing programs.\n\n\nAttempting to circumvent system security (e.g. breaking into a system or using programs to obtain \u201croot\u201d access), without the explicit permission of the owner of that system.\n\n\n\u00a0Denying appropriate access to resources to other users (e.g. \u201cping flooding\u201d another system, sending \u201cmail bombs,\u201d or modifying a login file in order to cause a user to not be able to log in).\n\n\n\u00a0Releasing programs such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, etc., that disrupt other users, damage software or hardware, disrupt network performance, or replicate themselves for malicious purpose.\n\n\nSending commercial solicitations via electronic mail (i.e. spamming) to individuals, or to newsgroups or mailing lists where such advertising is not part of the purpose of the group or list. (It is permissible to send a commercial solicitation to a \u201cfor sale\u201d newsgroup, provided that the advertisement conforms to other policies and guidelines at Carnegie Mellon.)\n\n\nAny \u201cmass mailing\u201d which is solicitous in nature, unless the mailing is in the conduct of university business.\n\n\nReselling of services based on the university network, such as web hosting, mailing services or the selling of shell accounts.\n\n\nRunning a proxy server which results in inappropriate or unauthorized access to university materials to non-university members.\n\n\nAdvertising commercial businesses or ventures on Web pages hosted by Carnegie Mellon, unless prior authorization has been granted.\n\n\nUsing mail messages to harass or intimidate another person (such as by repeatedly sending unwanted mail or broadcasting unsolicited mail).\n\n\nViolations of any local, state or federal laws, such as the distribution of copyright-protected materials (e.g. the distribution of commercial software, music or films in electronic format without appropriate permissions by the owner, even if the user distributing the materials notifies others of their copyright status).\n\n\nTampering with, willful destruction of or theft of any computer equipment, whether it belongs to the university or to an individual. Tampering includes any deliberate effort to degrade or halt a system, to tie up a system or to compromise the system\/network performance.\u00a0 Willful destruction includes any deliberate disabling or damaging of computer systems, peripheral equipment such as scanners or printers, or other facilities or equipment including the network, and any deliberate destruction or impairment of software or other users\u2019 files or data.\n\n\nThe unauthorized removal of university or another's computing equipment, which constitutes theft.\n\n\n\n\nThis list should not be considered to be complete or exhaustive. It should, however, serve as a set of examples of obviously inappropriate behaviors. If you are in doubt about the appropriateness of something that you want to do, contact the Computing Services Help Center at 8-HELP, or send mail to advisor+@andrew.cmu.edu and ask first.\nEnforcement\nInappropriate behavior in the use of computers is punishable under the general university policies and regulations regarding faculty, students and staff. The offenses mentioned in this policy range from relatively minor to extremely serious, though even a minor offense may be treated severely if it is repeated or malicious. Certain offenses may also be subject to prosecution under federal, state or local laws.  Appropriate disciplinary action depends not only on the nature of the offense, but also on the intent and previous history of the offender. The range of possible penalties includes reprimands, loss of computing privileges, course failures for students, disciplinary probation, suspension or dismissal from the university and\/or criminal prosecution.  Offenses that are minor or appear to be accidental in nature are often handled in a very informal manner such as through electronic mail. More serious offenses will involve formal procedures pursued through the Division of Student Affairs for students, Human Resources and\/or the hiring university department or administrative unit for staff, or the Faculty Review Committee for faculty.\nRestrictions of Privileges During Investigations\nDuring the course of an investigation of alleged inappropriate or unauthorized use, it may be necessary to temporarily suspend a user\u2019s network or computing privileges, but only after determining there is at least a prima facie case against the individual, as well as a risk to the university or it\u2019s computing resources if privileges are not revoked. In these cases, it is important to recognize that the restriction of network or computing privileges is intended to protect the system rather than to punish the individual. For example, if a computer account has been used to launch an attack on another system, that account will be rendered inactive until the investigation is complete. This is a necessary action taken to prevent further misuse and does not presume that the account holder initiated the misuse.\u00a0 Unsubstantiated reports of abuse will not result in the suspension of accounts or network access unless sufficient evidence is provided to show that inappropriate activity occurred. For example, if someone reports that their computer was \u201cattacked\u201d by a Carnegie Mellon system, the burden will be upon the complainant to provide sufficient data logs or other evidence to show that the incident did, indeed at least appear to be an attack.\nAdverse Impact on Shared Systems\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe university reserves the right to discontinue communication with external systems that are known to harbor spammers or account crackers, despite the fact that this may restrict certain acceptable communications. When deemed necessary, this action will be taken to protect the security and safety of our systems. Similarly, there may be cases where a particular service or activity on a given University system will, by the very nature of its legitimate operation, tend to generate attacks from other Internet sites. If these attacks are frequent and severe enough to cause service interruptions for larger parts of the campus community, it may be necessary to temporarily or permanently remove these systems from the campus network. In cases where such an action is deemed necessary, network administrators will work with the maintainers of the system to identify alternative methods of network access. In cases where the university restricts access to external sites or removes network access for internal sites, the purpose of the action is to maintain the security and reliability of the computer systems and networks rather than to punish an individual or a site, or to restrict the free expression of ideas.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the vice provost for research, ext. 412-268-6967. For information on technology transfer contact ext. 8-7393.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATLED POLICY:\nPolicy on Consulting by Faculty\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION:\nIntellectual Property and the Information Infrastructure: The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights [PDF], released by former Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, Chair of the White House Information Infrastructure Task Force.\n\n\nFORMS:\nCarnegie Mellon University Intellectual Property Policy Agreement Form\u00a0[PDF]\n\n\n\n \n1. Purpose\n\nThe policy reflects the following goals:\n\nTo create a university environment that encourages the generation of new knowledge by faculty, staff, and students.\nTo facilitate wide transfer of useful inventions and writings to society.\nTo motivate the development and dissemination of intellectual property by providing appropriate financial rewards to creators and the university, and administrative assistance to creators.\nTo ensure that the financial return from the development of intellectual property does not distort decisions and operations of the university in a manner contrary to the mission of the university.\n\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating the university to society:\n\nThe mission of the university remains the generation and dissemination of knowledge.\nIntellectual property will be generated within the university, and there exists an obligation to disseminate it. An interface is needed if better technology transfer is to be achieved, and the university will provide mechanisms for that function.[1]\n\nThe policy is based upon the following principles relating faculty, staff and students to the university.\n\nIntellectual property is created by individuals, or by groups of individuals, who are entitled to choose the course of disclosure; academic freedom of individuals is a higher priority than possible financial rewards.\nThere exists an historical tradition allowing authors to retain ownership of intellectual property rights from textbooks and works of art.\nThe university is the support of the whole campus community, and is thereby entitled to share in financial rewards.\nThere should be incentives for all parties to pursue financial rewards together, consistent with the expressed goals of the policy. The distribution of these rewards should reflect, insofar as possible, the creative contributions of the creator, and the resources contributed by and risks assumed by both the creator and the university in developing intellectual property.\nSince it is frequently difficult to meaningfully assess risks, resources and potential rewards, negotiated agreements are to be encouraged whenever possible.\n\nFootnote:\n[1]This document presumes the existence of a university office to facilitate technology transfer. Such an office would serve as a clearinghouse for contacts with outside partners, would perform patent and copyright tasks, and would develop an effective marketing capability.\n\u00a0\n\n2. Definitions\n\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section. These definitions do not necessarily conform to customary usage.\nIntellectual Property includes any patentable invention, any copyrightable subject matter, or trade secret. It also includes works of art, and inventions or creations that might normally be developed on a proprietary basis.\nUniversity means Carnegie Mellon.\nStudent means any full-time or part-time graduate or undergraduate student, regardless of whether the student receives financial aid from the university or from outside sources. It is the responsibility of students who are also employees of other outside entities to resolve any conflicts between this policy and provisions of agreements with their employers prior to beginning any undertaking at the university that will involve the development of intellectual property.\nFaculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the Faculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first year), and part-time faculty.\nStaff means any employee of the university other than students and faculty as defined above. If a student is also a part-time university employee, he is considered as staff with regard to intellectual property developed as a result of his employment, and as a student with regard to other intellectual property. A full-time non-faculty employee who is also taking one or more courses is considered to be staff. Visitors to the university who make substantial use of university resources are considered as staff with respect to any intellectual property arising from such use. (The distinction between faculty and staff does not affect intellectual property rights except for representation on the Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee [see Section 5]).\nCreator means any person or persons who create an item of intellectual property.\nNet proceeds to the university means all proceeds received by the university on intellectual property that it assigns, sells or licenses, minus any application, litigation, interference, or marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being licensed. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; the sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed.\nNet proceeds to the creator means all proceeds received by the creator from intellectual property owned by him that he sells, assigns or licenses, less the costs of application, legal protection, or litigation, interference, travel and other marketing costs directly attributable to the intellectual property being exploited. Such net proceeds do not include compensation legitimately received by the creator for consulting services or interest or other return on invested labor or capital. Deducted costs shall be reasonable and fair, and shall be properly disclosed; the sources and amounts of compensation shall also be properly disclosed.\nSubstantial use of university facilities means extensive unreimbursed use of major university laboratory, studio or computational facilities, or human resources. The use of these facilities must be important to the creation of the intellectual property; merely incidental use of a facility does not constitute substantial use, nor does extensive use of a facility commonly available to all faculty or professional staff (such as libraries and offices), nor does extensive use of a specialized facility for routine tasks. Use will be considered \"extensive\" and facilities will be considered \"major\" if similar use of similar facilities would cost the creator more than $5000 (five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollars if purchased or leased in the public market. Creators wishing to directly reimburse the university for the use of its facilities must make arrangements to do so before the level of facilities usage for a particular intellectual property becomes substantial. (This provision is not intended to override any other department or university policy concerning reimbursement for facilities usage.)\nIn General:\nIn any given year the equivalent figure for a particular amount of money in constant 1984 dollars will be obtained by multiplying that amount of money by the ratio of the most recent quarterly Disposable Personal Income Deflator divided by the average monthly Disposable Personal Income Deflator for the year 1984.\nAs used in this policy, the masculine gender includes the feminine gender, singular or plural, wherever appropriate.\n\n3. Policy Provisions\n\nThis section states the policies concerning ownership of intellectual property created at the university. In order of precedence, ownership of intellectual property shall be as follows:\n3-1. Externally Sponsored Work\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created as a result of work conducted under an agreement between an external sponsor and the university that specifies the ownership of such intellectual property shall be owned as specified in said agreement. If the university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself to be the owner of the intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below.\nProcedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the university to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by an externally sponsored contract of the intellectual property provisions of that contract in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to be in writing and the university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions by any person working on externally sponsored projects. A summary of external sponsorship agreements limiting the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general university community.\nIf the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed on his intellectual property rights by external sponsorship agreements, the creator is entitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university resulting from his intellectual property.\n3-2. Internally Sponsored Work\nOwnership Provisions: When the university provides funds or facilities for a particular project to the extent of substantial use, it may also choose to designate itself as sponsor of that work. The university may declare itself the owner of intellectual property resulting from said work. In such cases the university must specify in advance the disposition of any intellectual property rights arising from the project. If the university declares itself to be a sponsor, but does not declare itself the owner of the intellectual property, ownership shall be determined in accordance with 3-6-4 below.\nProcedural Provisions: It is the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research of the university to inform each person whose intellectual property rights are limited by internally sponsored work of the intellectual property ownership rights specified by the university as to that work in advance of the beginning of work thereon. Such notice is to be in writing and the university may require written acknowledgment of such provisions by any person working on internally sponsored projects. A summary of work for which university sponsorship limits the intellectual property rights of potential creators will be maintained by the Office of Sponsored Research and will be available to the general university community.\nIf the university fails to notify a creator, effectively and in advance, of limitations imposed on his intellectual property rights by internal university sponsorship, the creator is entitled to receive from the university 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university resulting from his intellectual property.\n3-3. Individual Agreements\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property which is the subject of a specific agreement between the university and the creator(s) thereof shall be owned as provided in said agreement. Such agreements by the university and the faculty are encouraged.\nProcedural Provisions: Except where limited by external sponsorship agreements, creators and the university may negotiate individual agreements to govern ownership of intellectual property regardless of the applicability of any other provision hereof.\n3-4. Intellectual Property Created Within Scope of Employment\nOwnership Provisions: Intellectual property created by university employees who were employed specifically to produce a particular intellectual property shall be owned by the university if said intellectual property was created within the normal scope of their employment. Faculty are presumed not to be hired to produce a particular intellectual property. On the other hand, computer programs written on the job by staff computer programmers would fall under this provision.\n3-5. Public Dedication\nOwnership Provisions: Except when limited by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3 or 3-4 above, the creator of any intellectual property may choose to place his or her creation in the public domain. In such cases both the creator and the university waive all ownership rights to said property.\nProcedural Provisions: Creators wishing to place their intellectual property in the public domain are responsible for ascertaining that the right to public dedication of that intellectual property is not limited by any external agreement, university sponsorship arrangement or terms of employment as described in Provisions 3-1, 3-2 or 3-3 above. The university provost will provide such a determination in writing upon request by the creator. It is also the creator's responsibility to ensure that disclosure does not include valuable intellectual property owned by others. (This provision does not release the university from its general obligation to notify creators of limitations to intellectual property rights specified in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2 above.)\nTo facilitate the actual transfer of knowledge of the intellectual property to the public at large, the creator shall provide the university with a complete description and documentation of the property placed in the public domain, specifically including a copy of the property in the case of printed material, and complete machine-readable source code in the case of software. All such material provided to the university will be placed in the University Library and made available to the public at large. The university will take appropriate action on a regular basis to publicize summary descriptions of intellectual property recently placed in the public domain. The university will also provide any member of the general public copies of such material on a cost-recovery basis.\nThe provisions of this section do not apply to the normal scholarly or creative publication processes unless the creator intends to waive all proprietary rights to the publication.\n3-6. In General\nUnless governed by subparts 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 or 3-5 above, ownership of intellectual property created at the university shall be determined as follows:\n3-6-1. Traditional Rights Retained\nOwnership Provisions: In keeping with academic traditions at the university, the creator retains all rights to the following types of intellectual property, without limitation: books (including textbooks), educational courseware, articles, non-fiction, novels, poems, musical works, dramatic works including any accompanying music, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, motion pictures and other similar audio-visual works, and sound recordings, regardless of the level of use of university facilities. This provision does not include computer software (other than educational courseware) or data bases.\nProcedural Provisions: The types of intellectual property listed in the preceding paragraph share the attribute that they display information or visual or auditory appearances which are fully revealed to the purchaser or consumer. Thus, for example, source code listings would also be considered within this category. On the other hand, most computer software and data bases do not share this attribute; they are characterized by their capacity to perform tasks. Because of their utilitarian nature, ownership rights with respect thereto are governed by 3-6-3 or 3-6-4. Educational courseware is included in this provision in all cases because of its role in furthering the primary educational mission of the university.\nThis provision applies regardless of any university sponsorship of the work, and it may be modified only by a specific prior agreement between the creator and the university. The use of university-owned computers and other facilities in the preparation of books and similar works does not alter this provision, though other university policies may limit such use or require reimbursement to the university. Similarly, the use of externally sponsored resources does not alter this provision, unless the creator is effectively notified in advance of such limitations to his rights in accordance with 3-1.\n3-6-2. No Substantial Use of University Facilities\nOwnership Provisions: The creator owns all intellectual property created without substantial use of university facilities, including intellectual property rights in computer software and data bases.\n3-6-3. Substantial Use of University Facilities - No External or Internal Sponsorship\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities, but not directly arising from externally sponsored work, or from work for which the university has declared itself as sponsor, shall be determined as set forth hereinafter depending on whether the creator or the university develops said property.\n3-6-3-1. Development by Creator\nOwnership Provisions: The creator originally owns intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities but no external or internal sponsorship, and retains said ownership by commercial development of said property subject to the following: (i) the university shall receive 15% (fifteen percent) of the net proceeds to the creator above $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars) in constant 1984 dollars from all sources (in the case of patents and copyrights, this provision shall be limited to the life of the patent or copyright), and (ii) the university shall receive a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, royalty free license to use said intellectual property. In the case of software, this license includes access by specified university personnel to the source listings, and the university shall require each person to whom a disclosure is made to execute in advance a binding confidentiality agreement in favor of and enforceable by the creator. If the intellectual property is created solely by a student or students, the creator is exempt from the obligation to pay to the university a fraction of his net proceeds, but not from the provision of this paragraph for a non-exclusive license to the university.\nProcedural Provisions: If the creator develops an intellectual property that is covered by this provision, he must make full and fair disclosure to the university of all such sources of compensation relating to that intellectual property.\n3-6-3-2. Development by the University\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of university facilities, but not directly arising from sponsored research, the creator will originally retain the rights to the property, provided that he desires to commercially develop the property himself or to make it available to the public. If, however, the creator elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in pursuing such development, then the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the university. Intellectual property acquired by the university in this fashion will be treated as in 3-6-4-1 below.\nProcedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the university's provost as required under Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the university may request that the creator decide whether he will develop the intellectual property or will grant the rights to the university, and execute documents to pass on the title. Such a decision must be made within one year of the request or the creator will automatically lose his rights in favor of the university.\n3-6-4. Substantial Use of University Facilities - External or Internal Sponsorship\nOwnership of intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities and directly arising from work sponsored under an agreement between an external sponsor and the university, or from work for which the university has declared itself a sponsor, but for which neither the external sponsor nor the university have specified the ownership of resulting intellectual property shall be determined as set forth hereinafter depending on whether the creator or the university develops said property.\n3-6-4-1. Development by University\nOwnership Provisions: The university originally owns intellectual property created with substantial use of university facilities provided by an external agreement or internal university sponsorship and retains said ownership by commercial development of said property, subject to the following: in all cases, the creator shall receive 50% (fifty percent) of the net proceeds to the university.\nProcedural Provisions: When an intellectual property is created with substanial use of university resources provided by an external research contract or a specific university sponsorship agreement, and when that contract or agreement either does not specify the disposition of the intellectual property rights arising from that sponsorship, or it permits the university and\/or creator to retain or acquire such intellectual property rights, the university will originally retain the rights to such intellectual property.\n3-6-4-2. Development by Creator\nOwnership Provisions: When intellectual property is created with substantial use of university facilities provided by external or internal sponsorship, the university will originally retain the rights to the property, provided that it desires to commercially develop the property or to make it available to the public. If, however, the university elects not to commercially develop same or fails to show diligence in such development, the ownership rights to that property may be acquired by the creator. Intellectual property acquired by the creator in this fashion will be treated as in 3-6-3-1 above. This assignment of rights to the creator may be prohibited by the terms of an external sponsorship agreement with the university or by an internal university sponsorship declaration, but in such cases the creator must be notified in advance, as in Provisions 3-1 and 3-2.\nProcedural Provisions: At the time the intellectual property is disclosed to the university's provost as required by Section 4-1, or at any time thereafter, the creator may request that the university decide whether it will commercially develop the intellectual property or execute an assignment of the intellectual property rights to the creator. Such a decision must be made within 120 (one hundred twenty) days of the request or the university automatically waives its rights in favor of the creator, and it must execute an assignment of these rights to the creator.\n3-6-5. Consulting Agreements\nOwnership Provisions: Work done by individuals as consultants to outside firms is presumed not to involve unreimbursed substantial use of university facilities, and the rights to intellectual property created under consulting agreements are retained by the outside firms or the individual as specified by the terms of the consulting agreement and the terms of Provision 3-6-2 above.\nProcedural Provisions: Under university policy consulting work must not make substantial unreimbursed use of university facilities except by explicit prior agreement. Any member of the university community who is engaged in consulting work or in business is responsible for ensuring that provisions in his agreements are not in conflict with this policy of the university or with the university's commitments. The university's Innovation Transfer Office will, upon request, provide assistance in this respect. The university's rights and the individual's obligations to the university are in no way abrogated or limited by the terms of such agreements. Each creator of intellectual property should make his obligations to the university clear to those with whom he makes such agreements and should ensure that they are provided with a current statement of the university's intellectual property policy. Appropriate sample contract wording to cover various possible external consulting arrangements shall be available from the university provost.\n\n4. General Procedures\n\n4-1.\nThe creator of any intellectual property that is or might be owned by the university under this policy is required to make reasonably prompt written disclosure of the work to the university's provost, and to execute any document deemed necessary to perfect legal rights in the university and enable the university to file patent applications and applications for copyright registration when appropriate. This disclosure to the provost should be made at the time when legal protection for the creation is contemplated, and it must be made before the intellectual property is sold, used for profit, or disclosed to the public. Whenever legal protection for intellectual property is anticipated all persons engaged in such creative activity are encouraged to keep regular notebooks and records.\n4-2.\nWhenever the university undertakes commercial development it shall do so, if possible, in a fashion that provides for the widest possible dissemination, avoiding suppression of inventions from which the public might otherwise benefit, providing for non-exclusive licensing at reasonable royalties, and giving consideration to more favorable or royalty-free licensing to non-profit charitable institutions, minority businesses or enterprises in developing countries.\n4-3.\nThe university's share of any proceeds under this policy will be used to reimburse the university for its expenses for commercial development of intellectual property. Any additional return to the university will be used to further the academic purposes of all the disciplines of the entire university.\n\n5. Resolution of Disputes\n\nThis policy constitutes an understanding which is binding on the university and on the faculty, staff, and students upon whom it is effective according to the terms of Section 6 below, as a condition for participating in research programs at the university or for the use of university funds or facilities.\nAny question of interpretation or claim arising out of or relating to this policy, or dispute as to ownership rights of intellectual property under this policy, will be settled by the following procedure:\n\nThe issue must first be submitted to the university's Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee in the form of a letter setting forth the grievance or issue to be resolved. The committee will review the matter and then advise the parties of its decision within 60 days of submission of the letter.\nIf any of the parties to the dispute is not satisfied with the committee's decision, the party may seek binding arbitration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) will give some weight to the decision of the Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee in reaching a decision. The losing party of the arbitration hearing will pay for all costs of the arbitration unless the arbitrator(s) specifies otherwise.\n\nThe Intellectual Property Adjudication Committee will consist of a chair who is a member of the tenured faculty, four other members of the faculty, and four other members representing, respectively, the university administration, the technical staff, and the graduate and undergraduate student bodies. Initially, half of the members of the committee (including the chair) will be appointed for two-year terms of office, and the remaining half will be appointed for a one-year term. After one year new members of the committee will be appointed for two-year terms of office. The chair will be appointed by the chair of the Faculty Senate, with the advice and consent of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee, and the remaining eight members of the committee will be appointed by the president of the university or his designee. At all times at least one of the faculty members will have had significant practical experience with intellectual property development and exploitation. The faculty members appointed by the president of the university will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by the Faculty Senate or its designated committee and nominees with experience in intellectual property development will be identified as such by the Faculty Senate. The staff representative will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by Staff Council, and the administration representative will be named directly by the president of the university or his designee. The graduate student representative will be selected from a list of nominees prepared by the Graduate Student Organization. The undergraduate representative will be chosen from a list of nominees prepared by the Student Senate. The committee will use the guidelines set forth in this policy to decide upon a fair resolution of any dispute.\nIf possible, the committee will also provide on request informal advisory opinions to creators and the university indicating how it is likely to interpret the provisions of this policy as it applies to special cases.\n\n6. Effective Date of Policy\n\nThis policy will become effective August 27, 1985. Once effective this policy will be binding on new faculty, administration, and staff when hired, and on graduate and undergraduate students when admitted. Current faculty and staff will also become bound by this policy when they sign new employment contracts as the result of the renewal of limited-term appointments or promotion. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and current staff and students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and pending intellectual property by voluntary written consent. Unless the creator and the university agree to a different arrangement, intellectual property that is already partially developed at the time this policy becomes effective will be treated according to the provisions of the patent policy by which the creator is currently bound. Similarly, members of the university working under contracts signed before the effective date of this policy who do not choose to accept this policy will remain bound by the patent policies that already apply to them. With respect to intellectual property developed during the course of employment at the university, this policy shall continue to be binding on any person whose relationship with the university becomes terminated. The university should take all administrative steps necessary to ensure that employees and students sign, upon initial employment, registration or at other appropriate times, forms that indicate their acceptance of this policy.\n\n7. Amendments of the Policy\n\nAmendments of this policy may be proposed by the Faculty Senate, Staff Council or university administration. Proposed amendments must be approved by a two-thirds majority of votes in the Faculty Senate and subsequently approved by a simple majority of votes cast in a referendum administered by the Faculty Senate that is open to all members of the faculty as defined by this policy and to the exempt staff, provided that this majority constitutes at least 25% (twenty-five percent) of those eligible to vote. This referendum must be preceded by an opportunity for public discussion open to all interested faculty, administration, staff and students. Amendments that are supported by the faculty and staff must then be approved by the president of the university and adopted by the university trustees. Once adopted, amendments will become binding on new faculty, administration, and staff when hired, on existing faculty and staff when they sign new employment contracts, and on graduate and undergraduate students when admitted. Other university personnel, including tenured faculty, and current staff and students may choose to become bound by this policy for future and pending intellectual property by voluntary written consent. Intellectual property that is already developed or under development at the time that an amendment to the policy is ratified will not be bound by the terms of the amendment without the voluntary written consent of both the creator and the university.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise with respect to these investment processes. The purpose of this Investment Committee Conflict of Interest Policy Statement is to provide procedures for dealing with such conflicts.\u00a0 The philosophy behind the procedures is to promote disclosure and transparency, rather than to impose categorical prohibitions, and to provide for a flexible approach to deal with actual or perceived conflicts.\nPolicies with Respect to Investment Funds Involving Members of the CMU Board of Trustees:\u00a0\n\nIt is presumed that CMU will not invest in any hedge fund, private equity fund, venture capital fund, limited partnership, mutual fund, or other similar entity (\u201cInvestment Fund\u201d) of which a member of the CMU Board of Trustees is the general or managing partner, director, manager, a management-level employee, majority owner, or sponsor.\u00a0 CMU may invest in such an Investment Fund if approved by the Investment Committee (\u201cIC\u201d) and the Chair of the CMU Board of Trustees.\u00a0 In the event that the Chair of the CMU Board of Trustees has a conflict, a potential conflict or is otherwise unavailable, a Vice Chair of the CMU Board of Trustee\u2019s may serve as substitute, providing he\/she also has no conflict or potential conflict.\n\nPolicies with Respect to Members:\n\nA Member must disclose to the IC Chair any employment or financial interest that the Member or a person in the Member\u2019s household has in an investment or other transaction being considered by the Investment Committee.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid doubt, the following relationships do not require disclosure: (1) small ownership interests\u00a0 (defined as less than 5%) in investment management companies whose investment services and products are being considered by the program; (2) professional and business relationships with investment management companies unless the Member owns more than five percent (5%) of the entity providing services to, or having a relationship with, such investment management company, or provides such services personally; and (3)\u00a0 any portfolio position of other investment entities, where the member is serving as a fiduciary or employee, provided, however, that a Member must disclose an investment or transaction as a fiduciary or employee if (a) such investment or transaction would be impacted by CMU\u2019s investment or transaction or (b) CMU\u2019s investment or transaction would be impacted by the other entity\u2019s investment or transaction. \u00a0\n\n\nA Member must recuse himself\/herself from the vote and discussion on any matter with respect to an entity in which the Member or a person in the Member\u2019s household has an employment or financial interest; however, a Member may respond to any questions of the IC prior to recusal.\u00a0 Any such matter may only be approved upon a finding, by the disinterested Members that the investment or other transaction is in CMU\u2019s best interest and is fair and reasonable to CMU.\u00a0 To avoid doubt, the following relationships do not require recusal: (1) small ownership interests (defined as less than 5%) in investment management companies whose investment services and products are being considered by the program; (2) professional and business relationships with investment management companies unless the Member owns more than five percent (5%) of the entity providing services to, or having a relationship with, such investment management company, or provides such services personally; and (3) roles serving as fiduciaries or employees of other investment entities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nIt is presumed that CMU will not invest in any Investment Fund of which a Member is the general or managing partner, director, manager, a management-level employee, majority owner, or sponsor.\u00a0 CMU may invest in such an Investment Fund if a 5-person special committee, consisting of three disinterested Members appointed by the Chair of the IC as well as the Chairs of the IC and the Board of Trustees, determines that the investment is in CMU\u2019s best interest and is fair and reasonable to CMU.\n\n\nA Member must disclose to the IC Chair an intent by the Member or a person in the Member\u2019s household to invest in any investment opportunity learned about through such Member\u2019s position on the IC, except for investment opportunities in publicly traded securities purchased on an established market, including mutual funds.\u00a0 No Member or person in a Member\u2019s household may invest in an investment opportunity learned about through such Member\u2019s position on the IC, if the investment would adversely affect CMU\u2019s opportunity.\u00a0 This provision also applies to Members serving as fiduciaries or employees of other investment entities.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nTo facilitate the monitoring of this Policy, annually, each Member shall, on the form or form similar to the one attached, disclose to the Chair of the IC and the Chief Investment Officer his or her employment interests and business relationships beyond being a passive investor, which may give rise to, a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest in the context of the Member\u2019s service on the IC on behalf of the University.\u00a0 If there are material changes in those interests and relationships during the year, the Member shall promptly amend his or her disclosure for the purpose of disclosing those materials.\u00a0 The Chair of the IC will be responsible for reviewing the disclosure forms.\u00a0 The individual disclosure statements shall be held by the Secretary to the Board of Trustees as confidential to the extent permitted by law, but shall be available for review by Members, the University President, the University\u2019s General Counsel, the University\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, and the University\u2019s Board of Trustees Executive Committee members.\n\nPolicies with Respect to Staff:\n\nA Staff member must disclose to the IC any employment or financial interest that the Staff member or a person in the Staff member\u2019s household has in an investment or other transaction being considered by the Investment Office.\u00a0 Any such investment or other transaction must be approved by the IC. To avoid doubt, the following relationships do not require disclosure: (1) small ownership interests (defined as less than 5%) in investment management companies whose investment services and products are being considered by the program; (2) professional and business relationships with investment management companies unless the Member owns more than five percent (5%) of the entity providing services to, or having a relationship with, such investment management company, or provides such services personally; and (3) roles serving as fiduciaries of other investment entities. \u00a0\n\n\nA Staff member must disclose to the IC an intent by the Staff member or a person in the Staff member\u2019s household to invest in any investment opportunity learned about through such Staff member\u2019s position in the Investment Office, except for investment opportunities in publicly traded securities purchased on an established market, including mutual funds.\u00a0 No Staff member or person in a Staff member\u2019s household may invest in an investment opportunity learned about through such Staff member\u2019s position in the Investment Office, if the investment would adversely affect CMU\u2019s opportunity. \u00a0\n\n\nA Staff member may not accept benefits, favors, gifts, or other items of value that are reasonably likely to affect the exercise of such person\u2019s judgment on behalf of CMU, impair confidence in CMU, or create the appearance of impropriety.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Staff is encouraged to interact with entities in which CMU is considering an investment and may accept reimbursed travel costs and de minimis benefits from such entities in the normal course of business that are of the kind customary in the industry. \u00a0\n\n\nA Staff member who chooses to make a private investment in a company, fund, or other similar opportunity where a Member of the University\u2019s Board of Trustees or an IC Member serves as an executive officer, partner or other similar role, must disclose the proposed investment to the Chair of the University Board of Trustees, the University President and the Secretary of the Board of Trustees, who will maintain a record of such investment.\u00a0 In the event that the majority of the Chair of the University\u2019s Board of Trustees, the University President, and the Secretary of the Board decide there is a conflict of interest, the Staff Member will be notified and will not be permitted to make the investment creating the conflict.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPolicies with Respect to Members and Staff:\n\nWhenever the IC holds a meeting at which an interest or investment is disclosed, a Member is recused, a special committee is constituted, or an investment or transaction with respect to which a Member or a Staff member has a conflict of interest is considered, the IC\u2019s consideration of such issues will be reflected in the minutes of the meeting.\n\n\nNo Policy can specifically address every conceivable situation that may entail a conflict or potential of interest.\u00a0 As a general matter, Members and Staff should avoid any actions or situations that might result in or create the appearance of using their association with CMU for private gain, according unwarranted preferential treatment to any individual or organization, losing impartiality, or adversely affecting CMU\u2019s reputation.\u00a0 Further, the Chair of the IC may appoint a special committee, consisting of three disinterested Members, to address any actual or perceived conflict of interest that is not specifically addressed in this Policy.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Charitable Contribution\/Gift: As stated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a donation or gift to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. The gift is voluntary and is made without receiving, or expecting to receive, anything of equal value. Note: Carnegie Mellon University is qualified as a charitable organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS Code. Reinvestment: An endowed fund status whereby all of the fund's income is reinvested in the fund's corpus. Distribution: An endowed fund status whereby a portion of the fund's income is distributed for spending, in accordance with the university's endowed-fund spending practices and policies as they are adopted and revised from time to time by the university's Board of Trustees.\n\n\nForms \/ Instructions\nn\/a\n\n\nRelated Information\nGift Acceptance, Counting, and Reporting PolicyPublic Art Policy\n\n\nReason for Policy \/ Purpose\n\nThe Naming Gifts Policy helps ensure that gifts with associated naming rights are managed in a consistent manner, and according to established university guidelines. It is also designed to provide donors with equitable, consistent, and appropriate recognition and stewardship for their generous support, leading to lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with the university. This Policy applies to all naming gifts secured by the university, not just those managed by University Advancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nApplicability\nThis Policy applies to gifts with associated naming opportunities at the university as a form of recognition for the contributions of individuals or organizations to the university.\n\nTypes of Funds with Potential Naming Opportunities\nEndowed: Endowed funds are designed to provide perpetual support to a designated area. To establish a named endowed fund, a gift must meet the funding minimum set by the Board of Trustees. For current university named endowed fund minimums, contact the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement.\nNon-endowed: In certain circumstances, current-use commitments can qualify for a naming opportunity. Many gifts to name physical entities are in this category.\n\nNote: The University generally will not approve non-endowed named professorships, whether supported by a gift or by institutional funds. University officials seeking to establish a non-endowed named professorship should contact the Office of the Provost.\n\nStandard Designations for Naming Gifts\nPhysical Entity:\nBuildings and other major facilities, discrete components of buildings (wings, lecture halls, auditoriums, foyers, classrooms, laboratories, studios, offices, conference rooms, etc.), athletic facilities, and residence halls.\nCampus grounds, outdoor renovations, gardens, trees, fountains, benches, walkways, parking facilities, and other real property.\nLibraries, or parts of libraries, and other collections of significant size and continuing educational, scientific, historic, artistic, or cultural value.\n\nNon-Physical Entity:\nColleges, schools, departments, institutes, centers, programs, teaching awards, and prizes.\nAcademic or non-academic positions, including but not limited to deanships, professorships, directorships, and lectureships.\nStudent support, including but not limited to scholarships, fellowships, and other student awards.\n\n\nGeneral Terms\nNaming of a university asset or entity must be made in accordance with this Policy and related procedures, and meet all terms of the university's Gift Acceptance, Counting, and Reporting Policy.\nThe donor may select the name of the entity being funded, so long as the criteria set forth in this Policy are met, and university approval is granted. Factors that may be considered by the university in determining the appropriateness of a name include:\nConsistency with the mission, vision, reputation, and values of the university.\nWhether a name may imply the university's endorsement of a political or ideological position or the use of a particular product or service.\nPotential conflict of interest (primarily in cases of corporate or organizational naming gifts).\nWhether the name reinforces the university's branding standards.\nPotential conflict with existing named entities or spaces.\n\nNaming gifts do not confer the right to the donor to determine the use of the fund (e.g., the purpose or use of the named space, specific beneficiary of a student or faculty support fund, program curricula, and\/or research outcomes).\nA named entity may not be announced by any university unit prior to final approval as required by this Policy.\n\nNaming Gift Values\nEndowed Funds:\nThe Board of Trustees establishes the minimum gift amount required to create each type of named endowed fund. Such minimums are important to ensure the endowed fund provides sufficient funds to accomplish the purpose intended by the donor.\nMinimum gift amounts for named endowed funds will be amended by the Board of Trustees from time to time, to correspond with real costs.\nIn some cases, the name of an endowed fund may be different from the name used publicly for the entity the fund supports. In such instances, both the name of the fund and the name to be used publicly will be detailed in the associated gift agreement.\nFor current university named endowed fund minimums, contact the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement.\n\nCurrent-use Funds:\nIn general, named current-use funds adhere to the same fund minimums required to create named endowed funds. Exceptions to this standard are rare, and are only granted by the Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with the President as needed.\nIn some cases, the name of a current-use fund may be different from the name used publicly for the entity the fund supports. In such instances, both the name of the fund and the name to be used publicly will be detailed in the associated gift agreement.\n\nPhysical Entities:\nOnce a new building, expansion, or renovation has been approved by the university, the value of associated naming gifts will be determined by University Advancement, in consultation with the President. This applies to spaces both within and outside buildings.\nSimilarly, the value of associated naming gifts for existing university spaces will be determined by University Advancement, in consultation with the President.\n\n\nDistributions from Endowed Funds Created through Gifts\nTypically, an endowed fund will remain in reinvestment status until the fund reaches the university\u2019s required endowed fund minimum for an endowment of that specific type, unless the donor agreement stipulates the fund should remain in reinvestment until a minimum greater than the university\u2019s required endowed fund minimum is reached. Accumulated earnings and fund additions designated by the university, such as reinvested income, do not count toward meeting the required endowed fund minimum (i.e., only gifts count toward meeting the endowed fund minimum).\nThis provision notwithstanding, the university leader responsible for administering such an endowed fund (e.g., president, provost, dean, vice president, or the designee of that leader) may request to convert the endowed fund to distribution status when the endowment reaches the minimum amount required by the university to establish an endowed fund, as adopted and revised from time to time by the university's Board of Trustees, or when the university has received one-fourth of the value of the gift that established the endowed fund, whichever is greater.\nA request for early conversion of an endowed fund from reinvestment to distribution should be submitted to the Vice President for University Advancement (UA), or his\/her designee, who will confirm that the request is not inconsistent with any gift agreements pertaining to the fund. UA Donor Relations will then work with the university\u2019s Finance division to convert the endowed fund to distribution status.\nA request for early conversion of an endowed fund from reinvestment to distribution that does not meet the threshold set in paragraph VI. b. above may be submitted to the Vice President for University Advancement, who will, in consultation with the Provost and Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer, determine whether to grant the request.\n\nNaming Approval and Timing of Naming Activation\nThe Vice President for University Advancement manages the naming approval process, in consultation with the President and Board of Trustees, as appropriate. (Note:\u00a0 Requests for non-gift-related honorific namings at the university must be directed to the Office of the Provost.)\nName approval may not be granted until the proposed name is known. If the donor does not wish to select the name to be applied when the gift is made, the university may accept the gift, with the name determined later, subject to the terms of approval outlined in this Policy.\nFor binding, irrevocable gifts, a name may go into effect before the gift is paid in full, at the discretion of the Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with necessary university parties.\nFor non-binding, revocable gifts, a name will not be activated until the gift is received.\n\nDonor Recognition\nThe university places great value on recognizing and showing appreciation to donors for their generosity. Therefore, in addition to providing naming rights for eligible gifts, other methods of recognition may be applied, such as those outlined below. It is highly important that recognition be equitable and consistent based on gift type, amount, and designation, and that it adhere to established university standards.\nPhysical Recognition:\nGifts to name a physical entity or college, school, department, center, or institute will typically be recognized via signage, plaques, displays, or other physical installations.\nThe nature and attributes of the physical recognition will be: commensurate to the level and type of gift; designed in accordance with university standards; and aligned with the features of the intended placement location.\nCorporate or organization logos may not be incorporated into recognition signage without approval of the Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with the President.\nPhysical donor recognition items must be approved by the donor and appropriate university representatives prior to production and installation, and may not be installed until the terms outlined in this Policy have been met.\n\nOther Recognition:\nNaming gift donors may also be recognized via other means (e.g., events and media announcements), corresponding with the type, amount, and purpose of the gift.\nIf any works of art are associated with the gift or donor recognition, the Public Art Policy must be followed.\n\n\nDuration of Naming\nNaming is generally granted for the useful life of the entity unless otherwise specified in the gift agreement (and subject to the terms of revocation as set forth in this Policy).\nFor current-use gifts, naming terms, including duration, shall be set forth in writing by the university and donor.\nIf circumstances change so that the purpose for which the named entity was established is or needs to be significantly altered, is no longer needed\/ceases to exist, or if a physical entity is replaced, significantly renovated or no longer habitable, the university will consult with the donor if possible, or the donor's estate, if practicable, to determine an appropriate way to recognize the original naming gift.\n\nRevocation of Naming\nThe university may revoke a naming if any of the following conditions occurs:\nThe pledge obligation is unfulfilled and\/or written off (if partial funding was received that is sufficient for an alternative naming opportunity, the terms of this Policy shall govern any renegotiation for a suitable naming).\nThe university determines that its association with the donor will materially damage the reputation of the university.\nA change in family or organizational circumstances causes the donor or other affected individual(s)\/organization(s) to request a name change or revocation.\n\nRevocation decisions shall be made by the President based on the recommendation of the Vice President for University Advancement. The President will determine whether the Board of Trustees should be consulted.\nThe university shall make all reasonable efforts to inform the original donor or the donor's heirs\/designees in advance of any revocation or change.\n\nSpecial Circumstances and Exceptions\nAny special circumstances or requests for exceptions must be referred to the Vice President for University Advancement, who will determine the course of action, which may include consultation with the President.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

The university believes that the job performance of each individual employee influences the quality of the institution as a whole. The university recognizes that job performance may be affected by personal problems that, when addressed in a timely, confidential and professionally supportive manner, can be successfully resolved. Carnegie Mellon has established an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), sponsored and paid for by the university, to facilitate employees' efforts to resolve problems that can affect job performance and general well-being. Employees can contact the EAP on their own or they may be referred by management. Employees' household members are also eligible to use this benefit.\nFeatures\nCarnegie Mellon has contracted with ComPsych, a private counseling and service organization, to administer EAP services through the GuidanceResources program. GuidanceResources provides free confidential assessment and referral services for Carnegie Mellon employees and their household members. Typical issues that may be addressed include drug and alcohol abuse, marital problems, psychological problems, and legal or financial difficulties. GuidanceResources also provides a website and other informational resources about important issues.\nCounseling \u00a0Employees and their household members can contact a professional GuidanceResources counselor at any time by calling 844-744-1370. The counselor can help identify and resolve issues and, when necessary, make referrals to other providers for specialized or long-term treatment or assistance. Counseling through GuidanceResources is voluntary, even if recommended to an employess by management. Counseling will not jeopardize an employee's job security or promotional opportunities; nor does it relieve an employee of the responsibility for meeting acceptable job performance and attendance records.\nWebsite\u00a0 GuidanceResources maintains a website where employees and their household members can find extensive information on issues such as health and wellness, child and elder care, financial planning and many other topics. To use the website, the Company WebID is Carnegie.\nCost\u00a0 There is no cost for GuidanceResources assessments or referrals; however, there may be fees for the services of other providers. Such fees are the responsibility of the employee or houseold member and his or her health insurance. GuidaneResources will coordinate referrals, whenever possible, to take advantage of existing insurance coverage in order to minimize costs to the employee.\nConfidentiality\u00a0 Information regarding employees or household members using GuidanceResources services will be held in strictest confidence by\u00a0GuidanceResources personnel.\u00a0GuidanceResources will not release information regarding an individual's problem without the individual's written authorization.\nGuidelines for\u00a0Supervisors\nSupervisors can refer employees to\u00a0GuidanceResources based on:\n\nA request by the employee for assistance with a personal issue;\nA pattern of decline in an employee's work performance or attendance; or\nA particular on the job incident that indicates the possible presence of personal problems.\n\nCounseling through\u00a0GuidanceResources is voluntary, even if recommended to an employee by management. Counseling will not jeopardize an employee's job security or promotional opportunities. At the same time, counseling does not relieve an employee of responsibility for meeting acceptable job performance and attendance standards. Supervisors can contact Human Resources if they have questions about the appropriate way to handle an employee relations issue. Supervisors should not try to diagnose or solve an employee's personal problems.\nTime Off for Counseling\u00a0\nEmployees are expected to use\u00a0GuidanceResources services on their own time. Time off from work to attend counseling is treated the same as other absences due to personal illness, injury or medical appointments. Arrangements should be made with the employee's supervisor in advance to schedule time away from work or make up any lost time.\nTraining\u00a0\nSpecialized training for faculty, supervisors, and upper-level administrators will be offered to help them recognize job performance problems that may be the result of personal problems or substance abuse. Other seminars and workshops will be made available as necessary.\nDrug Free Workplace\u00a0Statement\nCarnegie Mellon recognizes that abuse of alcohol or other controlled substances on campus can be detrimental to the campus environment and, in the case of controlled substances, may be illegal. The use of alcohol and other addictive substances by university employees is of concern because such use can interfere with an individual's health, emotional well-being, and effective job performance.\nThe Employee Policy on Illegal Drugs, distributed annually to campus in the Alcohol and Drug Brochure further specifies university policy with regard to controlled substances and the Carnegie Mellon workplace. In support of these policies, the EAP will assist Carnegie Mellon by:\n\nProviding educational awareness programs available to all employees regarding use, abuse, and addiction to alcohol and other drugs as they affect individuals and their household members.\n\n\nTraining supervisors and managers to recognize the possible effects of the use of alcohol and other drugs on job performance and introducing supportive methods of offering assistance to employees who recognize their own disability and are interested in seeking help.\n\n\nProviding confidential referral to rehabilitation resources for employees desiring treatment, counseling or other professional assistance with substance abuse problems.\n\n\nProviding a mechanism for referral to rehabilitation resources for employees found to be in violation of the Employee Policy on Illegal Drugs.\n\n\nInforming employees and their household members of the availability of the EAP, particularly as it relates to the family nature of the disease of addiction to alcohol and other drugs and to direct immediate household members toward utilization of this service.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon will accord employees with alcohol and other addictions the same respect and consideration given employees with other diseases and disabilities and provide a supportive and encouraging work environment to those recovering employees.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs or alcohol by students or employees on Carnegie Mellon University property or as part of any of its activities is prohibited. Compliance with the following policy is mandatory and violation of the policy will be cause for disciplinary action.The university is committed to complying with applicable laws relating to unlawful possession, use or distribution of alcohol or illicit drugs (referenced below) and reflects that compliance in its policies and procedures.\u00a0\nCarnegie Mellon faculty, administrators, staff and students recognize the responsibility and potential harm inherent in the use of alcoholic beverages. The following policy governs all university social activities on and off campus at which alcoholic beverages will be served. For purposes of this policy, university social activities are any social activities on university property or for which university funds or other resources are used. All members of the university community have an individual and collective responsibility to adhere to the following policy:\n\nIn all circumstances, the university expects its faculty, administrators, staff, students, alumni and their respective guests to conduct themselves, both individually and collectively, in a responsible manner. Illegal, abusive or excessive consumption of alcohol resulting in interference with the rights of other persons, personal injury or damage to property will result in severe disciplinary action, beginning with monetary sanctions, up to and including suspension or expulsion.\nIn residential areas such as private residence hall rooms, campus apartments, fraternities or sororities, there exists an expectation of privacy; however, in these areas members of the university and their guests are still governed by federal, state and local laws (or applicable laws for other jurisdictions where Carnegie Mellon operates) and will be responsible for their own behavior. In addition, any actions which violate the law and\/or the rights of others, or in some way damage personal or public property, will result in the loss of the above-mentioned privacy rights and will be cause for university intervention and enforcement.\nPermission to serve alcoholic beverages at a social activity where students will or may be in attendance can only be obtained through the dean of Student Affairs. Before permission is given, a dean, department head, faculty member or staff member who is on the exempt payroll must take personal responsibility for ensuring that alcoholic beverages are served only to those persons who are of legal age. Such responsibility may be assumed only after completing the Social Host Responsibility session offered through the Campus Police. This session will be offered periodically throughout the year. Please contact the Campus Police at 412-268-2323 for details.\nIn addition, the following guidelines must be observed for all events:\n\nSocial activities at which alcoholic beverages are served must take place in an area that is private or semi-private. Privacy is determined by the ability to control access to the area of the social activity and limit attendance to invited guests only. Alcoholic beverages are not to be consumed anywhere outdoors on the grounds of Carnegie Mellon. Therefore, alcoholic beverages are prohibited at social activities on the Cut, on the Mall, on the fraternity area grounds, on housing grounds, on the athletic field or on any other similar outdoor area either owned or used by the university.\nA fee must never be charged for the service of alcohol where prohibited by applicable law or without obtaining the appropriate license or meeting the appropriate legal requirements to do so.\nPublic advertising of events at which alcohol is to be served must not include any reference to alcohol, nor may such events be publicly posted outside of the university community.\n\n\nPolicy Statement Regarding Illegal Drugs\nThe unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of illicit drugs is prohibited at Carnegie Mellon University.\nCarnegie Mellon Student Policy on Illegal Drugs\nThe university cannot deny access to its property to properly constituted law enforcement agents. Therefore, activity involving the unlawful use or sale of drugs by one student may also, by bringing law enforcement agents to the campus, risk compromising the privacy of the academic community. With the legal and medical\u00a0 welfare of the student in mind, the university cannot approve the medically unsupervised use, possession or distribution of drugs. When such medically unsupervised use, possession or distribution of drugs comes to the attention of the university, the student will be subject to disciplinary action which could include suspension or expulsion.In any instance where a violation of the laws concerning drugs occurs on the Carnegie Mellon campus or in connection with the activities of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s students, the disciplinary policy of the university will permit taking action beyond or separate from any which may be taken by other authorities.Campus police officers at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Pittsburgh campus must follow Pennsylvania rules of Criminal Procedure and Rules of Evidence when discovering illegal drugs on campus, and then take appropriate legal action.The medically unsupervised possession, use or distribution of potentially harmful drugs such as marijuana, hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates and opiates is illegal and subject to very harsh penalties. Although the university does not assume the responsibility of acting as an arm of the law, members of the academic community have no immunity from enforcement of the law. Use of many of these drugs may threaten the physical and mental health of the user. Use by one student may also threaten the welfare of other students. Distribution by any student clearly threatens the welfare of the academic community.\nNote Regarding Medical Marijuana\nIn April 2016, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed the Medical Marijuana Act of 2016, legalizing certain forms of medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. However, Carnegie Mellon remains bound by various federal narcotics laws that prohibit the distribution, use and possession of marijuana. In particular, Carnegie Mellon complies with the federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989.

Questions on policy content should be directed to the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist, University Libraries, ext. 8-7268.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtistic properties are obtained by donation. Policy details considerations for acquisition and management of the collection.\n\n\n\n\n \nPolicy Statement\nThe acceptance of all gifts and bequests must be approved by the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist. No commitment will be made as to exhibition, attribution or placement of the gift. While it is the university's intention to accession for long-term use and preservation, no guarantee will be made that the gift or bequest will be retained by the university in perpetuity. All legal and\/or tax considerations of related Artistic Properties contributions will be coordinated with the Office of Planned Giving in the Development division.\nReason for the Policy\nWorks of the fine or decorative arts (artistic properties) are collected and exhibited by Carnegie Mellon University to enhance the quality of life on campus, stimulate education and research, and to preserve such works for posterity. The purpose of the Artistic Properties Committee at Carnegie Mellon is to serve as an advisory body to the University Libraries, which is charged with the responsibility of managing and exhibiting artistic properties owned by the university.\nThe Artistic Properties Committee\nThe Artistic Properties Committee is appointed by the president. The members comprising this committee serve in their specialized positions to discuss issues and policies concerning the Artistic Properties Collection. It is the committee's role to oversee the collection, management and exhibition of artistic properties owned by the university.  The committee approves policies and procedures, advises the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist on questions of difficult acquisitions, and approves all dispositions. Any unresolved questions regarding procedures for security, conservation, registration, inventory, storage, installation or other activities applicable to the collection will be referred to the committee. Issues brought before the committee will be put to a vote. The decision of the majority will be honored.\nDefinition of Artistic Properties\nThe Artistic Properties Collection of Carnegie Mellon University includes, but is not limited to, paintings on canvas and panel; art works on paper (prints, watercolors, drawings in all media, pastels, photographs, scrolls); works on parchment, papyrus and vellum; sculpture; antique furnishings (furniture, carpets, vases, chandeliers, ceramics, medals, coins, stamps); and anthropological artifacts.\nCurated Artistic Properties\nThe Artistic Properties Collection does not include works of art on campus that are part of a separate university collection or that are curated by another department on campus; that is, catalogued, inventoried and conserved in a controlled environment. Examples of these collections include those managed by the University Libraries (Special Collections), Hunt Institute and the H&SS Advising Center (Adamson Wing). Although these collections are not part of Artistic Properties, the University Libraries are responsible for assessing security and inventory for them.\nAcquiring and Maintaining Artistic Properties\nNotification of Donations\nThe Archives & Art Inventory Specialist will be responsible for inventorying and maintaining current accession files of all works of art on campus owned by the university. Therefore, the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist must be notified within 15 working days of the receipt of a donation. Copies of any correspondence relating to the donation must be forwarded to the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist.\nMaintenance\nMaintenance of the collection includes inventorying and cataloging the holdings, preparation of descriptive labels for display of artistic properties, preservation and restoration, storage of inactive artistic properties, and inventory control.\nSecurity\nAs an educational institution, Carnegie Mellon University will strive to provide maximum accessibility of the collections to the public. However, factors such as the security, safety and location of the artistic properties must all be taken into consideration when providing access.  Security issues will be addressed when considering the placement of works of art in specific locations at the university. The Archives & Art Inventory Specialist will be responsible for gathering information regarding various security factors and may reject potential locations for the display of artistic properties due to security concerns.\nProcedures for Disposition of Artistic Properties\nThe university must be aware of its role as trustee of the collections for the benefit of the university and its community. However, when it is deemed prudent to do so, the university may consider relinquishing artistic property.  Basic considerations to be addressed in requests for disposition:\n\nIs the object no longer relevant or useful to the purpose and activities of the university?\nIs there danger of not being able to preserve the object properly?\nHas the object deteriorated beyond usefulness? (To be decided after restoration and conservation procedures have been reviewed.)\nIs it doubtful that the object can be exhibited or used as a teaching tool in the foreseeable future?\nWill disposition provide the means for improving or strengthening the collection in order to further the goals of the university?\n\nAll requests for disposition, regardless of size, value, etc., of artistic properties must be recommended for disposition well in advance of the date the action is to be considered. This is to ensure that ample time is available to research all legal and tax considerations as well as to consider the university's relationship with the donor.  The Artistic Property Committee must approve any disposition of works in the Artistic Properties Collection. The person\/department initiating such action will provide the Artistic Properties Committee with an explanation of what is being relinquished and the reason for the action. All objects that are intended to be relinquished will be subject to a vote by the committee. The decision of the majority will be honored. Outside opinions may be solicited before reaching a decision.  When recommending any method of disposition, the Artistic Properties Committee will address the reasons for the selection of such method. Documentation on disposition regarding destruction must be filed with the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist at the time of disposal.  If artistic properties curated by a department other than the Artistic Properties Office are to be relinquished, the Archives & Art Inventory Specialist must be notified in a timely manner in order to keep files and inventory current.  All proceeds from the sale of artwork in the Artistic Properties Collection will be deposited into the Artistic Properties account.

Questions on policy content should be directed to Environmental Health and Safety, ext. 8-8182, or to any other designated contact listed in this policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Health and Safety (EH&S) is authorized to implement programs and plans designed to ensure compliance and maintain a safe and healthy environment for the campus community.\n\n\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe Staff Handbook\nThe Word\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nCarnegie Mellon University endeavors to maintain a safe and healthy environment for its students, faculty, staff, visitors and members of the general public by:\n\nFollowing established standards relating to environmental protection and personal safety. The objective will be to minimize the risk of injury or illness to people and minimize property damage at all locations where university operations and\/or activities occur.\nComplying in all material aspects with applicable codes, standards and regulations.\u00a0\n\n\nDefinition of Responsibility and Authority\nAdministrative Responsibility\nThe president has ultimate authority for Carnegie Mellon's compliance with environmental, health and safety standards and policies at all facilities under university control. The president has authorized the department of Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) and its director to coordinate the university's environmental health and safety programs and to monitor the university's compliance with appropriate standards and policies.\nAdministrators who head all academic and administrative units of the university (colleges, schools, departments, institutes, centers, libraries, student affairs, etc.) as well as principal investigators of research programs, and supervisors of academic programs, are responsible for compliance with campus environmental health and safety standards and policies in the departments and centers under their authority. In carrying out their responsibilities for overall compliance, these administration and supervisors, or their representatives, will consult as needed with EH&S regarding compliance with university, environmental, health, and safety standards.\nDepartmental Responsibility\nAdministrators of all academic and administrative units of the university have the authority to see that their department members and affiliates receive compliance training regarding potential hazards associated with each person's employment with Carnegie Mellon University. These administrators will also assist EH&S periodically to update employee compliance training records.\nPrincipal investigators and supervisors are responsible for assessing the potential hazards associated with the tasks of the participants in the programs under their authority, and also for determining their ability to perform those tasks safely. Therefore, each principal investigator or supervisor is responsible for making sure that the participants in their programs are adequately trained. If participants' competence to perform assigned tasks safely is insufficient, as well as when a new job duty is assigned, or when new equipment or processes are introduced, they must be provided with compliance training.\nEH&S Authority\nThrough technical assistance and oversight EH&S will direct the campus toward compliance with environmental health & safety practices that are required by laws or regulations. EH&S shall have the authority to audit and recommend appropriate corrective or planning strategies, including the development of safety programs. EH&S will consult with external agencies or regulatory bodies as necessary and appropriate, on behalf of the university.\n1. Corrective Action Reports and Citations \nEH&S is authorized to survey and monitor all areas of the campus to assess environmental risks, life safety exposures, and training requirements, and to recommend improvements. EH&S will submit written reports identifying hazards and recommending corrective action. In the presence of severe hazards or in the case of non-compliance with local, state, and federal regulations or university policies, improvements will be required.\nEH&S's director or designee has the authority to issue, following appropriate investigation, noncompliance citations to the appropriate individuals and administrators for lack of improvements in response to a formal report or recommendation.\nCopies of any formal reports and noncompliance citations associated with unsafe work practices will be provided to the individual, his or her immediate supervisor, and to other administrators with responsibility for the activity involved. Copies of reports and\/or citations given to individual students or student organizations will be forwarded to the dean of Student Affairs. The dean or designee will determine an appropriate resolution utilizing the normal student disciplinary processes as outlined in The Word. Performance evaluations of all employees will include review of noncompliance citations, as they relate to their job duties.\nTo appeal noncompliance citations:\n\nStaff members are to use the grievance procedure that is outlined in the Staff Handbook.\nStudents are to use the disciplinary process outlined in the University Policy section of The Word. Students may contact the Coordinator for Community Standards in the Student Life Office at ext. 8-2142 for more information.\nUnion members may file a grievance through their union stewards.\nFaculty members may meet to seek redress from their department head, and\/or the dean of their school, or if appropriate, file a grievance with the Faculty Review Committee.\n\n2. Cessation of Hazardous Activities\nEH&S's director or designee has the authority to immediately suspend or restrict any operation that\n\npresents a serious hazard (real or potential) associated with the health, life, safety, or welfare of campus personnel or the public, or\nis found to be a violation of standards, or\nis detrimental to the environment.\n\nIf he or she is available, assistance from the relevant administrator, principal investigator or supervisor will be requested.\nIn the event that EH&S orders cessation of an activity, EH&S will immediately communicate the problem(s) and violation(s) to the individual, to his or her direct supervisor, to other administrators with responsibility for the department or center involved and the appropriate regulatory agency when required by law.\nThe activity may be resumed only with the approval of the EH&S director or designee in consultation with the provost or vice president as appropriate and the relevant administrators or supervisors.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of Sponsored Programs, ext. 8-7291.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nUniversities have two primary purposes: to create knowledge and to disseminate knowledge. Carnegie Mellon University recognizes the importance of open intellectual communication within a research group, within the university, and within the larger community outside. Ideally, all units of the university would disseminate the results of research as quickly and as widely as possible. Some members or units of the university, however, desire to do research that may be difficult or impossible without restrictions or without access to classified or proprietary materials.\nThere exists, therefore, a tension between the university's goal of disseminating knowledge freely and the desire on the part of some of its members to conduct restricted research on important problems. The university intends to guarantee the academic freedom of all faculty members to do research in their own manner on topics of their own choosing, provided that such research is consistent with the overall purposes of the university.\nThis policy seeks to resolve the tension between the desire to participate in restricted research and the desire to maintain the open atmosphere of the university by confining restricted research to semi-autonomous units, which are not associated with any academic departments. It thereby establishes the principle that restricted research is inappropriate at Carnegie Mellon University except in the semi-autonomous units.\nThis policy does not attempt to anticipate all possible concerns about restricted research. In some cases, decisions will need to be made about particular research projects to which the application of particular policy guidelines are not clear. In choosing to accept or decline such projects, the university will weigh the potential of a project for generating and disseminating new knowledge, for the benefit of society, against the project's potential for adversely affecting the climate for research conducted in a free and open environment. While this policy sets no explicit limits on the extent of classified research permitted in the semi-autonomous units, it is not the intent of the policy to encourage any unit of the university to engage in classified research as a primary ongoing activity. Indeed, it is expected that classified projects will never represent more than a small fraction of the total research effort in any unit.\nDefinitions\nResearch: all projects and investigations involving the creation of new knowledge of a theoretical or practical nature. The term \"research\" as used here encompasses both \"research\" and \"development\" as they are commonly defined.\nClassified research: research, the free dissemination of the results of which is deemed to jeopardize national security. The federal government controls access to the environment in which such research is performed, restricts discussions about the work in progress to individuals with clearance and a \"need to know,\" and limits publication of research, results or access to data needed to verify results, for a specified period of time.\nProprietary research: research that results in intellectual property that is owned by entities other than Carnegie Mellon University. Such entities may wish to market products derived from inventions or ideas that are developed at the university. They might, therefore, desire to fund projects which restrict access to data and to discussions about work in progress to individuals with a \"need to know,\" and to seek, for a specified period of time, a delay in publication of research results or data needed to verify results. Such entities may also provide access to proprietary material, which researchers must agree not to include in publications.\nPublication: oral or written dissemination.\nRestricted research: includes all classified research, and any proprietary or other research that requires more than a six month delay in publication of the research results.\nSemi-autonomous units: units of the university specifically so designated by the president, after consultation with the URC and the Faculty Senate, currently the Mellon Institute and the Software Engineering Institute.\nNon-autonomous units: all university entities other than semi-autonomous units.\nRestricted Research in Non-Autonomous Units\nIt is the policy of Carnegie Mellon that restricted research is inappropriate and, therefore, not permitted within its non-autonomous units.\nIt is also the policy of Carnegie Mellon not to permit involvement of students in projects which carry restrictions that may impede their progress toward a degree. Therefore, students should not be involved in contracts that require the delay of a student's publication of research results when such results are intended for use in obtaining academic credit, except that a sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of proprietary information that was provided by the sponsor for the conduct of the research.\nProprietary research is allowed within non-autonomous units provided it is subject to limitations (excluding students' publications as noted above) no more stringent than the following:\n\nA sponsor may request a delay of up to six months in publication so that steps may be taken to secure intellectual property rights to inventions or ideas developed under the contract.\nA sponsor may require a delay of thirty days for review of publications for removal of proprietary information which was provided for the conduct of the research.\n\nConsiderations for Faculty\/Researchers\nThe university recognizes that problems arise in both restricted research and research that is not itself restricted but that involves access to classified or propriety information or materials (hereinafter, restricted materials). Researchers may also have access to restricted materials when serving as consultants. Access to restricted materials gives rise to concerns about limitations on researchers' freedom to communicate. In such instances, researchers must exercise considerable judgment to conduct their research in an open environment while protecting the restricted materials to which they have access. Researchers must also be aware that the university will judge their performance as researchers through their publications or through other scholarly products that arise from their research. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for public review, cannot be considered in promotion or reappointment decisions or in evaluations of academic performance of any kind.\nConsiderations for Students\nThere are important concerns about the involvement of students in restricted research. It is necessary for students to publish their work in order to obtain degrees, course credit and professional recognition. Students rely to a large degree on their faculty advisor's judgment for guidance and advice. Research that is restricted in dissemination, or not available for public review, cannot be used for academic credit. Thus, before working on such research, a student must be notified in writing that work on this research may not be used for academic credit.\nRestricted Research in Semi-Autonomous Units\nThe semi-autonomous units associated with Carnegie Mellon may conduct restricted research.\nFaculty members may conduct restricted research in or in cooperation with semi-autonomous units only on a consulting basis or by means of a formal, internal leave of absence from their non-autonomous units.\nWork that is restricted in any way may not be used for academic evaluations until it is released for publication, and then only with respect to future academic actions.\nStudents may occasionally be employed by the semi-autonomous units, provided that such employment does not interfere substantially with progress toward a degree. However, they must be made aware that work that is restricted cannot be used for academic credit. Work that was restricted and is later released for dissemination and review can be applied toward future academic credit. Students should be discouraged from working on restricted research in which dissemination may be delayed indefinitely.\nGuidelines for all Units\nWork by students on restricted research projects shall not be made a condition for admission or financial aid.\nThe principal investigator is responsible for informing all members of a project (faculty, staff and students) of any restrictions imposed on the dissemination of information related to the research. This must be done prior to the start of the project or prior to an individual joining an existing project.\nRestrictions on access to university facilities due to the conduct of restricted research must be kept to a minimum. Access to and movement through the facilities in which restricted research is conducted must be consistent with standard university procedures.\nThe Provost's Office is responsible for obtaining signed documents from principal investigators on restricted research projects attesting that they are aware of all restrictions imposed on the research and that they have informed all participants of these restrictions.\nThe Office of Sponsored Research shall review all proposals and contracts prior to approval for conformity with these guidelines. Any that do not meet these guidelines will be referred to the University Research Council (URC) for review and recommendation of appropriate action to the provost.\nTo maintain a balance with the university's goals of broad dissemination of knowledge, the URC will conduct an annual review of all restricted research being conducted at the university. This review will be made based on a listing of all contracts that involve restricted research. This listing shall include the title and sponsor(s) of the research, name(s) of principal investigator(s), and the amount of funding of each contract.\nThe university community will be informed annually, through the URC's written report to the Faculty Senate and Student Senate, of the nature and overall impact of restricted research at Carnegie Mellon.\nExisting sponsored research projects shall be allowed to continue under the terms of their present contract.

It was then updated and approved by the President's Council on November 10, 2008 (effective January 1, 2009) as the Carnegie Mellon Smoking Policy. On December 13, 2016 the policy was approved as the Carnegie Mellon University Smoke-Less Campus Policy (effective August 25, 2017).\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nOffice of the Vice President for Operations. Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, ext. 8-8182.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoking policy restricts smoking in most areas but provides procedures for designating and posting smoking areas.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Rationale\nThe University is committed to promoting a safe, healthy working and learning environment. This commitment extends to encouraging and supporting the reduction of significant health risks to members of the community. Smoking of tobacco products is one such risk. This Policy is intended not only to relieve community members from negative effects of tobacco smoking by others, but also to promote and assist smoking cessation by existing users and discourage new addictions. Policies that strictly regulate smoking have been demonstrated to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke, tobacco-related death and disease, and attendant healthcare costs. In addition, several systematic reviews of studies have demonstrated effectiveness of such policies in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use, increasing the number of tobacco users who quit, and reducing the initiation of tobacco use among young people. These positive effects have led leading national health organizations to advocate a smoke-free policy intervention. Benchmarking suggests that a \u201csmoke-less\u201d approach, an alternative to prohibition that honors our campus geography and is grounded in sustained and visible efforts to reduce smoking and promote cessation, can also have positive effects. The effects of exposure to smoke from tobacco were documented in the 2006, 2010, and 2014 U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s Reports. Further research is needed to determine the public health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes and other novel nicotine products. Although harmful consequences of e-cigarette vapor have not been demonstrated to the standards used for conventional cigarettes, the practice of using these products may have social impact. In addition, some state and local governments, including Allegheny County, have passed laws regulating the use of e-cigarettes. Therefore, this Policy addresses both the smoking of tobacco products and the use of e-cigarettes. As evidence becomes more conclusive, this Policy may be amended to further address novel nicotine products.\nPolicy Statement\nSmoking of tobacco products is prohibited in all university buildings and facilities owned, leased, or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, including campus vehicles. Smoking of tobacco products is also prohibited on all grounds and outside areas except for limited designated outdoor areas where the negative effects of second-hand exposure is deemed sufficiently low. As such, major campus thoroughfares, gathering spaces and entrances to buildings will be free from any designated areas. The number, nature and location of these designated areas will be determined by an oversight committee convened by the university\u2019s Environmental Health and Safety department and comprised of representatives from Faculty Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, Staff Council and Student Senate.\nThe initial placement of designated areas will be determined during the fall semester of 2017 for implementation in 2018. Prior to implementation, a plan will be communicated addressing cessation support and placement of designated areas.\nUse of e-cigarettes and vaporizers is prohibited inside all university buildings and inside all property owned, leased or operated by Carnegie Mellon University, but is not prohibited outside on campus grounds as of the adoption of this Policy.\nFor the purpose of this Policy, a tobacco product is defined as any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption by smoking. Examples of tobacco products include, but are not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, and pipe tobacco.\nFor the purpose of this Policy, an e-cigarette is defined as any electronic oral device, such as one composed of a heating element, battery or electronic circuit, which provides a vapor of nicotine or any other substances and the use or inhalation of which simulates smoking. The term shall include any such device, whether manufactured, distributed, marketed or sold as an e-cigarette, e-cigar or e-pipe or under any other product name or descriptor.\nThis Policy does not apply to the use of tobacco products, e-cigarettes or vaporizers for official academic research so long as such use of these products complies with all applicable local, state, and federal laws.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

For academic year 2018-2019 this fee is $131 per semester\/$262 per year for undergraduate students, and $108 per semester\/$216 per year for graduate students. Student Government is responsible for administering the fee and for using it only for the support of projects under the following guidelines:\n\nActivities and facilities which can be described as meeting the reasonably predictable social, cultural, recreational, or welfare needs of college students.\nPublications which can reasonably be presumed to serve the needs of the student community for communication, expressions of opinion, and the conduct of their business.\nSuch enterprises of an entrepreneurial nature undertaken by the student body as can reasonably be expected to serve as an instrument for meeting the needs described above.\n\nAll functions and services provided by the fees described above must be in accordance with Carnegie Mellon's policy of non-discrimination. In addition, no use of such fees may be intended to violate or circumvent the policies of the university or the laws of the land.  Final responsibility for establishing the amount of any required fee rests with the Board of Trustees, which will consider changes only upon requests of the Student Government and the officers of the university.  Note:\u00a0 Historically, the Student Government has dedicated a specific portion of graduate students' activities fees to the Graduate Student Assembly to be used at their discretion.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to Campus Design and Facility Development, ext. 8-6156.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPolicy Statement\nPublic Art is permanent or long-term art in public spaces on campus. This policy addresses the review, acquisition, acceptance, siting, and deaccessioning of public art.\u00a0 Accepted public art becomes the management responsibility of the Department of Campus Design and Facility Development in the Office of the Vice President for Finance and the Chief Financial Officer.\u00a0\nArt enhances the quality of life for all people and should be a part of the daily life of the students, faculty, and staff at Carnegie Mellon.\u00a0 Carnegie Mellon is a leader in education for the arts and creative research and practice, and art on the campus and in public building spaces should reflect this leadership status. Acquired public art should expand the educational mission of the university and the College of Fine Arts by providing interesting and challenging work of high quality, accompanied by an interpretive program to make the works accessible to the non-specialist.\nThe Public Art Committee (PAC) is established to:\n\nReview specific proposals for public art with the purpose of recommending to the president approval, suggestions for modification, or rejection of the public art, and its siting.\u00a0\nClarify the need for public art on the Carnegie Mellon campus and target specific siting opportunities, including both indoor and outdoor public spaces.\u00a0 This work builds on the campus master planning process.\n\nPublic art is acquired through donations, solicitations, purchases, and loans.\u00a0 It should be recognized that the advocacy and selection of public art can be controversial and, at times, technically difficult.\u00a0 Public art selection must address such issues as:\u00a0 artistic quality, appropriateness, site context, public sensibility, durability, maintainability, safety and cost.\nGiven the world class stature of our College of Fine Arts and many of its graduates, the university would be particularly pleased to have the opportunity to consider works by prominent alumni and faculty to celebrate their leadership contribution to their discipline and the world of art.\nAs the university's financial strength becomes more robust and such funds become available, it is the university's aspiration that major new campus facilities projects will allocate a percentage of project funds for the acquisition, commission and\/or integration of public art that will enhance the contribution of the new facility to the quality of campus life.\u00a0 If acquisition funding can be raised, consideration must also be given to maintenance and the future maintenance of the art endowed.\nDefinition\nPublic Art at Carnegie Mellon is considered to be permanent or long-term art in public spaces on campus, including all outdoor campus space and interior public spaces such as lobbies, social spaces, etc.\u00a0 The PAC does not presume any authority over works of art, photographs, etc. that faculty and staff place on view in their offices or that departments install in their offices and teaching spaces.\u00a0 Art is considered permanent if it is installed with no anticipated time limit or duration.\u00a0 This policy does not address student or faculty art installations with a defined time limit, and which are covered by separate guidelines and coordinated by the College of Fine Arts.\u00a0\nProcess\nThe Public Art Committee is advisory to the president and all proposed public art and its proposed site must be reviewed by the Public Art Committee and approved by the president and the Property and Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees before it is accepted by the university.\u00a0 The PAC meets on an ad hoc basis as public art proposals require review, or to address other public art planning issues.\u00a0 Recommendations of the PAC shall be upon a vote of the majority of members convened.\u00a0 The Design Review Committee must be consulted on proposals for outdoor sites that require integration into the campus master plan.\nIn order to ensure that the PAC has the opportunity to receive input from all campus constituencies, prior to recommending acceptance of a piece of public art the PAC shall hold at least one public meeting which all interested members may attend for purposes of hearing about and offering comment on the proposed piece.\u00a0 Representatives of the primary user(s) of the space where the public art is to be sited must also be consulted.\nCarnegie Mellon welcomes temporary installations in public spaces organized by departments or individuals.\u00a0 There is no need for the PAC to monitor short exhibits (six weeks or less).\u00a0 Exhibits of the Miller Gallery are also exempted from review by the PAC.\nPublic Art Committee Membership\nThe PAC is chaired by the dean of the College of Fine Arts.\u00a0 An appropriate staff member designated by the provost shall provide administrative support. The PAC is made up of campus representatives who provide necessary judgmental and technical expertise.\u00a0 Members shall include:\nEx officio\u00a0 \nDean, College of Fine Arts (Chair) Head, School of Art Director, Miller Art Gallery Associate Vice President for Campus Design and Facility Development (non-voting) Secretary of the Corporation; Chief of Staff, Office of the President (non-voting) Vice President, Advancement (non-voting)\nFaculty\nThe University recognizes that it is important for the PAC to have wide-ranging input, including from faculty of the university who are non-specialists in the field of art.\u00a0 In order to ensure that the views of non-specialist faculty are represented, three faculty members shall be appointed on a staggered basis by the deans of the Mellon College of Science, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Institute of Technology, School of Computer Science, College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Heinz School of Public Policy, according to the process set forth below.\nFor the first year of appointments to the Committee:\n\n\n\nDean\nNo. of members appointed\nTerm\n\n\nMellon College of Science\n1\n3 years\n\n\nTepper School of Business\u00a0\n1\n2 years\n\n\nCarnegie Institute of Technology\n1\n1 year\n\n\n\n \nFor the second year of appointments to the Committee:\n\n\n\nDean\nNo. of members appointed\nTerm\n\n\nSchool of Computer Science\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1\n3 years\n\n\n\n \nFor the third year of appointments to the Committee:\n\n\n\nDean\nNo. of members appointed\nTerm\n\n\nDietrich College\u00a0\n1\n3 years\n\n\n\n \nFor the fourth year of appointments to the Committee, and for every year thereafter, one dean shall appoint one member of his or her school's or college's faculty for a three year term in the following order:\u00a0 The Heinz School of Public Policy (Year 4), Mellon College of Science (Year 5), Tepper School of Business (Year 6), Carnegie Institute of Technology (Year 7), School of Computer Science (Year 8) and College of Humanities and Social Sciences (Year 9) and so on and so forth such that at all times the Committee shall have three members who are faculty of the aforementioned schools and colleges.\u00a0 The unexpired term of any vacancy created by the resignation or death of any member shall be filled by the dean that appointed the original member.\nTrustees\nTwo trustees, designated by the chair of the Property & Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees, appointed for terms of two years each.\nStudents\nTwo undergraduate students selected by the Student Senate and two graduate students selected by the Graduate Student Assembly, appointed for terms of one year each.\nStaff\nOne staff member selected by the Staff Council, appointed for a term of two years.\nExternal Community\nOne member, designated by the provost in consultation with the chair of the PAC and the Property & Facilities Committee of the Board of Trustees (e.g. a prominent alumnus\/a, a Pittsburgh-based museum director, or the head of a regional arts organization), appointed for a term of two years.\nThe PAC membership also shall include at least one member of the Design Review Committee (who can be one of the individuals named above) and the Artistic Properties Committee (who shall be the university librarian serving as the university archivist or other librarian designated by him\/her).\u00a0 The PAC may call on others in the campus community or outside consultants for their technical expertise as approved by the Provost.\u00a0\nCriteria for Acceptance\/Rejection of Public Art\nThe PAC will use the following criteria in considering gifts or purchases of public art:\n\nProposed art shall display a high level of artistic quality and craftsmanship that supports and enhances the academic and creative missions of Carnegie Mellon. Distinctive works of art chosen or created for campus public space shall be of sufficiently high quality to merit inclusion into Carnegie Mellon's permanent collection.\n\n\nThe \"message\" of proposed art, if any, shall be acceptable to current standards and policies of the Carnegie Mellon community.\n\n\nAn appropriate site in campus public space shall be available.\n\n\nProposed art shall be structurally sound and present no environmental or safety hazard.\n\n\nAn external funding source to cover all costs of acquisition, purchase, shipping, installation, wall-to-wall insurance, appraisal, and maintenance shall be determined prior to acceptance. If sufficient funding is not immediately available, this criterion may be waived in exceptional circumstances by the president.\n\n\nThe donor's clear title to donated art and authenticity of the work shall be confirmed prior to acceptance.\n\nOwnership and Deaccessioning\nOwnership and acquisition terms will be determined by the standard gift agreement between the university and the donor of public art.\u00a0 The university, with the approval of the PAC, reserves the right to sell or donate works of public art.\u00a0\nCriteria for Deaccessioning\nThe PAC may consider the deaccessioning of artwork for one or more of the following reasons in the event that it cannot be resited:\n\nA work is not, or is only rarely, on display because of lack of a suitable site.\nThe condition or security of the artwork cannot be reasonably guaranteed.\nThe artwork has been damaged or has deteriorated and repair is impractical or unfeasible.\nThe artwork endangers public safety.\nIn the case of site specific artwork, the artwork\u2019s relationship to the site is altered because of changes to the site.\nThe artwork has been determined to be incompatible within the context of the collection.\nThe university, with the concurrence of the PAC, wishes to replace the artwork with work of more significance by the same artist.\nThe artwork requires excessive maintenance or has faults of design or workmanship.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

University officials seeking to establish a non-endowed named professorship should contact the Office of the Provost.\n\nPurpose and Creation of Institutional Chairs\nThe creation of an Institutional Chair is typically reserved to honor faculty for extraordinary scholarly achievements, for faculty in retention cases, or when the creation of such a chair is demonstrated to be in the best interest of the university.\nThe Board of Trustees or the President of the university may create an Institutional Chair at their discretion.\nAcademic and administrative leaders of the university\u2019s colleges and schools may propose the creation of an Institutional Chair to the Provost. Upon the recommendation of the Provost, the President may approve such a proposed Institutional Chair.\n\nGuidelines\nThe following guidelines apply to the naming of Institutional Chairs at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU):\n\nAn Institutional Chair for a senior faculty member may be called a \u201cTrustees Chair in [field of study].\u201d There is no limit on the number of Trustees Chairs that may exist.\nAn Institutional Chair for a junior faculty member may be called a \u201cCarnegie Mellon Promise Chair in [field of study].\u201d There is no limit on the number of Carnegie Mellon Promise Chairs that may exist.\nThe following types of individuals may be honored with the naming of an Institutional Chair:\nA CMU faculty member or staff member who has demonstrated extraordinary scholarly achievement or made extraordinary contributions to the life of the university, provided that the individual is deceased, or has been retired or otherwise separated from CMU for at least five years;\nAn individual with a CMU connection who has demonstrated extraordinary achievement in the field of study for the intended chair, or who has made extraordinary contributions to the life of the university, provided that the individual has been deceased for at least five years; or\nA donor who contributed an unrestricted gift sufficient to create the Institutional Chair (i.e., a donor who left an unrestricted bequest, or a bequest for faculty support).\n\n\nUniversity Professors\nUpon appointment to the rank of University Professor, a faculty member who holds a named and\/or endowed chair may elect to vacate such chair, to make that resource available to another. In such case, the dean of the academic unit in which the faculty member is based may recommend to the Provost, for recommendation to the President, that an honorific name be added to the University Professor title.\nAppropriate names for this circumstance include the options described in section III(c), above, and the names of prior university board chairs, prior university presidents, and the spouses of prior university presidents, provided that the individual (or the spouse of the individual) to be honored is deceased or has been retired from the position for at least five years.\nDeans may also use expendable funds, provided there are no applicable restrictions on such funds, to provide discretionary funds to University Professors who vacate endowed chairs.\n\nMiscellaneous Matters\nAcademic and administrative leaders who wish to name chairs in honor of CMU faculty or staff members who are more recently deceased or retired, or whose retirement is imminent, may do so through fundraising efforts, the plans for which should be approved through the Vice President for University Advancement.\nThe first step in creating an Institutional Chair is for the proposing academic or administrative leader to consult with the Provost, including providing documentation on the credentials of the intended chair recipient, the rationale for the proposed name, and the funding source or fundraising plan.\nThe university recognizes that there presently exist endowed funds to support faculty chairs that do not meet the university endowment minimums. Nothing in this Policy should be construed to prevent the use of these funds for their current purpose. Furthermore, nothing in this Policy should be construed to prevent the consolidation of these funds to form new endowed chair funds, provided that such consolidation does not violate an applicable gift agreement, and that the Provost approves any such consolidation if the aggregate amount of the consolidated funds is less than the applicable university endowment minimum in effect at that time.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It appears in the current issue of the Faculty Handbook. This policy was most recently updated on October 23, 2009.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Provost. Questions about policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\nAppointment and Tenure Policy Teaching Track Appointments  Librarian and Archivist Appointments Special Faculty Appointments Policy on Faculty Consulting\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept and Scope\nAmong the full-time professional positions in research at Carnegie Mellon University that are fully supported from sources external to the university, it is proper to make particular provision for those that most clearly resemble regular faculty positions in regard to responsibility in designing, carrying out and managing research -- including service as principal investigator when appropriate -- quality of publications, supervision of research students, recognition inside and outside of the university, professional activities and active participation in the continuing effort to improve departments, colleges and the university. The main distinction between this group of positions and the regular faculty, stemming from the external nature of the sources of funding and the constraints these impose, is that these positions do not carry eligibility for tenure. Moreover, holders of these positions are not generally obligated to teach regular courses; a more intensive participation is expected of them, however, in the management of research projects.\nThe holders of the positions thus distinguished shall be called, for the purposes of this policy, the research faculty.\nThe breadth of responsibilities in initiating, carrying out, and managing research and in performing their other academic activities distinguishes the research faculty from other professional positions in research, also funded from external sources, that call for qualified persons to perform more specific professional duties, normally pertaining to a specified research project and its management. These latter positions calling for more limited initiative and breadth, shall continue to be subject to the provisions of the Policy on Special Faculty Appointments (appointments of category (B) under that policy), as shall those of an ultimately non-renewable, post-doctoral or visiting nature (category (A) under the same policy).\nThe similarity of the required involvement of the research faculty and the regular faculty in providing the basis for the university's quality and legitimate reputation carries with it: (1) the obligation to scrutinize the appointments and reappointments to research faculty positions with the same care and with the same fundamental principles and procedures as those pertaining to the regular faculty (the eligibility for tenure excepted), including evaluation at the university-wide level; (2) the requirement that all research faculty positions be established in academic departments or the Robotics Institute; and (3) the conferring on the research faculty of the same benefits as on the regular faculty, as specified herein.\nThe research faculty, within the meaning of this policy, consists of persons with the ranks of Assistant Research Professor, Associate Research Professor, and Research Professor. These designations are specific to research faculty positions, and may not be used for any other positions in the university. For the purpose of the application of pertinent provisions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy, as specified below, these ranks shall be regarded as equivalent to those of assistant professor, associate professor, and professor, respectively. The holders of these ranks shall enjoy the same faculty benefits and perquisites as do the holders of equivalent ranks in the regular faculty, viz., those specified in the section on Faculty Benefits in the Faculty Handbook.\nAppointments\nAll research faculty positions shall be established in academic departments or the Robotics Institute. The making of every apppointment in the research faculty (including reappointment, with or without promotion, whether preceded by an evaluation or not), and the specification of its term and compensation require a proposal by the head of the department, a recommendation by the dean, and the approval of the president, who may delegate this function to a provost. The department head's proposal shall specify the manner of funding, whether from resources administered by the department or not, and the president or his designee shall not approve an appointment unless he is satisfied that appropriate funding will be available during the entire term of the appointment and reasonably satisfied that it will continue to be available through the term in which the next evaluation would be required. The president or his designee shall also review every decision to let an appointment (other than a terminal appointment required to satisfy the provisions of this policy for timely notice) lapse at the expiration of its term.\nEvery appointment (including reappointment, with or without promotion) to a position in the research faculty shall be for a term of one year (with the exception of a terminal appointment, as mentioned). In the rank of Assistant Research Professor, no reappointment without promotion (other than a terminal appointment) may be made if it would extend the holding of that rank beyond six years. All reappointments and promotions in the research faculty are subject to the substantive and procedural provisions of this policy.\nWhen an appointment or reappointment (with or without promotion) is made, it is the responsibility of the department head, the dean, and the provost to ensure that the appointee is given clear and full information in writing concerning the terms, functions, and duties of the appointment, including the applicable university and college policies. No oral commitments supplementing written information shall be made or recognized.\nDuring the term of their appointment, holders of research faculty positions are subject to, and protected by, the same university policies concerning academic freedom and dismissal for cause as are regular but untenured faculty members.\nReappointment and promotion in the research faculty are governed by the contributions the candidate has made or may be expected to make to the university's excellence, as well as by the maintenance of the funded research program under which the appointment was made or its replacement by an appropriate substitute program. All decisions on promotion, as well as the other decisions on reappointment described below, shall therefore be preceded by a full and thorough evaluation, to be carried out according to the criteria and procedures specified in this policy. A decision to promote may be made at any time during a term of appointment, and the consequent appointment at the higher rank, if accepted, shall supersede the current term.\nA decision on a reappointment in the same rank shall necessarily be based on an evaluation, as referred to above, whenever the reappointment would first extend the term beyond a) three years from an original appointment in that rank; or b) in the rank of Associate Research Professor, three years from promotion to this rank or six years from the reappointment in this rank following the latest evaluation; or c) in the rank of Research Professor, six years from promotion to this rank, or from the reappointment to this rank following the latest evaluation.\nWhen the decision on a reappointment does not require an evaluation under the preceding provisions, a decision to let the appointment (other than a terminal appointment) lapse at the expiration of its term may be made only for reasons of unavailability of funding from the research program under which the appointment was made or from an appropriate substitute program.\nTimely notice shall be given of every decision not to reappoint a member of the research faculty or to let an appointment (other than a terminal appointment) lapse. Notice is timely if given one year before the expiration of the term of appointment. In order to comply with this provision, it may be necessary to extend a term by an additional appointment of up to one year, designated as a terminal appointment, the decision not to reappoint or to let the appointment lapse nothwithstanding.\nEvaluation\nIntroduction\nEvaluation for appointment, reappointment, and promotion in the research faculty is aimed at determining the contributions the candidate has made and may be expected to make to the university's excellence. All involved should recognize that the final decision resulting from the evaluation is partly subjective. Each affirmative decision is an indication to the individual that the faculty and the administration feel that the candidate's overall progress to that point has been outstanding. Each appointment, reappointment, or promotion does not, however, guarantee future reappointments or promotions. In addition, those qualified for advancement may be denied reappointment or promotion because of the unavailability of suitable funding or, following evaluation, because their talents and interests do not sufficiently fulfill the needs and promote the goals and priorities of the university.\nCriteria\nThe criteria for evaluation are primarily those in the category of research, scholarly or artistic activities. The specific designation of activities which relate to these general criteria may vary among different colleges and schools of the university, each in accordance with its promotion document. The level of competence and achievement in this category required for appointment, reappointment, or promotion at the ranks of Associate Research Professor and Research Professor is descibed below.\nResearch, scholarly or artistic activities are those which lead to the production of new knowledge; to increased problem-solving capabilities, including such activities as design and analysis; to original critical or historical theory and interpretation; or to the production of art or artistic performance.\nTo be promoted, a research faculty member must also demonstrate competence in teaching and educational activities, i.e., in disseminating the knowledge of his or her field. Typically this will be accomplished by supervising graduate and post-doctoral research, development of educational programs and educational publications. If a research faculty member has accepted teaching assignments, then the teaching performance in these assignments must be evaluated in reappointment or promotion actions.\nResearch faculty members may also carry on professional activities that should be considered for evaluation: e.g., professional practice, consulting, public service, service in technical and professional societies and associations, and editorial work on professional journals. Insofar as such activities either contribute to or are an extension of: teaching and educational activities; or research, scholarly, or artistic activities; they should be considered as they are applicable under those two categories.\nIn addition to all of the above, it is expected that each research faculty member, just as every faculty member, will make his or her contribution to the campus, such as service on committees, participation in campus activities, etc.\nA candidate for initial appointment or promotion to the rank of Research Professor should be very well established in his or her field. The candidate should be a recognized leader with outstanding contributions and a national or international reputation. Evaluation for reappointment at this rank should confirm continued growth in leadership and reputation. An evaluation of reappointment in the rank of Associate Research Professor should show that the leadership and reputation required for the rank of Research Professor are at least firmly in the process of becoming established. A candidate for initial appointment or promotion to the rank of Associate Research Professor should have a record of accomplishment indicating a clear promise of leadership that in due time will be sufficiently established to deserve promotion to the rank of Research Professor.\nProcedures and Other Provisions\nAll provisions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University shall be applicable mutatis mutandis to the research faculty, with the exception of those that refer to the granting of tenure, those that describe criteria for evaluation, and any others that conflict with the provisions of the present policy. In case of conflict, the provisions of the present policy shall prevail.\nIn the process of evaluation of candidates for reappointment or promotion in the research faculty, as well as for initial appointment to the rank of Associate Research Professor or Research Professor, the cognizant university committee shall be:\n\nthe University Committee on Non-Tenured Appointments, for all evaluations for reappointment at the rank of Assistant Research Professor and for initial appointment or promotion to the rank of Associate Research Professor;\nthe University Committee on Tenured Appointments for all evaluations for reappointment at the rank of Associate Research Professor and for initial appointment or promotion to, or reappointment at, the rank of Research Professor.\n\nEach college or school desiring to have members of the research faculty shall promptly incorporate into its promotion and tenure document the appropriate provisions, which shall conform to the provisions of this policy, but shall otherwise agree as closely as possible, within the characteristics of the research faculty, to the document's provisions regarding regular faculty. In particular, research faculty candidates for reappointment or promotion must be evaluated at the college level by the same committee(s) evaluating regular faculty candidates.

It was revised and approved by the President's Council on February 11, 2000. This information is current as of August 13, 2014.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Vice President for Operations. General questions concerning this policy or its intent should be directed to the Benefits Office, ext. 8-2047. Specific questions about an individual's PTO should be directed to her or his supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\n\nTime Off and Leaves, Benefits Programs\n\n\n\n\nFull-time Staff\nThe Paid Time Off Policy provides regular, full-time staff members with an entitlement of days away from work with pay. Paid Time Off (PTO) days may be used for vacation, personal time, illness or time off to care for dependents. PTO must be scheduled in advance and approved by your supervisor, except in cases of illness or emergency. If an employee takes PTO without prior approval for medical or emergency reasons, the university reserves the right to require medical or other documentation of the reasons given for the unapproved PTO. The PTO Policy does not cover scheduled university holidays, floating holidays, time off for jury duty or bereavement leave. Questions about PTO earned and used should be referred to your supervisor.\nPaid Time Off is earned on an employment year basis and is earned on the first day of each month following your date of employment. Paid Time Off is based on the following schedule:\n\n\n\n\nCompleted Years of Employment:\n\n\nPaid Time Off:\n\n\n\n\nUp to and including year 3\n\n\n17 days (1.42 days per month)\n\n\n\n\nBeginning year 4\n\n\n20 days (1.67 days per month)\n\n\n\n\nBeginning year 8\n\n\n25 days (2.08 days per month)\n\n\n\n\nBeginning year 16\n\n\n30 days (2.50 days per month)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Staff members employed at the time the Paid Time Off Policy was implemented in 1990 should review the section of this policy called \"Staff Hired Prior to July 1, 1990,\" below.\nDuring your first year of employment, PTO is earned at a rate of one-twelfth of 17 days, or 1.42 days per month. Time off may only be used as it is earned, except in the case of illness. In no instance may a supervisor permit a staff member to take more than five (5) days unearned PTO.\u00a0PTO days are not earned during any leaves of absence. If an employee is on a leave of absence the first day of the month, PTO will not accrue for that month. \u00a0An employee will resume earning and accruing PTO on the first day of the month following the employee\u2019s return to work. \u00a0If an employee returns to work on the first day of the month, the employee will resume earning PTO on that day.\nAfter your first employment anniversary, you may schedule Paid Time Off at any time during your employment year. Whenever possible, PTO should be scheduled in full-day or half-day increments. \u00a0However, in non-medical and non-emergency cases in which the supervisor has granted prior approval, or in cases of medical necessity or emergency where obtaining prior approval is not possible, employees may schedule time in one-hour increments. Departments have discretion to prohibit the use of PTO in one-hour increments due to business necessity. \u00a0\nPTO may not be used to receive pay in excess of wages earned for a normal work day and PTO is not counted for purposes of calculating overtime pay. The total amount of hours worked plus hours taken as PTO in a single day may not exceed the number of hours in an employee\u2019s normal daily work schedule.\nPTO days are not earned during part-time employment. However, part-time employees who are subsequently hired into a full-time, benefits-eligible position may count each year in which they have worked 1,000 hours or more while part-time as a year of service on the PTO accrual schedule.\u00a0\nCarryover of Paid Time Off\nEarned, unused PTO may be carried over into the next year but the number of days carried over may not exceed your entitlement for the new anniversary year. Example:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPTO Entitlement Carryover\n\n\nUsed\n\n\nUnused\n\n\nPTO Actual Carryover\n\n\n\n\n1st Year\n\n\n17\n\n\n13\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n2nd Year\n\n\n17+4=21\n\n\n15\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n3rd Year\n\n\n17+6=23\n\n\n10\n\n\n13\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n4th Year\n\n\n20+13=33\n\n\n13\n\n\n20\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n5th Year\n\n\n20+20=40\n\n\n19\n\n\n21\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of PTO days carried over from one year to the next may not exceed your entitlement for the new anniversary year; days not used or carried over may be added to your sick day bank and used as days at 100% pay (Reserve Sick Days) in lieu of benefits through the Short Term Disability Plan. You must have an approved STD claim in order to use Reserve Sick Days. (A maximum of 130 Reserve Sick Days may be banked.)\nPaid Time Off at Termination\nTerminating employees will be paid either for their earned but unused PTO or their annual entitlement, whichever is less. Unused PTO carried over will be used in this calculation.\nExamples:\n\nA terminating employee with two years and six months of service who has used no PTO days during the current employment year and who has two unused days of PTO carried over from the previous year will be entitled to payment of 10.5 days - 8.5 days earned in the current year plus two carried over. (1.42 X 6 + 2 = 10.5)\nA terminating employee with four years and ten months of service who has used no PTO days during the current employment year and who has six unused days of PTO carried over from the previous year will be paid for 20 days of PTO - the current annual entitlement. (1.67 X 10 + 6 = 22.7 = 20 days annual entitlement.)\n\nIf you have used all of your PTO entitlement for the employment year and terminate your employment before you have earned all the PTO you have taken, payment for the unearned days will be deducted in the computation of your final paycheck.\nThe university does not make payment for unused PTO to employees who are terminated for the violation of university rules and\/or regulations, to employees who resign without appropriate notice as described under Voluntary Termination in the Staff Handbook, to employees who resign or terminate employment during the initial provisional period, or to the beneficiaries of employees who die while employed at the university. In the latter case, the Month-After-Death Benefit is provided. (Unused Reserve Sick Days are not paid at termination.) \u00a0An employee cannot use PTO on the last day of employment. \u00a0Unless on an approved leave of absence, an employee must be actively working on the date employment ends.\nWhen an employee\u2019s status changes from full-time to part-time, the employee will be paid for his or her earned unused PTO days or annual entitlement, whichever is less.\u00a0An emergency or unexpected work requirement might cause you to forego scheduled Paid Time Off already approved by your supervisor. When such an event means that you cannot carry over PTO to which you would have been entitled if you had taken your scheduled Paid Time Off, special arrangements may be made by your department head and should be confirmed in writing. The agreement may provide for Paid Time Off to be carried forward or some other arrangement appropriate to the circumstances.\nStaff members hired before July 1, 1990\nStaff members hired before July 1, 1990 continued to receive their current allocation of vacation days plus sick days as PTO days, as shown on the Transitional Schedule*. A staff member continued to earn that number of days each year until his\/her completed years of employment put the staff member at a step on the Paid Time Off Schedule.**\nFor example, if you had completed five years of service and were in your sixth year of employment, you would earn 25 PTO days (15 vacation and 10 sick) under the Transitional Schedule. In the seventh year of employment, you would also earn 25 PTO days. Upon completing seven years of employment, in your eighth year, you would be at the \"beginning year 8\" step in the PTO schedule (25 days per year).

Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of Sponsored Research,\u00a0ext. 8-7291. For the list of persons authorized to sign contracts for Carnegie Mellon see the policy on Authorized Signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\nAuthorized Signatures\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nSponsored research is an important part of the mission of the university and accounts for a significant portion of the university's expenditures in a given year. The large amount of research that is supported by government, industry and foundations brings with it a myriad of constantly changing legal, financial and administrative requirements which must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of all these factors, it is important that all proposals, contracts and agreements related to research activities be reviewed centrally to ensure compliance with government regulations and university policies.\nSignatures and Approvals\nIn general, research proposals require two sets of signatures: those required by the funding organization and those required by Carnegie Mellon. No proposal should be sent out of the university without the appropriate signatures.\nAll research proposals to the government and to corporations should be circulated internally and should be accompanied by a Carnegie Mellon Proposal Routing and Sign-off Sheet. The sign-off sheet ensures that everyone involved in the process has had the opportunity to review the proposal.\nThe following signatures are required on the sign-off sheet:\n\nPrincipal investigators: their signatures state that they understand their commitments to the project and agree to meet their obligations as set forth in the proposal.\nDeans and the department heads: their signatures attest that they support the proposal and that all matters relating to space, facilities and personnel can be resolved within the department and the college. In instances of joint proposals, signatures from all department heads and deans are required.\nSignatures from the Office of Sponsored Research and Provost's Office indicate that the proposal and the budget have been reviewed and that they meet the requirements of both the university and the potential sponsor.\n\nResearch proposals to foundations - whether initiated within the college or the Development Office - must also be reviewed and signed by the Provost's Office.\nNegotiation of the Award\nAfter an award is made to the university, the Office of Sponsored Research will enter into sponsored research or contract negotiations. The principal investigator will be responsible for negotiating technical aspects of the agreement. The remainder of the negotiations will be the responsibility of the Office of Sponsored Research or the Office of the Associate Provost for Research and Academic Administration. All research agreements must be signed by either the provost or the associate provost for research and academic administration.

It was most recently updated on April 14, 1998.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Provost. General questions about Policy content should be directed to the University Registrar's Office, 412-268-7404.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\nGuidelines for Cross-College and University Registration Grading Policies\n\n\n\n \nPolicy Statement\nThe Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses, originally dated January 13, 1993, and approved by the Committee on Educational Programs and Student and Faculty Affairs states:\n\"Carnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit through a cross-registration program and through the receipt of transfer credit from other accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include information on such courses as follows:\nCarnegie Mellon courses and courses taken through the university's cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grade. Such courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer credit only if their college's and department's policies allow this.)\nDefinitions\nA Carnegie Mellon course is one conducted under Carnegie Mellon University regulations regarding course content and grading and taught by faculty under the supervision of a Carnegie Mellon academic unit. Courses taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty on the Carnegie Mellon campus qualify. Courses that are part of the regular offerings of other universities do not qualify, unless faculty at the other universities receive appointments at Carnegie Mellon and handle Carnegie Mellon students under Carnegie Mellon academic regulations.\nCourses offered for cross-registration are those taken under the PCHE (Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education) agreement during the regular academic year.\"\nOnly official and final college or university transcripts will be accepted for the awarding of transfer credit. Grade reports, letters and the like are not acceptable. It is the responsibility of Enrollment Services and Admission to verify official transcripts. Official transcripts for the awarding of transfer credit will reside in the student's permanent university academic folder in Enrollment Services.\nIt is the responsibility of each academic department to review and establish transfer course credit for their degree-seeking students.\nTransfer Credit Evaluation Procedure\nExternal Transfer Students\nExternal applicants applying for transfer to Carnegie Mellon will arrange for submission of:\n\nofficial transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission as part of the admission process,\nofficial, final transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission once they are admitted and prior to their beginning coursework at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nAs part of the admission process, Admission will verify the official final transcripts, and then send them to the appropriate academic unit responsible for college\/department acceptance decisions. Each unit will be responsible for student's review of transfer credit and the establishment of transfer course credit for each individual student.\nCurrent Students\nCurrent Carnegie Mellon students taking courses at other accredited institutions (colleges and universities), during either summer semesters or as part of exchange programs or other departmentally approved programs, or while on leave from Carnegie Mellon, must arrange for the submission of official final transcripts to Enrollment Services.\nUpon receipt, Enrollment Services will verify these official transcripts and send a copy of the transcript to the appropriate academic unit responsible for that student's college\/department transfer credit decisions. The official transcript will reside in the student's university academic folder in Enrollment Services. Each unit will be responsible for its students' transfer credit review and the establishment of transfer course credit for each individual student. Should a unit receive the official transcript, it must be sent immediately to Enrollment Services.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

These policies appear in the current issue of the Faculty Handbook. See also the Faculty Parental Leave Policy.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Provost. Questions about policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684. Questions about a specific leave should be directed to your department head or dean. For benefits available during leave, contact the Benefits Office at ext. 8-2049.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\nFaculty Parental Leave Policy Public Service Leaves Family Medical Leave\n\n\nRELATED FORMS:\n\nOnline forms can be found on the Faculty Leaves page of the Vice Provost for Faculty website.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Leaves\nLeaves for personal circumstances are granted on either a half-time or a full-time basis. For example, a faculty member might request such leave to care for an ill, elderly parent. Also, such leave can be granted to assist in child care.\nBenefits Provided to Faculty on Full-time Leaves\nNormally, full-time leaves are unpaid by the university. When on full-time leave, a faculty member may continue only the following benefits: group life, health, dental and vision insurance. These benefits are available only if the faculty member pays the COBRA cost of the benefit coverage.\nBenefits Provided to Faculty on Half-time Leaves\nFaculty members who are on half-time leave can continue to participate in the university's health insurance plan by paying the part-time rate. Dental and\/or vision coverage can be continued as long as the faculty member pays the COBRA cost of these coverages. Life insurance may also continue in the amount equal to the coverage level in effect prior to the leave of absence. The university continues its contribution for basic life insurance, and faculty members who have supplemental life insurance would continue to pay the full cost of the supplemental coverage.\nRetirement contributions will continue, based on the salary paid by the university during the period of the leave.\nEligibility for tuition benefits for faculty members themselves continues for the duration of the leave for one course per semester. Eligibility for tuition benefits for dependents terminates at the end of the academic term following the effective date of the leave.\nParticipation in the Short-Term Disability and Long-Term Disability Benefits Programs terminates on the effective date of the leave.\nThe Child Care Center 25% discount and sliding scale benefit terminates at the end of the month in which the leave begins.\nFamily Leave Policy\nThis policy provides options to which eligible faculty are entitled. Application for any of these options should be made with a faculty member's department head and dean and must be approved by the provost.\nEligibility for Family Leave\nTo be eligible for family leave, a faculty member must, during the period of the leave, be the primary care-giver for a child or other dependent. The definition of \"primary care-giver\" will vary across family situations but the individual must have exclusive care responsibility for a dependent for a significant fraction of the day during the regular work week. A faculty member who has dependent care assistance for more than 30 hours per week on average, for instance, would not generally qualify as primary care-giver. Within these guidelines, the determination of whether a faculty member is a primary care-giver is determined by the provost, upon the recommendation of the department head or dean.\nFaculty members should apply for family leave as early as possible, generally at least one semester in advance. In some cases the need for family leave cannot be anticipated. In these cases, all parties should make a good-faith effort to resolve the situation to the parties' mutual satisfaction.\nFaculty who meet the primary care-giver criterion are eligible for family leave subject to approval by the provost provided two years have elapsed since the last use, if any, of such leave.\nCharacterization of Family Leaves\nA family leave may extend up to one year. The term for family leave is ordinarily one semester or one year.\nFaculty on \"full\" family leave have no teaching, research or administrative duties and receive no salary. Faculty on \"partial\" family leave have a reduced workload and receive a comparable reduction in salary (e.g., half-time teaching and other duties would be associated with half of the faculty member's regular salary).\nBenefits for faculty on full or partial leave are specified in the university's benefits policy. Faculty on full or partial family leave should schedule an appointment with the Benefits Office to discuss the nature of benefits available during the leave.\nTenure Clock\nUntenured faculty members who are eligible for family leave, whether such leave is taken or not, are entitled to have the corresponding period fully or partially excluded, at their discretion, from current service for the purpose of determining the tenure decision deadline (i.e., they can \"delay the tenure clock\"), subject to the constraint that the aggregate exclusion for such family reasons may not exceed two years. To make any such exclusion effective, it has to be requested by the faculty member no later than the date on which the eligibility for family leave ends.\nOther Family Leave Options\nThe policy is not intended to preclude other arrangements for family leave. Any such arrangements require the mutual consent of the faculty member, the relevant department head or dean, and the provost, and are subject to the relevant provisions of the Promotion and Tenure Policy, the Tenure Clock and Family Leave section of this policy, and the university's benefits policies.\nProfessional Leaves\nIt is important for the university to have a leave policy to enable faculty to develop themselves professionally. Such a policy will be particularly important during the 1990s when Carnegie Mellon is likely to have fewer new members added to the faculty. Two policies concerning professional faculty leaves are outlined below: The first concerns leaves which are supported in large part by the university; the second concerns leaves which are supported wholly by outside funds.\nUniversity-supported Leaves\nThe university-supported leaves will be financed by departments and colleges through teaching load exchanges or through the utilization of funds at their disposal, by as much outside money as faculty members can raise, supplemented by budgeted university funds which are administered, individually, by each dean solely for support of professional leaves.\nThe important criterion for awarding leaves will be faculty development. Thus, the quality of the project proposed and the impact that it will have on the faculty member's development are most important in the final decision to grant a leave.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a university-supported leave is to permit a faculty member to devote himself\/herself to a creative activity that will contribute to his\/her professional stature as a scholar, teacher and\/or artist and to his\/her value to Carnegie Mellon.\nLeaves will be granted on the merits of the projects to be undertaken.\nEligibility\nA faculty member of the rank of professor, associate professor or assistant professor is eligible to apply for leave after six years of service to Carnegie Mellon. When a faculty member has been on a Carnegie Mellon-supported leave, he\/she will become eligible to apply again after six more years of service.\nTerms of the Leave\n\nWhen a leave is granted with all financial support coming from Carnegie Mellon, the grant will consist of half salary for an academic year or full salary for one semester.\nIt is expected that faculty members will apply to other agencies (Fulbright, Guggenheim, National Science Foundation, etc.) for leave support. Carnegie Mellon funds can be applied to supplement funds from other sources when the regulations of these agencies permit. Supplemental funds will not be approved in such amounts that the total would exceed the applicant's salary, plus reasonable travel expenses, for the period of the leave. Faculty members are encouraged to seek assistance from the department heads, deans, vice presidents and development office in applying to outside agencies.\nIn addition, if benefits are not available through the host institution, Carnegie Mellon will continue all benefits for a faculty member based on the faculty member's full salary for that academic year. The college or department would pay the fringe rate on the faculty member's full salary. (The faculty member will include the Carnegie Mellon fringe rate in his\/her account of outside support needed. The faculty member will arrange for reimbursement to the college or department to the extent that the fringe rate is provided by the outside agency.)\nBefore the leave becomes effective, the applicant's dean and department head will determine and inform the applicant whether the leave period is or is not to be counted against the term of the academic appointment if the applicant does not hold indefinite tenure.\nA faculty member who receives a leave supported by Carnegie Mellon funds will be required to make a commitment to return to Carnegie Mellon for one year and, if he\/she decides not to return, to reimburse Carnegie Mellon for the full amount of the leave grant made to him\/her by Carnegie Mellon.\n\nProcedure\n\nEligible faculty member submits application (available from deans and department heads), giving particulars of his\/her proposal to department head by December 15.\nDepartment head forwards the application and a written comment to the dean.\nDean decides how the university funds, budgeted exclusively for support of professional leaves, are to be awarded within that college. The dean's recommendations are forwarded to the provost by January 1.\nThe provost will then discuss with the deans and department heads the arrangements for financing the leaves. The number of leaves to be granted will depend on the financial arrangements which are finally made.\nNotification of approved leaves will be made by March 1.\n\nProfessional Leaves Supported by Outside Funds\nThe university encourages leaves of absence supported by outside funds. In general, such leaves will be granted for the purpose of professional development by the faculty member, but such purposes as service to the government, to corporations and to foundations will also be recognized and encouraged.\nEligibility\nA faculty member of the rank of professor, associate professor or assistant professor is eligible to apply for a leave supported by outside funds at any time. Normally, such leaves will not be granted more often than once in four years. The period spent on such a leave will not be counted towards the six-year service period required for university-supported leaves.\nTerms of the Leave\n\nLeaves will ordinarily be granted for a one-year period (or less). Renewal for a second year can be requested.\nLeaves will not extend beyond two years. Exceptions to this rule may be made for certain kinds of government service (i.e., cabinet or agency appointments).\nBenefits will ordinarily be paid by the outside funding agency. If benefits are not available through the host institution, Carnegie Mellon will continue all benefits for a faculty member based on the faculty member's full salary for that academic year. The college or department would pay the fringe rate on the faculty member's full salary. (The faculty member will include the Carnegie Mellon fringe rate in his\/her account of outside support needed. The faculty member will arrange for reimbursement to the college or department to the extent that the fringe rate is provided by the outside agency.)\n\nProcedure\n\nA faculty member is to submit an application for a leave supported by outside funds to the department head or dean by December 15 or earlier. Applications which are submitted after December 15 may be rejected if a replacement cannot be obtained for the following year.\nThe approved application should be forwarded by the dean to the provost, who will send a letter of approval by January 15.\n\u00a0  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Students choosing to take a leave of absence must first contact their department advisor to discuss their plans while on leave to work out any conditions that may be necessary for a smooth return to Carnegie Mellon.  A student may leave Carnegie Mellon by either withdrawing from the university (this means leaving the university with no intention of returning) or by taking a leave of absence (this means leaving the university temporarily, with the firm and stated intention of returning).  A Leave of Absence Form must be completed by all students requesting a leave of absence. A Withdrawal Form must be completed by all students who are withdrawing. Notifying instructors or no longer attending classes does not complete the process. Forms are available on The HUB web site. Not completing the leave form results in tuition being charged to midpoint of the semester or the last date the student attended an academically-related activity such as an exam, tutorial or study group, or the last day a student turned in a class assignment.  Students are required to fill out all information on the form, including all comment sections relating to reasons for their leave of absence. After completion of the form, students must take it to their home department and dean's office for appropriate signatures. The process of taking a leave will not be complete until all necessary signatures are on the leave form. Under certain circumstances, students may also need the Dean of Student Affairs to sign off on the leave form. International students who are here on a F1 or J1 visa must consult the Office of International Education for information on possible visa implications prior to going on leave.  Students on leave are not permitted to live in university housing, attend classes or maintain employment as students at Carnegie Mellon while their leave is in effect.  Doctoral candidates in ABD (All But Dissertation) status who wish to take a leave of absence should refer to the Doctoral Student Status policy.  Leaves during the academic semester will take effect as of the date signed by the student's dean. After the Leave of Absence or Withdrawal Form is received by the University's Registrar's Office, it will be reviewed for the appropriate tuition refunds (see Enrollment Services: Tuition and Fees Adjustment Policy) and grade implications. The recording of student courses and grades for taking a leave in a semester follows the deadlines for semester or mini courses, as follows:\n\nOn or before the university deadline to drop classes with W (withdrawal) grades: all courses or grades are removed.\n\n\nAfter the university deadline to drop classes but before the last day of classes: W (withdrawal) grades will be assigned to all classes. (W grades apply to all undergraduate students, and graduate students in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the Mellon College of Science or the Tepper School of Business.)\n\n\nAfter the last day of classes: Permanent grades assigned by the instructor will be recorded.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Pursuing this mission includes engagement, outreach, and service to the community. In particular, Carnegie Mellon endeavors to support improvements in early childhood education, primary and secondary education, including pre-college, through research, education, recreation, and community service.\u00a0 These endeavors also enhance the professional and personal growth of Carnegie Mellon students. This engagement with the broader community necessarily involves interaction with minor children (under the age of 18). Carnegie Mellon is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all minors involved in any programs or activities conducted on university premises, as well as any off-campus programs or activities sponsored by the university. This Policy sets forth the university\u2019s legal obligations, requirements for and the expectations of faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers who operate and\/or participate in such programs. The purpose of this Policy is to ensure the safety and well-being of minors while setting high standards to encourage the pursuit of excellence in our engagement, outreach, and service to the community. All members of the Carnegie Mellon community, including faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers, are expected to act in accordance with this policy.\nThis policy describes three separate and independent requirements:\u00a0\n\nFirst, in Section II, it describes a \u201cProgram Registration\u201d requirement which will allow the university to ensure that programs involving minors satisfy the requirements of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, as well as other best practices related to health, safety, program operation, parental permission, risk management, etc.\nSecond, in Section III, the Policy sets forth the requirements for background certifications that are required by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law Act when working with minors. These requirements are independent of the program registration requirements in Section II. Before working with minors, please make sure of your obligations under both Sections II and III.\nThird, in Section IV, the Policy sets forth the requirements for the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.\n\nI. Definitions\n\nThe terms \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cminor child\u201d are defined as any individual less than eighteen (18) years of age.*\n\u201cMatriculated Student\u201d is defined as a student who is enrolled at Carnegie Mellon and pursuing a program of study that results in a postsecondary credential, such as a certificate, diploma or degree.*\u00a0\n\u201cSchool Employee\u201d is defined as an individual who is employed by Carnegie Mellon or who provides a program, activity or service sponsored by Carnegie Mellon. This includes any faculty member, staff member or student-employee.*\n\"Responsible Individual\" is defined as the individual designated by a program or activity involving minors who is responsible for the administration of the program and compliance with this Policy. Depending on the nature of the program or activity involving minors, the responsible individual may be a faculty member, staff member, student, contractor, volunteer or a third-party.\nFor purpose of Section II of this Policy, \"Programs and Activities Involving Minors\" is defined as any program, event, or activity involving one or more individuals under the age of 18 that is either:\nSponsored, funded and\/or operated by any Carnegie Mellon administrative unit, academic unit, or student organization, regardless of location. This includes programs and activities conducted on-campus, off-campus, or remotely via the internet or other means of communication; or\nSponsored, funded and\/or operated by a third-party entity and conducted on university property.\n\nThe definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not include:[ 1]\n\nAcademic courses and related programs or activities, where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students, visiting prospective students and visiting \/ non-degree students. (Note:\u00a0 The University Registrar\u2019s Office monitors non-degree students who are minor children and such students are only permitted to register for a class if the instructor, in his\/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain appropriate background certifications under Pennsylvania law.)\nAny program or activity conducted on University property where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students and\/or visiting prospective students.\nIntercollegiate events where the only minors involved are Matriculated Students or students enrolled at another institution of higher education;\nEvents open to the general public where parents\/guardians are required or expected to provide supervision for their children (e.g. a sporting event or a theater production).\nMinors who are employees of Carnegie Mellon and are paid at least a minimum wage (note: co-workers of employees who are under the age of 18 may be required to obtain background certifications under Pennsylvania Law).[2]\nHuman subjects research studies involving minor children that have been approved by the Institutional Review Board (note: the Office of Research Integrity Compliance will notify the AVPEO of any human subjects research studies involving minors so that there will be no need to separately register).\nRoutine interactions between family and friends.\n\n\nII. Requirements for Programs and Activities Involving Minors\nAll programs and activities involving minors must satisfy the following requirements:\nAll programs must register with the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Educational Outreach (AVPEO) and receive approval prior to engaging in any interactions with minors.\u00a0 The AVPEO will coordinate with each program or activity to develop appropriate procedures and training to ensure the welfare and security of minors who participate in the program:\u00a0 https:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/child-protection.\nThe review process conducted by AVPEO will be based on the unique circumstances of each program and include consideration of the following key factors among others: the nature of the program; the duration of the program; the entity sponsoring the program; the responsible individual(s); the number of participants and age ranges; the number of supervising adults; the facilities to be used; use of overnight accommodations; potential health and safety concerns (e.g. laboratory use, machinery, swimming pools, motor vehicles); transportation; protocols for accidents, injuries and emergencies; health and wellness plans; protocols for drop-off and pick-up; and one-on-one private interactions with minors.\nWritten permission must be obtained from each minor's parent\/guardian prior to the minor's participation in any program administered by Carnegie Mellon and\/or any program administered by a third party on Carnegie Mellon property.\nEach program must identify a responsible individual who will be responsible for the administration of the program and compliance with this policy. Notwithstanding the requirements of and\/or exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or similar laws of other jurisdictions, the responsible individual must have valid background certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or similar laws of the applicable jurisdiction.\nIn addition to background certifications required by law as described in Section III below, each program must ensure that at least one individual who has received certifications under the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law and appropriate training is on-site during the program or activity. That is, even if applicable law does not require any individual in a program to obtain background certifications, at least one individual on-site during the program or activity must have a background certification and appropriate training.\nThe college, department, unit, or student organization sponsoring the program may adopt background certification standards more stringent than the minimum required by law, such that any individuals participating in a program may be required to obtain background certifications even where such certification is not required by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law or other applicable laws.\n\nIII. Background Certification\n\nAll faculty, staff, students, contractors, and volunteers must satisfy the background certification requirements for interacting with minors in the applicable jurisdiction. Specifically, it is the policy of Carnegie Mellon University to comply with the background certification provisions of the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (23 Pa C.S.A. \u00a7 6303 et. seq.), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153 of 2014. Detailed information regarding the requirements of and exceptions to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law is available at www.cmu.edu\/hr\/act-153\/index.html.[3]\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese background certification requirements are separate from the program registration requirements set forth in Section II. Even though a position, activity, or program does not meet the definition of program or activity involving minors requiring registration under Section II, the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (or similar laws in other jurisdictions) may still require background certifications. As noted above, the University Registrar\u2019s Office monitors non-degree students who are minor children and such students are only permitted to register for an undergraduate or graduate class if the instructor, in his\/her sole discretion, is willing and able to obtain appropriate background certifications under Pennsylvania law.\nEvery employee and volunteer who is subject to the background certification requirements of this section has an obligation to notify the university if he\/she is arrested for, or convicted of, any offense prohibited by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law. Notice of arrests or convictions must be provided within seventy-two (72) hours. Notice should be submitted to the immediate supervisor of the employee or volunteer.\nIf the university receives notice of an arrest or conviction for a prohibited offense or has reasonable cause to believe that an employee or volunteer has been arrested or convicted of a prohibited offense, the university will require the employee or volunteer to immediately obtain new background certifications. In such cases, the university may prohibit the individual from working with minor children pending receipt of new background certification.\nIV. Mandatory Reporting\nUnder the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law all school employees are mandatory reporters of child abuse. Volunteers who are responsible for the welfare of a minor or who have direct contact with minors are also Mandatory Reporters.\u00a0\nReports of child abuse must be immediately submitted to both:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Human Resources. Reports may be submitted:\nOrally via the Child Hotline at 1-800-932-0313; or\nElectronically via the website https:\/\/www.compass.state.pa.us\/cwis\/public\/home.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University Officials. Reports may be submitted to:\nYour supervisor, or\nUniversity Police, or\nOffice of General Counsel\n\n\nBy law a mandatory report must be immediately filed if there is reasonable cause to suspect that a minor is the victim of child abuse in the following circumstances:\n\nThe Mandatory Reporter comes into contact with the minor in the course of employment, occupation and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled program, activity, or service;\nThe Mandatory Reporter is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance, or training of the minor, or is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, regularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of a minor;\nA person makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory Reporter that an identifiable minor is the victim of child abuse;\nAn individual fourteen (14) years of age or older makes a specific disclosure to the Mandatory Reporter that the individual has committed child abuse.\n\nMembers of the university community located outside of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are expected to comply with any mandatory reporting laws of the applicable jurisdiction. Questions regarding mandatory reporting requirements in other jurisdictions should be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel.\u00a0\nAdditional information about mandatory reporting laws in Pennsylvania, as well as other jurisdictions is available at http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/ogc\/act_153\/index.html.\n\n\n[1]\u00a0Exclusion from the definition of Programs and Activities Involving Minors does not necessarily exempt individual faculty, staff, students, contractors, volunteers, or other third parties from compliance with the requirements of Section III regarding background certifications. Rather, exclusion from this definition exempts the activity from the registration requirements in Section II.\n\n\n[2] Unpaid internships (where permitted by applicable government regulations and HR guidelines) are not exempt from the definition of Programs & Activities Involving Minors.\n[3] The Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), as amended by Pennsylvania Act 153, requires any University employee who has Direct Contact (as that term is defined under the CPSL) with children under the age of 18 to obtain certain background certifications. However, the CPSL does not apply to University employees whose only interactions with children under the age of 18 are limited to matriculated students and\/or visiting prospective students. As such, most employees of Carnegie Mellon are not required to obtain background certifications in order to perform their job duties. But if an employee\u2019s duties include direct contact with children under the age of 18 who are not matriculated students or visiting prospective students, the employee may be required to obtain background certifications under the CPSL.

This Policy intends to meet the procurement requirements contained in the OMB Uniform Guidance Procurement Standards and applies to all CMU employees and any personnel responsible for the acquisition of goods and services for the university, unless otherwise exempted in accordance with this Policy. This Policy applies to all purchases made from external suppliers and not to Carnegie Mellon University suppliers (e.g., bookstore, computer store or art store). Adherence to this Policy will mitigate risk, ensure compliance to requirements, drive effective procurement processes, and deliver benefits to CMU. Failure to comply with the directives in this Policy are a direct violation of the University Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. This Policy and corresponding policies and manuals have been implemented to meet the procurement requirement contained in Part 200 \u2013 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards Subpart D (2 CFR 200 Subpart D) issued on December 26, 2013 amended on December 19, 2014. Procurement Services (PS) is the single point of contact for all centralized university procurement policies and procedures. Any exception requests and\/or clarifications to this Policy should be directed to PS.\nRoles and Responsibilities\nConsiderable authority is delegated to academic and administrative units to make purchasing decisions. This requires that employees involved at every step of the process take full responsibility for understanding university policies and procedures regarding purchasing, payment and vendor relations. Purchasing decisions are business decisions made on behalf of Carnegie Mellon University and therefore should be made with the utmost consideration for what is in the best interest of the university. 1. Buyer Responsibilities\n\nAbide by this Policy and any related government, sponsor, or university policies, procedures, guidelines and\/or business requirements as applicable.\nComplete required training and all applicable forms, statements and\/or certifications.\nUse the appropriate university purchasing method for procuring goods and\/or services.\nComply with plans on the utilization of small, disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, service disabled veteran-owned and HUB Zone businesses, and preferred suppliers.\nDocument and reconcile purchases in accordance with Carnegie Mellon policies, business requirements and\/or government or sponsor regulations.\nMaintain security of purchasing methods.\nEnsure departmental buyers are aware of budgeted funds prior to making a purchase, and purchases fall in line with allotted funds.\nObtain appropriate approvals and documentation prior to purchase.\nEnsure goods or services are necessary and avoid acquisitions of unnecessary or duplicative items.\nEnsure personal purchases are prohibited and reported promptly to University Audit Services if found.\n\n 2. Department Authorizer Responsibilities\n\nIdentify departmental buyers to procure goods and service on behalf of the university.\nEnsure departmental buyers make the best efforts to utilize small\/disadvantaged businesses and preferred suppliers.\nEnsure departmental buyers meet responsibilities identified in this Policy, and receive required training.\nRetain documentation to support transactions in accordance with university policies, business requirements and\/or government regulations.\nApprove purchases as required and ensure availability of funds from departmental budgets\/grants.\nEnsure personal purchases are prohibited and reported promptly to University Audit Services if found.\nEnsure departmental buyers are aware of budgeted funds prior to making a purchase, and purchases fall in line with allotted funds.\nEnsure goods or services are necessary and avoid acquisitions of unnecessary or duplicative items.\n\n 3. Procurement Services Responsibilities\n\nSet and maintain university\u2019s Purchasing Policy, including any clarifications and approval of exceptions to the Policy.\nProvide a Procurement Manual detailing procedures.\nProvide purchasing and small business utilization training, documentation, tools and forms.\nOversee buyer adherence to the university\u2019s standard of conduct surrounding conflict of interest in procurement.\nEstablish and maintain preferred supplier list, travel program and a strategic sourcing program.\nRegularly reevaluate preferred suppliers for performance, price adherence and customer satisfaction.\nMake efforts to locate, solicit and contract small\/disadvantaged businesses for the preferred supplier program.\nProvide information related to locating all categories of small businesses.\nProvide guidance on the use of the proper method of purchase based on the purchase amount.\nMediate supplier-customer disputes.\nApprove purchase orders as required.\n\nSupplier Preferences\nThere are numerous considerations when selecting a supplier when the university needs to purchase a good or services, including but not limited to, cost, timeframe, quality, relationship with the university, etc. The university has identified the following supplier categories that take these considerations into account:\n\nPreferred Suppliers\nThis designation indicates that the university has negotiated commercial pricing and legal terms and conditions in place with the supplier. Not all suppliers may be considered preferred. This status requires work between the supplier and PS. PS is the only university entity able to authorize and designate a supplier as preferred. Use of a preferred supplier for procurements within the Simplified Acquisition Threshold does not require any further competition and documentation.\nThe use of preferred suppliers has many benefits, including maximizing the best value to the university, ease of ordering, savings due to leveraging volume, improved access to information, and a higher level of service due to the strong commitment the supplier has to the university. Additionally, using a preferred supplier improves productivity and efficiency of departmental personnel by reducing the time used to source bids and negotiate pricing and contractual terms, as the work has already been done by PS.\nPS maintains a list of preferred suppliers in the supplier directory found on the PS website.\nQuestions regarding preferred suppliers and the way a supplier becomes preferred should be directed to PS.\n\nInternal SuppliersThe university has elected to provide the option to purchase certain goods and services through internal suppliers (e.g., bookstore, computer store, facilities management). Administrative and academic units should consider the use of such internal suppliers before looking for an external supplier. Advantages of using internal suppliers may include eliminating the need for POs or PCard transactions and the associated administrative burdens. Transactions with these internal suppliers are not subject to purchasing thresholds established in this Policy, and therefore can be utilized without added sourcing requirements to use an external supplier.\nResponsible SuppliersTo be eligible to receive a university contract, or PO, a supplier must be determined to be a responsible supplier during the bid\/evaluation process. Responsible means the supplier, whether a company or an individual, has appropriate legal authority to do business, a satisfactory record of integrity, appropriate financial, organizational and operational capacity and controls, and acceptable performance on previous governmental and\/or private contracts, if any. Examples of non-responsible suppliers include, but are not limited to, a supplier's history of nonperformance or performance problems on other contracts (public or private) and\/or a record of financial difficulty, business instability, criminal sanctions, civils sanctions and\/or tax delinquency.Buyers should be aware of suppliers who are federally suspended or debarred, and check their Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) clearance via the System for Award Management (formerly the Excluded Parties List System) before engaging a vendor.\nSmall\/Disadvantaged SuppliersAs a recipient of federal funds, Carnegie Mellon has responsibility to utilize small\/disadvantaged business enterprises. Carnegie Mellon has established goals, which can be found in the Procurement Manual, for disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, service disable veteran-owned and HUB Zone business enterprise participation. Awards from government or other sponsoring agencies may mandate different participation goals.\n\nProcurement Thresholds\nProcurement must be conducted in a manner that provides all suppliers the same opportunity to compete openly and fully and Carnegie Mellon must not take any arbitrary actions that would provide suppliers an unfair competitive advantage.\nAll proposals and quotations received will be evaluated based on quality, service, compliance to specifications and price and all awards will be made in the best interest of the university. Any or all proposals may be rejected at the discretion of Carnegie Mellon and will be documented for future reference by PS.\nAny procurement must be accompanied by the proper documentation, and the procurement threshold will dictate the procurement method. Failure to attach the required documentation will result in a rejection of the procurement request, and may be deemed non-compliant with this Policy.\nThe following thresholds apply to competitive sourcing of goods and services at Carnegie Mellon:\n\nMicro-Purchases: $3,000 or less ($2,000 or less for construction awards where the Davis-Bacon Act applies)Competition and\/or cost\/price analysis are not required if the price is considered reasonable by the buyer.\nSmall Purchase\/Simplified Acquisition: $3,001 - $149,999.99 Price and rate quotes must be obtained via informal methods and documented on a Purchasing Checklist & Bid Summary Form from a minimum of two (three or more are recommended) qualified sources to establish competition, if not utilizing a preferred supplier or university internal supplier.\nPreferred Supplier Purchases: $149,999.99 or less No bidding or documentation is required if a preferred supplier is utilized. All support documentation for preferred suppliers is maintained by PS.\nSealed Bids: $150,000 and above (recommended method for construction) Bids must be formally solicited and documented from two (three or more recommended) or more responsible bidders by or in conjunction with PS unless specifically delegated in writing by Procurement Services. A firm fixed price contract is awarded principally based on price to a responsible bidder.\nCompetitive Proposals\/Requests for Proposals (RFP): $150,000 and above Used when a sealed bid is not appropriate or the sealed bid conditions cannot be met, such as the condition to award only based on price to a responsible bidder. RFP are used with competitive proposals, must identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance and be solicited from two or more qualified sources by or in conjunction with PS. Contracts must be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to Carnegie Mellon by scoring the identified evaluation factors.\nNoncompetitive Proposals (i.e., sole-source or single source procurements) Procurement that meets the requirements for competition (above micro-purchase threshold), but a bid or proposal is solicited from only one non-preferred source. Non-competitive proposals are used only if the good or service is available from one source, the need for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation, the government or sponsoring awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes noncompetitive proposals and\/or after solicitation of several sources, competition is determined inadequate.\n\nPurchasing Methods\nThe following are the primary purchasing methods employed by the university. Any method beyond those listed below requires PS approval. All purchases, except for those made with internal suppliers must comply with this Purchasing Policy, the Procurement Manual, the Business and Travel Expense Policy and all other university policies. This Policy outlines the expectation that individuals who have a procurement need will utilize the recommended procurement methods of a PO, PCard or Travel Card to ensure compliance with state, federal, sponsor and institutional purchasing policies and to minimize institutional risk. Any questions regarding the types of items and the method through which they should be purchased should be directed to PS. All procurement exceptions must be approved by PS in advance of transacting a purchase or conducting the applicable university business. Use of any purchasing method for personal purchases may be considered misappropriation of university funds and disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with university policy up to and including the termination of employment.\n\nPurchase Order (PO) A purchase order (PO) is completed and approved through the university financial system and then issued to a supplier indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for the products or services the supplier will provide to Carnegie Mellon. Certain purchases or services (e.g., hazardous materials, live animals, lasers and other radioactive devices), require oversight and regardless of amount, must be placed on a PO. POs may be used for any procurement, but must be accompanied by a contract if for a service. POs should be issued prior to the receipt of goods or services from a vendor. It is imperative to complete a PO prior to the receipt of the invoice to create a legal contract between the supplier and the university and to ensure goods\/services are delivered in accordance to university terms and conditions or an applicable contract. The PO released to the vendor will reference the terms and conditions, which state that payment should not be remitted to any invoice that does not reference a PO number. Even if a contract containing all legal and commercial terms and conditions exists, a PO is required to facilitate billing and proper accounting.\nPurchasing Card (PCard) A credit card issued to authorized employees to make allowable micro-purchases of goods and certain services, if accompanied by a contract, on behalf of the university. PCards are intended to replace small dollar purchase orders. PCard holders are personally responsible for their assigned PCards, must not allow others to use their PCards and should diligently secure the PCard at all times (i.e., guard against fraud and unauthorized use of the PCard).\nTravel Card Department and individual Travel Cards are issued by the university and are designed to simplify and streamline the process of paying for business travel expenses. Business travel charges on the Travel Card are billed to and paid by the university. For faculty and staff who frequently travel in the performance of their business role with the university, individual Travel Cards may be issued via Procurement Services to be used for official university business travel expenses only. Travel Card holders are personally responsible for their assigned Travel Cards, must not allow others to use their Travel Cards and should diligently secure the Travel Card at all times (i.e., guard against fraud and unauthorized use of the Travel Card).\nExpense Reimbursements While not recommended, use of personal funds is allowed for the purchase of goods only when logistical or extenuating circumstances occur that preclude use of a PO or PCard. Due to compliance concerns, the purchase of goods in excess of the micro-purchase threshold of $3,000 with personal funds are prohibited. Professional services may not be procured with personal funds. All purchases made with personal funds shall be submitted in accordance with applicable requirements in accordance with the Business and Travel Expense Policy.\nPetty Cash While not recommended, use of university petty cash is allowed for the purchase of small and\/or nominal goods only when logistical or extenuating circumstances occur that preclude use of a PO or PCard. All petty cash requests must be submitted in accordance with applicable requirements, as detailed in the university Petty Cash Policy. Services may not be procured via petty cash.\n\nPurchasing Ethical Standards\nEthical business standards, as well as adherence to university Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, shall govern all procurement transactions. Infractions of university policy must be reported to PS. Disciplinary action for those violating ethical business standards will be taken in accordance with university policy up to and including the termination of employment.\nConflict of Interest Buyers, department authorizers and members of the university community with procurement responsibilities or the ability to influence purchasing decisions, the negotiation or formation of contracts and\/or the management of ongoing supplier relationships must avoid unethical conduct and conflicts of interest when purchasing goods and services. When members of the university community, associates or their immediate family members have financial interests in a business or are involved in a business as an owner, operator, employee or officer, all parties must be alert to the possibility that a real or perceived conflict of interest may arise. Under no circumstance will individuals review, approve, control or influence purchases for contracts or business relationships where they may personally gain or benefit. This pertains to a contract or business relationship between the university and a business in which the individual or their immediate family member(s), spouse or partner has a financial interest, or when the individual or their immediate family member(s) is an employee of the business and is directly involved with activities pertaining to the university. Government regulations require Carnegie Mellon to have explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of improprieties or conflicts of interest in purchasing. Real, perceived or potential purchasing conflicts of interest must be reported to PS. This Purchasing Policy works in tandem with the Conflict of Interest\/Commitment Policy and Compliance with Financial Conflict of Interest Requirements in Research Policy. Questions regarding actual or perceived conflicts of interest should be referred to PS for evaluation and guidance. Carnegie Mellon's Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form is distributed annually to Carnegie Mellon Buyers for signature by PS.\nPurchasing Code of Ethics In addition to the standards and values established in the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, Carnegie Mellon subscribes to the intent of the National Association of Educational Procurement (NAEP) Code of Ethics. Carnegie Mellon's Buyer Code of Ethics is distributed annually to Carnegie Mellon Buyers.\nAnti-Kickback Clause The Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. 51-58) prohibits any person from: providing or attempting to provide or offering to provide any kickback; soliciting, accepting or attempting to accept any kickback; or including, directly or indirectly, the amount of any kickback in the contract price. The Act imposes criminal and civil penalties on any person who knowingly and willfully engages in the prohibited conduct addressed in the Act [FAR 3.502-2 (b) and (c)]. Carnegie Mellon's Anti-Kickback Clause is distributed annually to Carnegie Mellon Buyers by PS for signature as required by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Carnegie Mellon's cognizant agency.\nSupplier Gratuities and Gifts Gifts of money or cash equivalents cannot be accepted at any time from a supplier or potential supplier. Individuals may only accept unsolicited nominal personal gifts, meals, entertainment and other normal social amenities no greater in aggregate value than $75 per occurrence ($300 total per year) from a single source (individual or business) provided the source is not participating in a competitive bid for university business or is not in negotiations with the university for a contract award. If an unsolicited gift of any value is accompanied with a request by the supplier for preferential treatment, the gift must be immediately returned and PS must be notified. This is inclusive of any subcontractors or sub-tier suppliers.All gifts given in support of an institutional mission must be directed through University Advancement offices in accordance with Gift Acceptance, Counting, and Reporting Policy. Gifts and entertainment can be used to build goodwill between the university and our business partners; however, some gifts and entertainment may conflict with the university's values of integrity and social responsibility. Questions about the value or appropriateness of a gift or invitation, or approval of any exceptions of the requirements noted in this Policy, should be directed to, and reviewed with, an immediate supervisor. Should there be a need for additional assistance to determine the appropriateness of a gift, PS is available to provide support.\n\nProcurement Activities Related to Students\nStaff and faculty are responsible to ensure any student assigned purchasing responsibilities adhere to this Policy. Any violation of these requirements may be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in the university\u2019s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct.\nUse of University Assets\nMembers of the university are required to act in accordance with applicable university procedures regarding the procurement of goods and service and the use and control of tangible and intangible university assets, including confidential and privileged information. Unauthorized use of university assets in connection with any external activity is prohibited. Identification of the university as one\u2019s employer and of one\u2019s position at the university is permitted.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2018 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

In order to be considered for return from leave, a student must first obtain an Application for Return form from The HUB or their academic department. This application requires information from the student regarding the intended semester of return, current address information and information about their leave. This application must be submitted to their home department at least one month prior to the beginning of the semester.\nUndergraduates may return within their same academic department within two years. After two years, students returning in the same academic department are subject to space constraints and academic performance review. Graduate students must negotiate their return with their home department and must follow their department policy.\nThe Application for Return requires approval of the student's academic department and dean. If a student's department chooses to deny the student's Application for Return, the student may appeal to their dean. Any constraints governing the student's eligibility to return will be specified directly on the application by the academic department and\/or dean's office or the Office of Student Affairs.\nStudents who have taken courses elsewhere must submit an official transcript and course descriptions with their Application for Return. Transfer credit approval is determined by the academic department based on course level, performance and appropriateness to the student's curriculum requirements. Credit transfer is subject to college-specific policy. Failure to submit the necessary documents at the time of return will result in denial of transfer credit.\nThe process of returning is not completed until all necessary signatures on the Return form are obtained by the student and until all outstanding bills are paid. Enrollment Services will then notify the appropriate university offices of the student's return.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions about policy content should be directed to Environmental Health and Safety,\u00a0Radiation Safety Office, ext. 8-8182.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nCarnegie Mellon University (Carnegie Mellon) complies with federal regulations to minimize potentially damaging ionizing radiation exposure to the embryos\/fetuses of declared pregnant women working in radiologically restricted areas of the university.\nTo ensure compliance, this policy mandates training for all employees and students who work in radiologically restricted areas regarding the effects of radiation on a developing embryo\/fetus. It also mandates a procedure, to be implemented by the radiation safety officer, for ensuring that the radiation exposure of a woman who officially declares her pregnancy does not exceed the level set by federal regulations.\nInformation and Training\nThe radiation safety officer shall provide training sessions in which all students and employees, including supervisors, who are to work in restricted radiation areas are informed, orally and in writing, about this Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy and about potential radiation and non-radiation effects on a developing embryo\/fetus. At these sessions, attendees are given the opportunity to have questions answered. The radiation safety officer may, at his or her discretion, administer an oral and\/or written exam in order to confirm attendees' understanding of the subject matter.\nThe radiation safety officer obtains from each attendee a signed acknowledgment of understanding of the Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy. No employee or student may enter a radiologically restricted area before attending such a training session and signing such an acknowledgment of understanding.\nAny declared pregnant employee or student who performs work that results in radiation exposure at other, non-Carnegie Mellon University locations is responsible for informing the Radiation Safety Office of those activities.\nDeclaration of Pregnancy\nAny employee or student who works in a radiologically restricted area of the university and determines she is pregnant may officially declare her pregnancy to the radiation safety officer. To be considered an official declaration of pregnancy, this must be in writing and contain the estimated date of conception. An official declaration of pregnancy form can be obtained from the radiation safety officer.\nA pregnant woman has no obligation to officially declare her pregnancy.\nLimiting Exposure\nUpon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, the radiation safety officer shall work with the declared pregnant woman's supervisor to review the work being performed by the declared pregnant woman and determine whether exposure is likely to exceed 500 millirems during the pregnancy and\/or likely to substantially vary from month to month during the pregnancy. If exposure greater than 500 millirems or significant variation is determined to be likely, the radiation safety officer and supervisor shall identify and implement appropriate precautions and engineering controls to limit radiation dose and\/or decrease month-to-month variations.\nThe radiation safety officer shall also, upon receiving an official declaration of pregnancy, complete a dose assessment on the declared pregnant woman, including sending her whole body radiation dosimeter to an approved laboratory for processing, and possibly including bioassay by urinalysis. The radiation safety officer shall communicate to the declared pregnant woman the results of the dose assessment.\nOnce a month, the radiation safety officer shall monitor the external occupational dose to a declared pregnant woman using a whole body radiation dosimeter, unless the radiation safety officer considers it unlikely that the embryo\/fetus will receive, from sources outside the body of the declared pregnant woman, a dose in excess of 100 millirems during the course of the pregnancy.\nThe radiation safety officer shall monitor the occupational intake, by bioassay if necessary, of radioactive material by a declared pregnant woman, unless the radiation safety officer considers it unlikely that the declared pregnant woman will receive a \"Committed Effective Dose Equivalent\" in excess of 100 millirems during the course of the pregnancy, in accordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \"Standards for Protection Against Radiation.\"\nIf the declared pregnant woman's exposure approaches 350 millirems prior to the end of the gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall recommend to the declared pregnant woman and her work supervisor that she reduce her use of radioactive materials. If the declared pregnant woman's exposure reaches or exceeds 450 millirems prior to the end of the gestation period, the radiation safety officer shall notify her supervisor, remove her radiation dosimeters and rescind her authorization to use radioactive material for the remainder of her pregnancy.\nDeclared pregnant women desiring to further limit their exposure may do so. Any resulting changes in work routine are to be coordinated with their work supervisor.\nRecords\nThe radiation safety officer shall maintain all official declarations of pregnancy and exposure records in accordance with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \"Standards for Protection Against Radiation.\"\nReferences\n\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 19, \"Notices, Instructions, and Reports to Workers: Inspection and Investigations.\"\nTitle 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, \"Standards for Protection Against Radiation.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Introduction\nCarnegie Mellon University has adopted this policy to facilitate the voluntary retirement of tenured faculty. While faculty are not constrained to retire at any particular age, arrangements for retirement are naturally a part of a faculty member's personal and professional planning. The policy provides information, resources and, in some cases, incentives to faculty members that should make financial and retirement planning easier. This policy is aimed as well at promoting the well-being of emeritus faculty and encouraging their continued participation in the Carnegie Mellon academic community.A clear, uniform and fiscally responsible policy is to the overall advantage of both the faculty and the university.\u00a0\u00a0 It helps faculty and their respective departments plan for retirement in an orderly way. While retaining the presence and contributions of those who want to be actively engaged, it potentially opens positions for new faculty.The decision to retire is left to the discretion of the individual faculty members, and remains entirely voluntary.\u00a0 However, if a faculty member decides to retire, this policy provides several retirement options so as to make available possibilities that fit individual circumstances: a monetary incentive retirement option; a phased retirement option; and an option for retirement with subsequent teaching and\/or research.\u00a0 Financial planning and retirement information will be made available by the university to all faculty and their spouses, see Section V below.\u00a0 All retired tenured faculty become emeritus faculty, upon approval by the Board of Trustees, with the rights and privileges described below.Although this policy refers to employee benefits, such as health insurance and life insurance, it is intended that all employee benefits continue to be provided through, and governed by, the terms of the employee benefit plans maintained by Carnegie Mellon University, as those plans may be amended from time to time, including such amendments as may be necessary to implement this policy. This policy in itself does not constitute an employee benefit plan or an amendment to any such plan. The university retains the right to alter, eliminate or revise this policy at any time in the future.\nll. Monetary Incentive Retirement Option\nA monetary incentive is available to tenured faculty members with ten or more years of service on the tenure track who make a decision to retire during the \"window\" period below within the requirements of this section, provided that at the end of the window period, the faculty member has completed ten or more years of service on the tenure track. The \" window period\" begins on the July 1 coinciding with or immediately preceding the date on which the tenured faculty member reaches the age of 64 and ends on the June 30 after the faculty member reaches the age of 66.\u00a0 To receive the monetary incentive under this option of the policy, the faculty member must, during the window period, notify the provost in writing that the faculty member irrevocably elects to retire by the end of the first full academic year thereafter at the latest.\u00a0 If a tenured faculty member makes the irrevocable election during this window period, and accordingly retires by the end of the first\u00a0 full academic year following his or her election, the faculty member will receive an incentive payment equal to his or her nine-month academic year salary for the academic year that ends with retirement (hereinafter \u201cbase pay\u201d).\u00a0 The incentive payment will be made within 30 days following the effective date of retirement.(One Time Window After Effective date of Revisions on September 1, 2016)For the first 180 days following the effective date of the revisions to this option (from September 1, 2016 to February 28, 2017), any tenured faculty member who meets the 10-year service requirement (e.g., has completed ten or more years of service on the tenure track) and is over the age of 66 may elect to retire under this option.\u00a0 In order to elect the option, the faculty member must notify the provost in writing between September 1, 2016 and February 28, 2017 that the faculty member irrevocably elects to retire by the end of the first full academic year thereafter at the latest. If the tenured faculty member makes the irrevocable election and retires by the end of the first full academic year following his or her election, the amount of the incentive payment will be equal to his or her base pay for the academic year that ends with retirement.(Extended Window for Faculty Who Meet The Service Requirement After Age 66)Tenured faculty (current or future) who will not have satisfied the requirement for a minimum of ten years of service until after the age of 66 are nevertheless eligible to participate in the monetary incentive retirement option based on the following provision.\u00a0 At the time the ten-year requirement is satisfied, such faculty shall have a 180-day \"window\" in which to make a written election to retire. A faculty member who makes this election is eligible to receive the maximum benefit under the monetary incentive retirement option, i.e., an amount equal to his or her base pay for the academic year that ends with retirement. If a faculty member so elects to retire, that retirement must occur at the end of a semester (either June 30 or December 31) and not later than the conclusion of the first semester that ends on a date that is at least 180 days after the date of the faculty member's election. A faculty member who elects to retire under the terms of this paragraph must provide the provost with written notice of his or her election to retire at least 90 days before that retirement will take effect.A faculty member who retires under the Monetary Incentive Option of the policy becomes a member of the emeritus faculty upon approval by the Board of Trustees.\nlll. Phased Retirement Option\nA tenured faculty member who has attained age 61 or older and completed ten or more years of service on the tenure track may voluntarily enter phased retirement under this part of the policy. A choice to enter phased retirement must be made and communicated to the provost at least one full year prior to the beginning of phased retirement. If a faculty member chooses the option of phased retirement, that faculty member may not thereafter participate in the monetary option described in Section II above. Similarly, a faculty member who elects the monetary option described in Section II above may not participate in the Phased Retirement Option described in this Section III.Upon entering phased retirement, the faculty member will be permitted to work half-time for up to four academic years and, in return, voluntarily agrees to retire by the end of that period. (The faculty member may retire after fewer than four academic years.) Half-time work can be achieved either by working full-time during one semester and not working the other semester, or by working half-time both semesters in any given academic year. The choice of how to achieve half-time work will be made by mutual agreement of the faculty member and the respective department or unit head, subject to approval of the dean. Compensation will correspond to the option chosen: 50% of academic year base pay paid over the pay periods of either the Fall or Spring semester when the faculty member chooses to work full-time (under the first option), or 50% of academic year base pay paid over the 9 months of the academic year where the faculty member elects to work half-time over the full year (under the second option).In either case, the faculty member will receive benefits in accordance with the Carnegie Mellon University Benefit Plans as they may be amended from time to time.\u00a0 The faculty member will be eligible throughout the academic year for health care, dental and vision insurance on the same terms and conditions as if working full time. The faculty member will be eligible throughout the academic year for the same life insurance to which the faculty member would be entitled if working full-time throughout the academic year, with the understanding that, if the provision of such life insurance would cause the life insurance feature of the Carnegie Mellon University Benefit Plan to be discriminatory under the Internal Revenue Code, a separate plan may be established for such faculty members and the cost of such coverage might not be exempt from federal income tax. The amount of life insurance coverage will be based on the faculty member\u2019s \u201cannualized base salary\u201d (the salary that he or she would have been receiving if he or she had not elected phased retirement), without regard to the reduced salary that the faculty member is receiving during the phased retirement period.\u00a0 Similarly, the faculty member will remain eligible for short-term disability coverage on the same terms and conditions as if working full-time, and benefits will be calculated based on the faculty member\u2019s \u201cannualized base salary.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Disability benefits will only be payable during the academic year when the faculty member would otherwise have been receiving pay. Retirement benefits will be unaffected; that is, the Carnegie Mellon University Faculty and Staff Retirement Plan will be applied in accordance with its terms to the pattern of employment and compensation resulting from phased retirement, such that retirement benefits will be based on the reduced salary earned during the phased retirement period.A faculty member who retires through this phased retirement plan will be freed, if desired, from department\/unit, committee, administrative and other duties as far as possible during the period of phased retirement.Upon retirement, the faculty member becomes a member of the emeritus faculty upon approval by the Board of Trustees.\nIV. Option for Retirement with Subsequent Teaching\nThis part of the policy permits a faculty member who has retired and has been granted emeritus status to perform a limited amount of subsequent teaching or to serve as an investigator on externally funded research projects, subject to approval of the relevant department or unit head and dean.\u00a0 In order to facilitate such teaching and\/or funded research, the faculty member must be given an active appointment that sets forth, among other things, the percentage commitment, duration, and the basis and amount of compensation.\u00a0 Depending on the nature of the appointment given and level of commitment, the faculty member may be eligible for certain benefits in accordance with the terms of the applicable benefit plans under the circumstances.\nV. Financial and Retirement Planning\nThe university will make available to faculty and their spouses programs and materials relevant to financial and retirement planning. The university will designate a person within Human Resources who will be a readily accessible contact for assistance to prospective retiring faculty members in getting information on health care (including Medicare), Social Security, pension elections and other matters related to retirement. Materials available should include a compendium of the provisions of the various benefit plans that pertain to retirement, booklets issued by various government agencies on topics such as Medicare and Social Security, and informational materials prepared by organizations such as the AARP.In addition, programs and materials will be provided by outside organizations and professionals, such as TIAA and Vanguard, rather than by the university itself, but at no cost to the faculty members. These programs will include the opportunity to meet individually or in groups to discuss aspects of financial and retirement planning.It is understood that assistance with financial planning under this policy will not encompass such arrangements or advice as would cast the university in the role of a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to investment advice.\nVI. Emeritus Status\nTenured faculty retiring under the university's Policy to Provide Retirement Options for Tenured Faculty will become associate professor or professor, emeritus or emerita upon approval by the Board of Trustees. Emeritus faculty are encouraged to continue playing an active role in their academic discipline, in their department and in the intellectual life of the university generally.\u00a0 This can include continuing to supervise doctoral students, serving as an investigator on externally funded projects and limited teaching (as set forth in Section IV above), subject to agreement and approval by the relevant department or unit head and Dean.\u00a0 Further information regarding emeritus faculty rights and benefits can be found in the University\u2019s Policy on Emeritus Faculty at the link above.\nVII. Miscellaneous\nThis policy will be administered by the Provost.This policy to provide retirement options for tenured faculty is expected to continue indefinitely. However, the university reserves the right to amend or terminate this policy at any time.Since the benefits of Section II, III, IV and VI of this policy are over and above the benefits otherwise available to tenured faculty upon retirement, and further since retirement under the terms of this policy is entirely voluntary on the part of the faculty member, a valid election under Section II, III or IV will be conditioned upon the faculty member's executing (and not revoking) a release, in the standard form used by the university at that time, when the election to retire is made under the applicable section.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on Policy content should be directed to the Office of Community Standards and Integrity, 412-268-2140.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION:\nFor disciplinary action procedures that apply to charges of cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized assistance, see: Undergraduate Student Academic Disciplinary Actions Procedures Graduate Student Academic Disciplinary Actions Procedures\n\n\n\n Students at Carnegie Mellon are engaged in intellectual activity consistent with the highest standards of the academy. The relationship between students and instructors and their shared commitment to overarching standards of respect, honor and transparency determine the integrity of our community of scholars. The actions of our students, faculty and staff are a representation of our university community and of the professional and personal communities that we lead. Therefore, a deep and abiding commitment to academic integrity is fundamental to a Carnegie Mellon education. Honesty and good faith, clarity in the communication of core values, professional conduct of work, mutual trust and respect, and fairness and exemplary behavior represent the expectations for ethical behavior for all members of the Carnegie Mellon community.\nPolicy Statement\nIn any manner of presentation, it is the responsibility of each student to produce her\/his own original academic work. Collaboration or assistance on academic work to be graded is not permitted unless explicitly authorized by the course instructor(s). Students may utilize the assistance provided by Academic Development, the Global Communication Center, and the Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q) unless specifically prohibited by the course instructor(s). Any other sources of collaboration or assistance must be specifically authorized by the course instructor(s).  In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources is required. When collaboration or assistance is permitted by the course instructor(s) or when a student utilizes the services provided by Academic Development, the Global Communication Center, and the Academic Resource Center (CMU-Q), the acknowledgement of any collaboration or assistance is likewise required. This citation and acknowledgement must be incorporated into the work submitted and not separately or at a later point in time. Failure to do so is dishonest and is subject to disciplinary action.  Instructors have a duty to communicate their expectations including those specific to collaboration, assistance, citation and acknowledgement within each course. Students likewise have a duty to ensure that they understand and abide by the standards that apply in any course or academic activity. In the absence of such understanding, it is the student\u2019s responsibility to seek additional information and clarification. \nPolicy Violations\nCheating occurs when a student avails her\/himself of an unfair or disallowed advantage which includes but is not limited to:\nTheft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from previous course offerings.\nUse of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during an examination.\nCopying from the examination or work of another person or source.\nSubmission or use of falsified data.\nUsing false statements to obtain additional time or other accommodation.\nFalsification of academic credentials.\n\nPlagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in academic work to be graded. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to:\n\nText, either written or spoken, quoted directly or paraphrased.\nGraphic elements.\nPassages of music, existing either as sound or as notation.\nMathematical proofs.\nScientific data.\nConcepts or material derived from the work, published or unpublished, of another person.\n\nUnauthorized assistance refers to the use of sources of support that have not been specifically authorized in this policy statement or by the course instructor(s) in the completion of academic work to be graded. Such sources of support may include but are not limited to advice or help provided by another individual, published or unpublished written sources, and electronic sources. Examples of unauthorized assistance include but are not limited to:\n\nCollaboration on any assignment beyond the standards authorized by this policy statement and the course instructor(s).\nSubmission of work completed or edited in whole or in part by another person.\nSupplying or communicating unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings, in any way to another student.\nUse of unauthorized information or materials, including graded work and answer keys from previous course offerings.\nUse of unauthorized devices.\nSubmission for credit of previously completed graded work in a second course without first obtaining permission from the instructor(s) of the second course. In the case of concurrent courses, permission to submit the same work for credit in two courses must be obtained from the instructors of both courses.\n\nProcedures for dealing with allegations of these policy violations are detailed in the university\u2019s Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures for Undergraduate Students and the Academic Disciplinary Action Procedures for Graduate Students, which are published in The WORD student handbook. Periodic review of these procedures will be overseen by the Dean of Student Affairs or her\/his designee in consultation with Faculty Senate and the relevant student governing bodies. Any amendments to these procedures are subject to the approval of Faculty Senate.

To be in compliance with the tax code, students must understand their tax status.\nU.S. Income and Tax Status for U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents\nGraduate students receiving financial awards that are scholarships, fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships and other analogous stipends are required to pay U.S. income tax on these funds as follows:\n\nIf a student is not a degree candidate, all award funds are taxable.\nIf a student is a degree candidate, the amount of any award used for tuition, fees and required books, supplies and equipment is not taxable. The amount used for other expenses such as room, board and travel is taxable.\nThe part of any award that represents payment for the student's services such as teaching, research or other service (e.g., writing, administrative assistance, etc.) is taxable.\n\nIn computing student taxes for W-2s, the university can determine centrally the part of a student's non-taxable income that covers tuition and fees, since the university establishes these costs. But the portion of stipends required to cover other expenses varies among departments and\/or individual students. If a department submits a standard figure that represents known, fixed, documentable fees for required non-tuition educational expenses, these fees may be excluded from the taxable income a priori. In all other cases, graduate students must establish how much of their award is used for required educational expenses (i.e., books, supplies and equipment) and how much for a living stipend.\nAs a matter of standard university practice, the university will exclude the amount of the student's award that is used for tuition and fees from taxable income; that part will not show on a Form W-2.\nThe university will exclude an amount for other educational expenses in those cases where departments have identified known, documentable, excludable expenses. Those identified amounts should be included with the tuition amounts and so entered in HREM under a tax type 01. In all other cases, the balance of the award should be entered as taxable in HREM so the appropriate taxes will be withheld.\nShould a student have a question about his\/her Federal Income Tax status, please refer to IRS publications 520, \"Scholarships and Fellowships,\" and pages 12-18 of Publication 901, \"U.S. Tax Treaties.\" Information regarding these publications may be found at www.irs.gov.\nForeign Students and Permanent Residents\nNote: These rules do not necessarily apply to foreign students.\nFor tax purposes, citizens and permanent residents are considered residents but foreign students may be residents or non-residents. Information on residency status can be found in IRS publication 519. Some foreign students may benefit from specific tax treaties between the U.S. and their countries. Information on tax treaties is contained in IRS publication 901. The Office of International Education (OIE) sponsors seminars every spring on these tax issues. For more information on these seminars contact OIE; for more information on specific taxation questions, visit www.irs.gov.\nPennsylvania Individual Income Tax\nAccording to the regulations of the Pennsylvania Individual Income Tax Act, fellowship awards and stipends are taxable compensation for service if the recipient is required to apply his skill and training to advance research, creative work, or some other project or activity, unless he or she can show that the recipient is a candidate for a degree and the same activities are required of all degree candidates for that degree as a condition to receiving the degree.\nAs long as the services rendered by a graduate student are a standard part of the degree requirements for students in a program, no tax must be paid or withheld. At Carnegie Mellon, where graduate students are required to render services, those requirements are generally a standard part of the degree program for all students similarly situated; as long as departments document this fact, the university will not withhold Pennsylvania Individual Income Tax from semi-monthly checks.\nShould a graduate student have a problem with the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue seeking to tax some or all of their award, the student's department should contact the CMU Works Service Center for the letter to complete on behalf of the student requesting the information. The Service Center will provide the tax year and income paid, and the remaining information will be completed by the department before providing to the employee.\u00a0\u00a0The letter should be sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. Further tax information from Pennsylvania can be obtained by visiting the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue website.\nCity of Pittsburgh and School District of Pittsburgh\nUnder regulations issued by the City of Pittsburgh that cover both entities, payments made to \"a ... post graduate student who has not yet achieved the degree they are seeking, for services rendered in connection with their educational advancement and as part of the program for obtaining this degree, are not subject to the Earned Income Tax when such payments are in the nature of a fellowship, grant or stipend.\" Regulation 202 (m), Chapters 245 and 246, Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances, Revised: December, 1986. Based on this regulation, Carnegie Mellon does not withhold earned income tax from graduate students who are living within the city, town, municipality, borough, township or school district.\nShould the city notify a student that they should be paying the city and school district earned income tax, Payroll Services will issue a letter explaining the situation to the city and the reason we believe the stipend to be non-taxable by the city and school district.

Questions on Policy content should be directed to the Environmental Facilities Coordinator, Facilities Manangement Services, 412-268-7858.\n\n\n\nDATE OF ISSUANCE:\n\nThis policy was originally issued to campus on October 5, 1990 as a presidential policy memo, Recycling Policy for Carnegie Mellon.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribes the university's recycling program and waste reduction efforts.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION:\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon Green Practices\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement \nThis is to announce the adoption of the following Recycling Policy for the university.\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to recycling the materials it uses and to minimizing non-hazardous waste. It is the responsibility of every member of the campus community to support these efforts that will protect our environment by conserving resources and preserving rapidly diminishing landfill space. The implementation of a campus-wide recycling program is the first step toward developing a comprehensive environmental policy for Carnegie Mellon. Recycling is just one part of a much larger program of activities through which Carnegie Mellon will take an increasingly active role to further understanding and preservation of our environment in the years to come.\nFacilities Management Services is responsible for the implementation of Carnegie Mellon's recycling program. The Environmental Coordinator in this department will be responsible for the management of the recycling program and coordination of waste reduction efforts on campus. Each department will designate, in writing, an official Recycling Liaison who will coordinate departmental recycling efforts with the Carnegie Mellon Environmental Coordinator.\nThe entire campus community is expected to actively participate in Carnegie Mellon's Recycling Program and waste reduction efforts. This involves three distinct activities.\n\nRecycling of paper, cardboard and beverage cans (aluminum and bimetal).\nSource Reduction: This includes but is not limited to making double-sided copies, increased use of electronic mail instead of memos, reuse\/resale of surplus furniture, etc.\nPurchasing products made from recycled materials. The long-term success of recycling programs in this country depends on the creation of markets for recycled materials. All departments should purchase recycled products wherever economically feasible.\n\nRecycling programs already functioning on campus are encouraged to continue and expand provided that they do not hinder the campus-wide recycling program. Individuals responsible for such programs must provide recycling volume data to the Carnegie Mellon University Environmental Coordinator to permit the university to comply with Pennsylvania Act 101 (Pennsylvania Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 101 of 1988).\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It also provides structure for how university-recognized alumni and donor groups may be developed. This will help ensure efforts to engage alumni are efficient, are aligned with overall Advancement and university goals, and provide a uniform positive experience for alumni.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nAlumni Status: Who is Considered an Alumnus\/a of Carnegie Mellon University?\nDegree-holders are automatically considered alumni.\nNon-degree holders who were admitted to any college or school of Carnegie Mellon University and then departed the university in good standing after completing at least one semester may be considered alumni. It is recommended that these individuals contact the university to verify their alumni status.\n\nAlumni Association Membership\nAll university alumni are automatically members of the Carnegie Mellon University Alumni Association (CMUAA). Alumni do not need to opt-in or pay a membership fee in order to be part of the CMUAA.\nAs stated in the CMUAA Board Bylaws, CMUAA membership will also be extended to honorary degree recipients and honorary members.\n\nAlumni Awards and Honors\nThe CMUAA manages and administers an Alumni Awards program that recognizes university alumni for their achievements and contributions to society, as well as their service to the university. Should other university colleges, schools, and departments develop award programs to recognize their respective alumni, any such program will be coordinated with the CMUAA to ensure consistency and avoid confusion among programs.\nThe notification of award honorees who are university fundraising prospects should also be coordinated with the individual\u2019s\/organization\u2019s Prospect Relationship Manager. Please see the university\u2019s Prospect Management Policy for further information.\n\nAlumni Communications and Surveys\nIn order to ensure communications standards and best practices are adhered to, all official communications to broad groups of alumni, donors, and prospects (i.e., beyond a college\u2019s, school\u2019s, or department\u2019s own constituency) will be coordinated with and approved by the CMUAA and\/or Advancement Communications. These communications include, but are not limited to: event notices, surveys, emails, announcements, and newsletters.\nColleges, schools, and departments may communicate to constituents who are affiliated with their respective units without approval by the CMUAA and\/or Advancement Communications, provided they request updated contact and exclusion data from the Advancement Programs and Services Office. Please also see the University Advancement Data Confidentiality and Usage Policy.\nIn addition, it is highly recommended that colleges, schools, and departments coordinate the scheduling of their communications with Advancement Communications to help prevent constituents from receiving multiple university communications at one time and to avoid survey fatigue and information overload.\n\nAlumni Volunteer Networks\nThe purpose of alumni volunteer networks, organized regionally or by special interests, is to support and further the mission of the CMUAA and the university. When alumni volunteer networks are officially recognized, they benefit by having access to CMUAA expertise and support in communications, marketing, events management, resources, and fundraising efforts.\nIn order for an alumni organization to have the designation of an official university network, the approval of the CMUAA is necessary. To be considered an active network, the group must meet the following minimum standards:\nCoordinate efforts with the staff of the CMUAA or other university representative(s)\nMaintain active volunteer leadership\nAdhere to standards and operating principles set forth by the CMUAA and the university\n\nIndividuals or groups that are not officially recognized by the CMUAA or university will not be permitted to use the university name, logos, service marks, or brand.\n\nDonor Recognition Societies for Alumni and Other Donors\nThe purpose of donor recognition societies, both college-based and university-wide, is to recognize varying types and levels of giving, and develop donor communities.\nActivities and perquisites of each society correspond to the amount and nature of support. It is of the utmost importance that recognition societies are equitable and consistent across the university. Therefore, all new donor recognition societies must be approved by University Advancement prior to being operationalized.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

General questions about Policy content should be directed to the University Registrar's Office, 412-268-7404. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\nTransfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment Policy\n\n\n\nStatement\nCross-registration provides opportunities for enriched educational programs by permitting full-time paying undergraduate and graduate students to cross-register for one course at a Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE) Institution.\u00a0 Full-time Carnegie Mellon degree students are eligible.\u00a0 The PCHE course may not count towards full-time status unless the student is enrolled in an inter-university program.\u00a0 There is no additional tuition charge, except for special course or laboratory fees. Carnegie Mellon students do not acquire status at the host institution, but are given library and bookstore privileges. Credit and grades are transferred directly to the home institution.\u00a0 Cross-registration is not applicable during the Summer Session(s) or during intersessions.\nThere are nine approved PCHE Institutions in the Pittsburgh area:\nCarlow University\u00a0(578-6084), Chatham College (365-1121), CCAC (237-2555), Duquesne University (396-6230), LaRoche College (367-9300), Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (362-5610), Point Park University\u00a0(392-3861), Robert Morris College (262-8256), University of Pittsburgh (624-1544)\n\nEach college or university accepts registration from the other institutions; however, first priority is given to students of the host institution, and not all departments or schools in all institutions are able to participate in this program.\nIn each case of a student cross-registration, the approval of the dean or a designated individual from the home college or university must be obtained prior to registration.\nIn addition, the student's advisor or dean is responsible for assuring the student's eligibility for the course in which he\/she intends to enroll.\nFull credit and grades for cross-registered courses will be transferred to the appropriate institution; the academic regulations of the host university will prevail.\nThe academic honesty code and other rules of conduct of the institution providing instruction apply with respect to its courses and behavior on its campus. That institution also determines whether its rules have or have not been violated. The student's own institution will impose such penalties as it considers proper when violations are reported to it.\nCross-registrants do not thereby acquire the status of students in the institutions in which they are receiving instruction (e.g., for purposes of participation in student activities, insurance programs, etc.). They do receive library privileges at the host institution and may purchase course texts at the host bookstore.\nEach qualified student normally may enroll in no more than one course off campus in any one term or semester under this program. Students wishing to cross-register for more than one course in a term must have approval from the appropriate academic offices at both schools.\nNo additional tuition charge is made to students who are participating in this program; however, the student who cross-registers is responsible for paying any course or laboratory fees to the host.\nCross-registration does not apply to summer sessions at any of the institutions.\nAdding or dropping a course after the home institution's deadline date requires permission from the home institution; adding or dropping a course after the host institution's deadline date requires permission from the host institution.\nStudents enrolled in approved joint co-op programs between two PCHE institutions are exempt from the requirement of being full-time at either school in order to cross register. Students are bound by the requirements of that program.\nCarnegie Mellon students may not cross-register for required courses that are normally available at Carnegie Mellon. Exceptions may be made if courses are unavailable or legitimate schedule conflicts seriously hinder completion of degree requirements within the prescribed timeframe.\n\"PCHE Cross-Registration Request\" forms are available from The HUB.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

The effective date is January 1, 2002.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Provost. Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\nAppointment and Tenure Policy of Carnegie Mellon University Teaching Track Appointments Librarian and Archivist Appointments Research Faculty Appointments Policy on Faculty Leaves (including Faculty Family Leave)\n\n\n\nRELATED FORMS:\nOnline forms can be found on the Faculty Leaves page of the Vice Provost for Faculty website.\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nA regular faculty member (tenure-track, teaching-track, librarian and archivist-track and research-track) who is the parent of a newborn child, or who has adopted a child of pre-school age, and who is the primary care giver of the child, is entitled to a one semester paid leave of absence. Teaching or other duties that would otherwise be carried out during the period of leave may not be shifted to other semesters against the wishes of the person taking such paid leave. Tenure-track faculty members without tenure who take a one-semester paid parental leave, may, at their discretion, exclude one year from current service for the purpose of determining the tenure decision deadline. Reappointment and promotion clocks may similarly be delayed by one year for all regular faculty taking one semester of paid parental leave.\nThis policy will be implemented subject to the following:\n\nFor a period of three years following the commencement of this policy (effective date: January 1, 2002), requests for paid faculty parental leave, and specifics about each case, will be submitted to the Provost for approval. After three years, refinements and elaborations (if any) to procedures set forth below will be codified, requiring approval by Employee Retirement and Welfare Benefit Plan Committee (ERWBPC) and the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate.\nDuring the first three years, at least once a year, or more frequently if requested by the Faculty Senate, the Provost will meet with the Faculty Senate Executive Committee to report on any issues that may have arisen regarding paid faculty parental leaves.\nExcept in exceptional circumstances, the leave should occur within the first 12 months of the birth or adoptive placement of a child. In some instances, some part of the leave may occur before the birth of the child, but generally the bulk of the leave will be taken after the birth of the child.\nThe CMU Benefits Pool will cover the salary and benefits of the faculty member during this paid leave of absence.\nThe Provost will, in the first three years of this policy, seek to clarify and adjust criteria for status as a \"primary care giver,\" starting from the presumption that primary care givers have fewer than 30 hours of child care assistance per week, paid or otherwise.\nIt is not the intent of the policy to provide salary support when otherwise there would be none, e.g., during the summer.\nThe intent of the policy is to provide paid leave for parents of children of pre-school age. So, for example, if a faculty member marries someone with older children, and proceeds to adopt these children, he or she is not necessarily entitled to receive benefits under this policy.\nThe university, deans, and department heads shall communicate these benefits to all regular faculty and be supportive during their use.\nNothing in this Policy is intended to interfere with or supersede a faculty member's right to unpaid leave in accordance with the university's policy under the Family and Medical Leave Act or the right to paid disability leave under the university's disability benefits plans, although parental leave under this Policy may be required to run concurrently with such other leaves.\n\u00a0  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It appears in the current issue of the Faculty Handbook.\n\n\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\n\nOffice of the Provost. Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684. For questions regarding initiating new membership in a specific organization, see your dean or department head.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe university holds institutional memberships in various organizations and does not pay membership dues for an individual in a professional society for reasons of that individual's personal professional development.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nFor clarification and orderly administration of individual and institutional memberships in professional organizations, the following policy is adopted:\n1. Carnegie Mellon does not pay membership dues for an individual in a professional society to which he belongs for reasons of his personal professional development -- for example, the society established in his field (such as American Chemical Society, American Institute of Electrical Engineers, American Economic Association, American Institute of Architects), or in a group of fields including his own (such as Modern Language Association, American Society for Engineering Education, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, etc.). The distinctive element here is that this type of membership is beneficial to the individual in his profession and in the performance of his duties at Carnegie Mellon.\n2. Carnegie Mellon holds institutional memberships in various organizations which benefit the institution and in those organizations which Carnegie Mellon wishes to support because they serve the welfare of higher education at large. In those instances in which Carnegie Mellon holds membership in an organization and an institutional representative is called for, Carnegie Mellon designates a member of the faculty or administration as its official representative. In other instances it is proper for Carnegie Mellon to pay an individual's membership dues in an organization in order to obtain benefits for Carnegie Mellon that could not be obtained otherwise or that otherwise would cost more (for example, an individual membership in the American Mathematical Society brings us copies of its publication at reduced rates).\n3. There may, of course, be instances which lie somewhere between the clear-cut types of membership described in items 1 and 2 above. In these instances the following procedure will be followed:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a. New membership for Carnegie Mellon or for a faculty or a new staff member.  The dean or other administrative officer involved will get full information from the faculty or staff member about the proposed membership. He will discuss the question with the vice president for business affairs. If they do not agree, the question of whether Carnegie Mellon pays the dues or not will be resolved by the president.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 b. New membership for Carnegie Mellon or for a dean or other administrative officer.  The individual concerned will carefully analyze the proposed membership to see whether its major values would apply to himself as a professional person and administrator of his own division or to the institution in general. He will discuss the question with the vice president for business affairs. If they hold different views, the question will be resolved by the president.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions about policy content should be directed to the vice president and chief financial officer, ext. 8-2992.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED DOCUMENTS:\n\nAuxiliary and Recharge Service Centers Financial Records Retention Articles of Incorporation of Carnegie Mellon University Bylaws of Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThis policy outlines the roles and responsibilities of various university officers and organizations in managing the university's financial assets. This policy was developed in compliance with the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of Carnegie Mellon, donor stipulations, government regulations and generally accepted accounting principles. Carnegie Mellon relies on the integrity and careful judgment of its employees who have financial management responsibilities. The policy reflects the responsibilities of these employees to ensure the long-term financial viability of the university.\nDelegated Responsibility\nBoard of Trustees\nBy the terms of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of Carnegie Mellon University, the university's trustees maintain fiduciary responsibility for the assets of Carnegie Mellon University. The trustees have corporate powers and privileges; that is, they may organize and act as a board of trustees, elect officers and adopt bylaws. The Board of Trustees has delegated responsibility to individual university officers for management of university operating, non-operating and capital assets.\nInvestment Committee\nThe Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees is responsible for the investment and reinvestment of funds and the purchase and sale of securities constituting the endowment or other long-term pool assets of the university, and shall prescribe and approve the investment policies for any investment agents acting for the university. In carrying out its responsibility for the investment and reinvestment of funds and the purchase and sale of securities constituting the endowment or other long-term pool assets of the university, the Investment Committee gives the chief financial officer, or chief investment officer, or treasurer, or assistant treasurer such authority as is necessary to carry out the decisions of the committee.\nPresident\nThe Board of Trustees has delegated responsibility to the president for the management of the university's operating and capital assets. The president, working with the provost, has responsibilities for broad allocation of university resources. The president has direct responsibility for the management of administrative operating assets. Within parameters approved by the Board of Trustees, the president has responsibility for making allocations of such funds and monitoring the overall use of the funds in accordance with university budgetary limits and established university policies and practices.\nProvost\nThe president has delegated responsibility to the provost for the management of academic and sponsored project assets. Within the parameters defined by the president, the provost has responsibility for making allocations of such funds to the academic or research units and monitoring the overall use of the funds in accordance with university budgetary limits and established university policies and practices.\nThe provost has responsibility for review and approval of all sponsored project agreements to ensure legal and financial terms are acceptable to the university (obligations, commitments, sponsor billing arrangements, subcontractor billing arrangements, cost recovery provisions, etc.).\nWhere indirect cost recovery is not provided by the sponsor, the provost, in consultation with the chief financial officer, has responsibility for reviewing and accepting justification for performing the work at a financial loss to the university or securing indirect funding from one of the academic or research units.\nFaculty Senate\nThe Faculty Senate serves in an advisory role for the university's overall financial affairs. The chair and vice chair of Faculty Senate's Budget and Financial Affairs Committee attend Board of Trustees Finance Committee meetings.\nChief Financial Officer\nThe chief financial officer plays a central role in assuring that the university meets its fiduciary responsibility to donors, government officials, employees, students and the general public. As such, the chief financial officer has authority over internal control and financial reporting matters throughout the university.\nThe chief financial officer evaluates the adequacy and quality of financial reporting to ensure reports submitted by business units meet the standards defined by the president, provost and chief financial officer.\nThe chief financial officer has responsibility for establishing and monitoring a sound business environment so that various funding sources (such as government agencies, donors, students and bondholders) can confidently provide resources in support of the university's academic mission. To ensure this sound business environment, the chief financial officer develops and monitors university policies related to internal control, financial and accounting requirements, procurement, sponsored project financial administration, indirect costs, service centers, facilities management, administrative system use and human resources.\nThe chief financial officer ensures the accessibility of financial information for those responsible for financial management. The chief financial officer is responsible for providing training to users of financial information to assure compliance with proper business practices.\nColleges, Divisions and Departments\nEach college, division and department must follow university-prescribed procedures to assure that expenditures charged to their accounts are: reasonable and necessary; consistent with established university policies and practices; applicable to the work of the university (including instruction, research and public service); and consistent with sponsor or donor terms, conditions and expenditure restrictions.\nEach college, division and department must also follow university-prescribed procedures to assure that revenues generated by the college are: within the university's tax-exempt purpose; consistent with established university policies; supported by consistent, established pricing structures that recover direct and indirect costs (exceptions only as authorized); and can be discharged or completed by university action or delivery.\nDeans, vice presidents and department heads are accountable for balancing expenditures against revenues (university allocated or generated from external sources) so that no unfavorable operating results (deficits) are incurred for the college, division or department as a whole.\nColleges, divisions and departments are responsible for reflecting all approved plans and initiatives in their financial budgets and projections.\nPrincipal Investigators\nPrincipal investigators have overall responsibility for the technical and financial management of their projects, in accordance with established university policies and procedures. Principal investigators should have a good understanding of the financial status of their projects to ensure that financial transactions are consistent with the sponsor or donor terms, conditions and expenditure restrictions. It is the principal investigator's responsibility to ensure appropriateness of all direct contract charges. These responsibilities may not be delegated. Principal investigators must inform their dean and\/or department head, in advance, of potential funding issues.\nIf, upon termination of the sponsored project award (contract, grant or other type of support), the project's account is in a deficit position and additional funds are not available from the original sponsor, the principal investigator has responsibility to clear the deficit by securing additional, qualified external funding. If external funding is not available, the principal investigator shall obtain funding from the college or department.\nEmployees with Financial Responsibility\nWithin colleges, administrative divisions and departments, staff with financial management responsibilities are accountable for the execution or review of all transactions in accordance with established university policies and procedures. These employees (financial managers) are given latitude in performing their review before or after the transaction has occurred and on a detail transaction or summary account basis, except where prior approval or detail transaction review is required by policy or sponsor (e.g., purchase orders over prescribed thresholds, foreign travel, equipment in certain circumstances, cost sharing, cost transfers, etc.).\nIt is the financial manager's responsibility to monitor overall expenditures in comparison to revenues and budgets and to notify the dean, vice president or department head when unfavorable variances are expected or incurred. Financial managers may be requested to identify alternate funding sources within the college, division or department to cover unfavorable variances but are not accountable for the overall balancing of the college, division or department's funding as a whole. (See Colleges, Divisions and Departments.)\nFinancial managers are responsible for providing regular financial reports to the dean, vice president, department head, faculty (where applicable), principal investigators and the university Budget Office. The financial reports shall include actual results, budget, projections and variance analysis. Any expected or incurred deficits must be highlighted on these regular reports. Financial managers are responsible for pursuing explanations for unfavorable variances and documenting plans to eliminate unfavorable variances by fiscal year end or project end, but are not responsible for securing the funding. (See Colleges, Divisions and Departments and Principal Investigators.)\nInternal Audit\nThe Internal Audit department exists to assist university officials and the Board of Trustees in the effective discharge of their responsibilities. Internal Audit is responsible for examining and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of (1) the systems of internal control and their related accounting, financial and operational policies and (2) procedures for financial and compliance monitoring and reporting. The director of internal audit has authority to present reports directly to the president of the university and has independent access to the Board of Trustees' Audit Committee. Internal Audit has direct access to all university books and records.\nAnnual Audit\nTo assure that the university's assets are protected and that transactions and events are properly recorded, an independent auditor selected by the Board of Trustees audits the annual financial statements.\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It was originally adopted by the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees on December 13, 1993. This information is current for the academic year.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Vice President for Operations. Questions about Policy content should be directed to the Benefits Office, 412-268-2047. For information about other forms of financial aid for children attending Carnegie Mellon, contact The HUB at 412-268-8186.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\n\nUndergraduate Tuition Benefits for Children of Faculty\nThe HUB\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nThe Undergraduate Tuition Benefit Program provides a variety of tuition benefits to staff members and their dependents. One feature of the Undergraduate Tuition Benefit Program is to provide tuition benefits to an eligible staff member's dependent children enrolled in undergraduate courses at Carnegie Mellon or other accredited colleges and universities.\nEligibility\nIn order to be eligible for undergraduate tuition benefits, staff members must satisfy the following eligibility requirements:\n\nMust have completed five (5) years of full-time service with Carnegie Mellon; and\nMust be full-time benefits-eligible.\n\nIn order to be eligible for undergraduate tuition benefits, children of staff members must satisfy the following eligibility requirements:\n\nMust meet IRS dependency exemption criteria; and\nMust be born to or legally adopted by the eligible staff member; and\nMust be enrolled in an undergraduate degree program before the age of 30.\n\nService Requirement\nOne year of full-time service will be credited if, during a staff member's employment year, he or she worked full time for nine (9) months; they need not be consecutive months.\nOne month of service credit will be given as long as the staff member is full-time benefits-eligible on the first day of the month. For example, if you begin a full-time appointment on the first day of the month, that month will count as a credit month toward meeting the service requirement; if the appointment begins on the second through the last day of the month, you will not earn one credit month for that month.\nIf you worked part-time and had at least 1,000 hours of service during a year, then you will be credited with half a year of service toward the five (5) year service requirement, for up to three (3) years of credit. The remaining two (2) years of the five (5) year service requirement must have been worked while you were full-time and eligible for this benefit.\nService accumulates during approved university leaves of absence for full-time staff members as summarized below:\n\nDisability Leave of Absence - Applied toward full-time service requirement.\nFamily and Medical Leave - Applied toward full-time service requirement if working full-time when the Family and Medical Leave began.\nPersonal Leave of Absence - Service does not accumulate.\n\nIf a staff member terminates employment at Carnegie Mellon but returns to a full-time position within one year, prior full-time service will apply toward the service requirement. If the staff member is discharged for willful misconduct or does not return within one year from termination, prior full-time service will not be applied toward the service requirement.\nParticipation\nStaff members must meet the eligibility and service requirements set forth above by the following dates:\n\nOctober 1 to be eligible for the Fall term\nFebruary 1 to be eligible for the Winter\/Spring term\nJune 1 to be eligible for the Summer term\n\nEligibility may be continued under the following circumstances:\n\nFor a staff member whose employment terminates, benefits continue to the end of the current term.\nFor a staff member who has a change in employment status (e.g., full-time to part-time status) which would make them ineligible for this benefit during a term, the benefit will cease at the end of the current term in which the employment status change occurs.\nFor a staff member on an approved university leave of absence, eligibility continues (subject to the applicable leave policy) as summarized below:\nDisability Leave of Absence - Benefits paid while on Disability Leave.\nFamily and Medical Leave - Benefits paid while on Family and Medical Leave if working full-time when the Family and Medical Leave began.\nPersonal Leave of Absence - Benefits paid through current term only.\n\nFor an eligible staff member who retires at age 62 or later with at least 15 years of service or for an eligible staff member who retires at age 65 or later with at least ten years of service, dependent children remain eligible during retirement.\nFor an eligible staff member who dies after ten or more years of service, dependent children remain eligible.\nFor a member of the Carnegie Mellon Campus Police Association who is killed in the line of duty, dependent children remain eligible.\n\nBenefit Amount\nTuition Benefits at Carnegie Mellon\nA one hundred percent (100%) tuition benefit is provided for dependent children enrolled in courses at Carnegie Mellon for a maximum of eight terms.\nA fifty percent (50%) tuition benefit is provided for dependent children who enroll in Advanced Placement\/Early Admission (APEA) summer courses. APEA courses do not count as a term toward the eight-term maximum. Pre-college courses are not covered.\nTuition Benefits at Other Institutions\nThe benefit level for full-time undergraduate study at other accredited colleges and universities will be awarded for tuition only, up to the Carnegie Mellon per term benefit amount. The per term benefit amount is announced by Carnegie Mellon from time to time.\nBenefit Coverage\nTuition benefits cover:\n\nCredit-bearing courses only.\nTuition only and are based on the actual tuition charged to the student.\n\nTuition benefits do not cover:\n\nRoom and board, mandatory fees, lab fees, transportation costs or similar fees for credit-bearing courses.\n\nConditions and Limitations\nThe award of tuition benefits to an eligible staff member whose child attends Carnegie Mellon is contingent upon acceptance, enrollment and attendance of the dependent child in a course(s)\/degree program at Carnegie Mellon. An application for tuition benefits is not an application for admission to any course or program nor does it constitute approval for any student to continue in any course or program. Each of these requirements is separate from and is additional to an application for tuition benefits.\nThe award of tuition benefits to an eligible staff member whose child attends another institution is contingent upon acceptance, enrollment and attendance of the dependent child in a full-time undergraduate degree program at the accredited institution.\nTuition benefits are available for eight (8) terms, whether provided for courses at Carnegie Mellon or at another institution. They need not be consecutive terms.\nSummer study (whether full-time or part-time) at Carnegie Mellon or another institution will count as a term.\nPart-time study during the academic year (permitted at Carnegie Mellon only) will also count as a term. If a student is attending Carnegie Mellon on a part-time basis, the staff member may elect to pay for the part-time study themselves rather than using tuition benefits, since the part-time study counts as a term and would be applied toward the 8-term limit.\nTuition benefits at other accredited institutions are limited to two (2) children, even if one child did not exhaust his\/her benefit entitlement. There are no limits on the number of children eligible for tuition benefits at Carnegie Mellon.\nFull-time undergraduate students attending Carnegie Mellon are encouraged to apply for federal grant assistance through the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) by May 1 annually. If you are interested in being considered for any form of financial aid, please contact the HUB at ext. 8-8186 for additional information.\nAll financial aid resources regardless of source(s), including undergraduate tuition benefits, cannot exceed the cost of attendance for the academic year. If tuition benefits result in a student receiving more assistance than the total budgeted cost of education, tuition benefits will be reduced by the amount of the excess.\nState and Local Income Tax Implications\nThe tuition\u00a0benefit paid to other institutions outside of Carnegie Mellon are\u00a0subject to Pennsylvania State and local taxation. Taxes will be withheld from salary, not from the benefit, in the same quarter in which the benefit is paid.\nHow to Apply for Tuition Benefits\nStaff members whose eligible dependent children are enrolling in courses at Carnegie Mellon or other accredited colleges and universities should submit an application through WorkDay. To ensure timely processing, it is recommended that applications are submitted according to the following schedule:\n\nJuly 1 - for the Fall Term\nDecember 1 - for the Winter\/Spring Term\nApril 1 - for the Summer Term\n\nStaff members will be notified of eligibility as soon as a determination is made. Students attending Carnegie Mellon will have tuition benefits awarded through The HUB. Students attending other institutions will have tuition benefits remitted directly to the institution. Since some institutions require payment of tuition and fees at the time of registration, parents should be prepared to pre-pay tuition and fees. If this occurs, parents should make arrangements to obtain reimbursement from the institution that the student attends.\nQuestions, or requests for a paper application, should be addressed to the CMUWorks Service Center, 4516 Henry Street; or by calling 412-268-4600.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

(Note: This Policy supersedes the university\u2019s \u201cAuthority to Commit the University\u201d and \u201cAuthorized Signatures for Agreements, Contracts, Licenses\u201d Policies, both approved by the Board of Trustees on May 17, 1999 and last modified on October 2, 2008, in their entirety.)\u00a0\n\n\nApproved By\nThe Board of Trustees of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n\nEntities Affected By This Policy\nAll members of the university community.\n\n\nWho Needs To Know About This Policy\nAll faculty, staff and students.\n\n\nGlossary\nDefinitions of terms used in this Policy.\n\n\nForms \/ Instructions\nn\/a\n\n\nRelated Information\nn\/a\n\n\nReason for Policy \/ Purpose\nThis policy identifies who is authorized to execute agreements with third parties for and on behalf of the university.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThe Board of Trustees delegates authority to the president and other authorized officials to execute agreements (or series of related agreements) having an aggregate value of $5 million or less without further action by the Board of Trustees, provided that (i) the amounts legally committed and comprising the aggregate value under the relevant agreement (or series of related agreements) are covered by identified revenues or reserves, and (ii) the relevant agreement (or series of related agreements) do not involve or require the university to obtain debt financing. Agreements (or series of related agreements) having an aggregate value in excess of $5 million or involving or requiring the university to obtain debt financing require authorization by the Board of Trustees.Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Board of Trustees, only individuals who are authorized by this policy may execute agreements for and on behalf of the university. All agreements with third parties may only be executed under the legal name of the corporate entity (\u201cCarnegie Mellon University\u201d). \u00a0Delegation of Signature Authority to the President and Other Authorized OfficialsThe Board of Trustees delegates authority to the president and other authorized officials to execute agreements (or series of related agreements) having an aggregate value of $5 million or less without further action by the Board of Trustees, subject to the parameters outlined in this policy and provided that (i) the amounts legally committed and comprising the aggregate value under the relevant agreement (or series of related agreements) are covered by identified revenues or reserves, and (ii) the relevant agreement (or series of related agreements) do not involve or require the university to obtain debt financing. If the aggregate value of an agreement (or series of related agreements) exceeds $5 million or involves or requires the university to obtain debt financing, authorization by the Board of Trustees shall be required.\u00a0 However, agreements (or series of related agreements) wherein the amounts legally committed and comprising the aggregate value thereunder are flow-through funds, such as subcontracts and purchase orders required for implementing sponsored projects, are excluded from this requirement. \u00a0In addition to the foregoing, the Board of Trustees delegates authority to the president, provost and\/or vice president for university advancement to execute agreements for gifts to the university subject to the parameters outlined in this policy and if and only to the extent that the relevant gift\u2019s purpose does not involve commitments (including a series of related components or phases) on behalf of the university having an aggregate value in excess of $5 million that would otherwise be required to be authorized by the Board of Trustees pursuant to this policy, or otherwise as authorized by the Board of Trustees for commitments on behalf of the university having an aggregate value in excess of $5 million.The Board of Trustees delegates authority to the president and\/or vice president and general counsel of the university to execute agreements to retain or engage law firms and attorneys for and on behalf of the university subject to the parameters outlined in this policy.\u00a0 Unless specifically authorized by the president or the vice president and general counsel of the university, no law firms or attorneys may be retained or engaged who will either (a) perform any services for or on behalf of the university (other than teaching as faculty) and\/or (b) be paid from any account of or from funds of the university. Except as otherwise specified in this policy, no other individual has the authority to execute agreements for or on behalf of the university, including any unit, department or other division of the university, in the absence of a formal written delegation of signature authority.\u00a0 Any delegation of authority must be made in writing, drafted, approved and executed by the authorized official and delegate in accordance with the delegation of signature authority provisions outlined in this policy, and maintained on file with the office of the vice president for finance and chief financial officer.The execution of offers of employment, offers of admission, offers of visitation to non-university-funded visitors and internship offers to unpaid interns by a college, school and\/or administrative unit do not, unless otherwise required by the president or provost, require a formal delegation of authority.\u00a0 Each college, school and administrative unit shall therefore, unless otherwise required by the president or provost, adopt and implement its own guidelines governing signatory authority for such offers of employment, offers of admission, visitation offers and internship offers for its college, school or administrative unit, as applicable, and all such offers must comply with the university\u2019s then standard policies and guidelines, including all university and legal requirements. Authorized OfficialsThe president, provost, vice president for finance and chief financial officer, vice provost for research, associate vice president for research and academic administration and treasurer, and each of their authorized delegates (such delegated authorization being in writing and authorized by an authorized official in accordance with the delegation of signature authority provisions outlined in this policy) are authorized to execute agreements related to their respective roles and responsibilities at the university (or as otherwise authorized by the president) in accordance with and subject to the terms outlined above and in this policy. The vice president for university advancement and his\/her authorized delegates is authorized to execute agreements for gifts to the university, and the vice president and general counsel and his\/her authorized delegates is authorized to execute agreements to retain or engage law firms and attorneys for and on behalf of the university, in each case related to their respective roles and responsibilities at the university (or as otherwise authorized by the president) in accordance with and subject to the terms outlined above and in this policy.Each authorized official, as well as such official\u2019s authorized delegates, is responsible for ensuring that he\/she has the authority to execute the relevant agreement, that the terms of such agreement (and any transactions or activities contemplated thereby) comply with all applicable university and legal requirements, and that adequate funding for the obligations under the agreement exists. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where an agreement is denominated in other than U.S. dollars, the exchange rate utilized in the agreement must be reviewed with the vice president for finance and chief financial officer in order to assess the potential impact of possible currency devaluation prior to the agreement\u2019s execution. Each authorized official must maintain on file copies of all agreements executed by such authorized official.\u00a0 \u00a0Authorized officials, as well as their authorized delegates, must endeavor to ensure that the university\u2019s executive leadership team has had an opportunity to review agreements required to be authorized by the Board of Trustees pursuant to this policy (and, therefore, sufficient time should be scheduled to allow for proper review) prior to an authorized official executing the relevant agreement. \u00a0Delegations of Signature AuthorityExcept as otherwise specified in this policy, all delegations of signature authority by an authorized official to a delegate must be expressly granted in a writing (delegation of signature authority) signed by both the authorized official and the delegate. \u00a0\nAuthorized officials desiring to delegate signature authority to a proposed delegate (on a temporary basis or otherwise) must coordinate with the office of general counsel to draft and document an appropriate written delegation of signature authority. The president of the university is reserved the right to proscribe any particular proposed delegation of signature authority. \u00a0 Delegations of signature authority are often limited by the kind of transaction, time, type of agreement, dollar amount or other appropriate limiting criteria, as set forth in the written delegation.\u00a0 An authorized official is not authorized to delegate signature authority in excess of what he\/she has been authorized by this policy.\u00a0 A delegation of signature authority automatically terminates if the authorized delegate either ceases to be employed or engaged by the university or ceases to hold the position specified in the delegation or the position that includes the duties contemplated by the delegation.\u00a0 An authorized delegate is not authorized to execute agreements not authorized by his\/her written signature authority delegation, and is not authorized to further delegate his\/her signature authority.The office of the vice president for finance and chief financial officer will maintain copies of all written authorized signature delegations on file.During an authorized official\u2019s absence (e.g., extended travel), there may be insufficient authorized officials available to execute agreements in order for the university to conduct necessary business in a timely manner. It is important, therefore, for authorized officials to ensure there are sufficient authorized officials and\/or authorized delegates available to execute agreements to conduct necessary business in advance of any absence (e.g., it may be appropriate for an authorized official to delegate signature authority to a delegate on a temporary basis during the absence).\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the associate vice president for Human Resources, ext. 8-3785.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION:\nHuman Resources Representatives\n\n\n\nStatement\nThe policy on flexible work schedules is intended to respond to the needs of full-time staff members for whom the 8:30-to-5:00 schedule is not ideal. Some of the reasons that an individual may wish to work an alternative schedule include:\n\nparticipating in car pooling arrangements,\narranging for child care,\navoiding traffic congestion problems,\ncoordinating schedules with a working spouse,\ncoordinating work schedule with a limited bus schedule,\nseeking faster access to Carnegie Mellon central computing facilities in non-peak hours.\n\nPolicy\nWithin the guidelines described in this announcement, it is university policy to provide all Carnegie Mellon full-time staff members the opportunity to request the hours of work that consistently suit their individual needs. However, it is recognized that it will not be possible to accommodate all such requests for alternative schedules.\nThe university is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and it is expected that all offices will be open during regular university hours.\nGuidelines\n\nUnder flexible working hours, daily hours totaling 7.5 per day, 5 days per week, may be selected during the time 7:30 a.m. through 6:30 p.m.\nSome departments may be unable to offer flexible hours for some positions and\/or during certain times of the year.\nA fixed schedule should be selected for a period of time at least three months in duration.\nLunch time must be scheduled for a minimum of 1\/2 hour.\nA request for an alternative schedule (i.e., other than 8:30 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. with one hour lunch) must be discussed and confirmed in writing with an individual's supervisor and\/or the faculty member(s) and others who are directly affected by the individual's work.\nThe individual selecting an alternative schedule must see that at least one other person is available to handle issues that arise during his or her absence.\nHours actually worked must be recorded on each non-exempt employee's Attendance\/Exception Hours Report Form.\nStaff members in their first six months in a new job may expect to be asked to work the standard 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. schedule to assure appropriate training and interaction with others in the department.\nFlexible working hours are not available to bargaining unit employees unless it is so stated in the governing labor agreement.\n\nExamples of alternative schedules are given on the attached diagram\u00a0[PDF].\nQuestions About Flexible Working Hours\nIf you have questions or comments about the implementation of flexible working hours, you can contact your Human Resources representative.\n\u00a0\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Specific questions about policy content should be directed to the Controller's Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\nPetty Cash Reimbursement Form\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nCarnegie Mellon University permits departments to maintain a petty cash fund, as described by this policy.\nDepartments are responsible for adequate security and control of their petty cash funds. The fund should be secured at all times in a locked place. Because no insurance is available to cover losses from the fund, theft and any other losses of petty cash are the responsibility of the department\/college.\nPurpose and Use\nPetty cash can be used to reimburse individuals for non-travel, out-of-pocket expenditures. Petty cash can sometimes be used in place of the university purchasing process where appropriate, for example, as reimbursement for small, incidental department expenses when it is infeasible or impractical to use normal purchasing means. Petty cash should be used in this manner only when absolutely necessary. A petty cash fund can also be used as a \"change fund\" in the department for handling ticket sales, etc., where expenses are not incurred.\nProhibitions\nPetty cash should not be used for the following:\n\nTravel expense reimbursements;\nTravel advances;\nPayment for items that are to be purchased through the purchasing system according to the university purchasing policy;\nPayments to vendors for invoices submitted directly to the department where a mini-order or purchase order was issued;\u00a0\nPayments to independent contractors, consultants, awards, etc., to non-university employees;\u00a0\nPayments to employees for services, awards, bonuses, etc.;\u00a0\nPayments of a taxable or non-taxable benefit to an individual;\u00a0\nPayments to university service centers (e.g., Bookstore, etc.);\u00a0\nSales tax on purchasing;\nPersonal borrowing.\n\nInitiating a Petty Cash Fund\nA staff or faculty member, in coordination with the business manager of that department, should send an email to the Controller's Office. The email must detail the purpose and use of the fund, identify the custodian and their supervisor, and request an amount for which the fund will be established. The dollar limit for each use of the fund is set at the department's discretion, between $25 and $300, though individual department circumstances may dictate a need for a higher limit. In all cases, the Controller's Office will review each request for appropriateness based on documentation provided at the time of the request.\nPetty Cash Custodian\nAppointment\nThe petty cash fund should be secured at all times. The department is responsible to appoint a custodian, who is a member of the faculty or staff, to monitor its use and replenishment. Appointment and approval should be made by the department's business manager or higher; a custodian cannot appoint or approve himself\/herself. In addition, there should be limited access to the fund.\nThe Controller's Office must be notified if there is a change in the petty cash custodian. In order to ensure accountability to the new custodian, the Controller's Office will audit and document the fund at the time of the change.\nResponsibilities\nIt will be the responsibility of the custodian to ensure that this fund is used to cover only those expense reimbursements for which it is not possible, or is infeasible, to use normal purchasing methods such as the University Purchasing Card or purchase order. In addition, the custodian will ensure that fund use is consistent with the manner described in the documentation that initially established the fund. The petty cash custodian is also responsible to enforce university policy regarding sales tax, which is not reimbursable.\nThe custodian is responsible to perform a full reconciliation of the fund at least quarterly, which he\/she will provide to the Controller's Office. The custodian also handles fund replenishment (see the section on Reimbursement Process, below).\nThe custodian is responsible for reporting all instances of loss of funds, including filing a report with Campus Police, as soon as the loss is discovered.\nDocumentation\nProperly document each transaction in the following manner:\n\nSubmit a detailed journal of all transactions, identifying all pertinent information (who, purpose, transaction detail and date of expense). Identify each cost and Oracle to be charged.\nTape original receipts onto an 8-1\/2x11 sheet, referencing each receipt's corresponding transaction on the detailed journal.\nSubmit a summary page that shows only the total amount charged to each center\/account code. This data will be the basis for entry of transaction detail in the Oracle Financials System.\n\nIt is important to remember that it will be the custodian's responsibility to determine whether an expenditure is allowable as a direct research cost (where applicable) or indirect cost (based on purpose, receipts, general research restrictions) and to use the proper account codes for unallowable costs as appropriate.\nReimbursement Process\nWhen the fund is reduced to a balance that can support approximately 5-7 business days of activity, the custodian should perform a reconciliation and send it, along with a request to replenish the fund, to the petty cash coordinator to the Controller's Office. Before being submitted, this reimbursement request must be approved by the immediate supervisor of the fund custodian. The Controller's Office will audit the request to ensure that proper documentation (as described in the Documentation section, above) has been provided. It should be further noted that reimbursements will not be made for the items detailed in the prohibitions section.\nOnce the audit is completed and the reimbursement request approved, a check will be prepared for fund replenishment.\u00a0\nChanging the Fund Amount\nIf there is a situation where it is determined that the size of the petty cash fund should be increased or decreased, an email should be forwarded to the Controller's Office requesting this change. This should be done prior to requesting a replenishment of funds. An increase to a petty cash fund is subject to the approval of Controller's Office, as well as the department business manager, similar to when the fund is initially established.\nClosing a Petty Cash Account\nThe petty cash fund should be closed with the Controller's Office when the purpose for which the fund was established has been completed, as determined by either the department business manager or the petty cash custodian. In addition, the Controller's Office reserves the right to conduct periodic usage reviews and, based on the results, can request closure or reduction of the fund. When closing the fund, the custodian should deposit all remaining funds at Cash Operations, completing a Financial Services receipt form, and being sure to credit the petty cash account. Along with the final reconciliation of expenses, this will relieve the balance in the petty cash fund as established for this use. The final reconciliation of funds and expenses must be provided to the Controller's Office, including the copy of the Financial Services receipt form containing the Cash Operations date stamp.\nAudit\nPetty cash accounts will be subject to audit by the Controller's Office. In addition, the University Services will perform periodic unannounced audits of the fund to ensure proper control is maintained.\nThe department is required to provide the Controller's Office with a full reconciliation of the fund on, at minimum, a quarterly basis. This can be done as part of the request for reimbursement process (see above) but must be done at least quarterly.\n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Accordingly, the university will make every attempt to operate normally during severe weather or other emergencies. This includes holding classes, conducting research programs, and operating facilities and services. The university will attempt to operate normally unless such operation represents a clear threat to the health and safety of students, staff, faculty, and visitors.There may be occasions when the university community is served best by suspending normal operations. In that event, only the president (or the president's designated representative) has the authority to close the university and to specify those persons or group of persons who are to refrain from coming to campus and\/or who are free to leave work or class early.\u00a0 Staff members who provide essential services, such as certain members of\u00a0 Campus Operations (including Emergency Management, Facilities Management and Campus Services, Computing Services, and University Police)\u00a0 and Student Affairs (including Dining Services, Housing Services, etc.)\u00a0 may be required to work.\nStandard Operations\nUnless the president announces that the university is closed, everyone is expected to be at work as usual. When the university is in session, faculty members are expected to meet their scheduled classes and other obligations. If a faculty member is unable to meet a scheduled class, he or she should notify the department office and arrange for either a qualified substitute or a future make-up session.If the university is open but a staff member is unable to come to work because of severe weather or other emergency, the staff member should notify the supervisor as soon as possible. Staff members will be expected to use Paid Time Off (PTO), consistent with regular operating protocols.\nAnnouncement of Closing\nAs soon as the president or the designee determines that the university must be closed due to an emergency, announcements of the closing will be issued via Carnegie Mellon email, the university\u2019s emergency alert system, and posted to the CMU homepage. Media Relations staff may also inform local media organizations about the closing.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

For general questions about policy content, as well as specific information about financial aid, contact The HUB, ext. 8-8186.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nUniversity Academic Scholarship Renewals\nCarnegie Mellon University awards academic scholarships as part of the freshman financial aid process. Each of these scholarships is renewable for four academic years of study (five for architecture) based upon the maintenance of a specific cumulative quality point average. The academic scholarship renewal criteria are included in the scholarship notification letter which is mailed to the student prior to the May 1 matriculation deadline.\nEach scholarship recipient's cumulative quality point average is reviewed at the end of each academic year. If the student achieves the scholarship renewal criteria, then the scholarship is automatically renewed for the next academic year.\nIf the student does not meet the cumulative quality point average requirement for renewal, then s\/he is given the opportunity to appeal. A merit scholarship appeal form and instructions are automatically sent to the student at the end of each academic year.\nThe student's completed appeal form is reviewed by members of the Enrollment Services staff. Input from the Associate Dean of the student's college is also considered. The student is notified, in writing, of the decision. The decision may be to renew the scholarship for the entire academic year, renew the scholarship for one academic term, or to reject the appeal. If the appeal is rejected, a written explanation is provided to the student.\nUndergraduate Tuition Exchange Programs\nCarnegie Mellon University assesses the standard tuition charge for the undergraduate tuition exchange programs.\nSince Carnegie Mellon assesses the tuition charge, the student can be considered for all forms of institutional, state, and federal aid for which the student may have eligibility with the exception of any student employment program.\nUndergraduate Study Abroad Programs\nCarnegie Mellon University does not assess the tuition charge for any of the Study Abroad Programs.\nSince Carnegie Mellon does not assess the tuition charge, the student is not considered for any institutional grants and scholarships. However, Carnegie Mellon will consider any student participating in an approved Study Abroad Program for all state and federal student aid programs for which the student may have eligibility with the exception of any student employment program.\nThe U.S. Department of Education and Carnegie Mellon University define an approved Study Abroad Program as one which is part of a contractual agreement between Carnegie Mellon and the host institution. Additionally, courses taken in the Study Abroad Program must be accepted for transfer to Carnegie Mellon by the Dean of the student's college.\nUndergraduate International Students\nFor purposes of undergraduate student financial aid, an International Student is defined as someone who is neither a U.S. citizen nor an eligible noncitizen. The U.S. Department of Education defines an eligible noncitizen as:\n\nAn individual who is a permanent resident of the United States (as evidenced by an I-151 or I-551 card); or\nAn individual who can provide documentation from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that s\/he is in the United States for other than a temporary purpose with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.\n\nAn undergraduate, International Student is ineligible to receive any federal or state student financial aid. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon does not award any institutional financial aid funds to undergraduate International Students.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

The prohibition of deadly weapons on campus is a proactive step toward reducing the risk of injury or death due to the intentional, accidental, inexpert or improper use of firearms. \nStatement\nDeadly weapons are not permitted on any property owned or controlled by the university.\nFor the purposes of this policy, a deadly weapon is any device designed to produce death or serious bodily injury. Deadly weapons include, but are not limited to:\n\nFirearms, whether loaded or unloaded\nPellet, flare, tranquilizer, stun, spear and dart guns\nKnives with blades larger than that of a folding pocket knife.\nSwitchblades\nDaggers\nStriking instruments, including clubs, truncheons, blackjacks, metal knuckles and sap gloves\nMartial arts weapons, including nunchakus, tonfas, staffs and throwing stars\nBow and arrow combinations\nExplosive devices, including hand grenades, bombs, black powder, smokeless powder, percussion caps, friction primers and pyrotechnic fuses.\n\nThe definition of deadly weapons under this policy does not include devices such as commercially available aerosol dispensers of non-lethal chemical irritants, pocket knives or general tools not designed as weapons.\nThis prohibition against deadly weapons applies equally to those carried by persons with a government-issued permit or license. The only exceptions to this policy are those listed below.\nExceptions\nThis policy does not apply to:\n\nCommissioned Carnegie Mellon police officers\nOther duly-appointed law enforcement officers\nMembers of the United States armed forces when on duty\nAny trained security personnel when approved in advance by the Chief of Police or his designee.\n\nIt is recognized that there may be activities related to the educational mission of the university (e.g., physical fitness activities or theatrical productions) that may appear to violate the letter but not the intent of this policy. In such cases, the department or organization coordinating the activity is responsible for obtaining written approval from the Chief of Police or his designee, in advance, to conduct the activity. Such approval may extend for up to one year at a time.\nViolations\nPersons who possess deadly weapons in violation of this policy will be required by University Police to remove the weapons and\/or themselves from university property.\nAny university student, faculty or staff member who violates this policy shall be subject to action in accordance with university disciplinary policies and procedures for students, faculty and staff. Further, possession of a deadly weapon in violation of federal, state or local laws will be referred to University Police or other appropriate law enforcement authorities and may result in legal sanctions.\nCall University Police at ext. 8-2327 to report violations or suspected violations of this policy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions about policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\nPolicy on Faculty Leaves\n\n\nRELATED FORM:\nApplication for Faculty Public Service Leaves [PDF]\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nMembers of the regular faculty are sometimes called upon to take a position in government or to perform some other form of public service that requires a temporary interruption of their normal activities in the university. In many instances they are encouraged to accept such commitments because they could improve their professional competence when they return to the university. Such public service is also a contribution the university community can make by lending the expertise of its members to improving the public welfare.\nLeaves for public service will be granted on the same basis and by the same procedure as other professional leaves supported by outside funds except that, if the nature of the public service contemplated requires it, such a leave may be granted (a) for two years (instead of one year at a time) and (b) without regard to calendar deadlines for applying. For state and federal elective office and for major political appointments (e.g., cabinet or sub-cabinet positions), requests for extension of the leave for a total period of up to four years will be considered.\nExtensions beyond four years require exceptional justification and explicit consideration and approval by the president.\nWhen a person holding a regular faculty appointment without indefinite tenure requests a leave for public service, he or she may request the exclusion from current service for the purpose of determining the tenure decision deadline (\"stopping the tenure clock\") of a period of time not exceeding the duration of the leave. If the aggregate of the requested exclusion and any earlier exclusions from current service for reasons of public service does not exceed two twelve-month years, the requested exclusion shall be automatically granted when the requested leave is approved by the provost. If the cited aggregate exceeds two twelve-month years, the provost may grant the requested exclusion after receiving recommendations from the dean of the college or school and from a college or school committee (e.g., a promotions review committee) with substantial faculty participation. In no case may the aggregate exclusion from current service for reasons of public service exceed four twelve-month years.\nThe university is committed to making all decisions under these provisions with care to avoid actual or perceived political bias or discrimination.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on Policy content should be directed to University Police at 412-268-6232.\n\n\n\n\n\nThreats or acts of violence will not be tolerated on property owned or controlled by the university.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICY:\n\n\nPolicy on Deadly Weapons\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nCarnegie Mellon University is committed to maintaining a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors. Threats or acts of violence against anyone on property owned or controlled by the university will not be tolerated. Such behavior may result in criminal arrest and prosecution and\/or disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, against the perpetrators whether they are students, faculty or staff.\nDealing With Threats and Violence\nIndividuals should notify University Police, 412-268-2323, of any threats or violent behavior that have occurred, particularly threats or behavior they have witnessed or been subject to. Such behavior should be reported regardless of the personal or professional relationship between the apparent perpetrator and victim.\nAny person who makes threats or engages in violent behavior while on property owned or controlled by the university may be removed from the premises as quickly as safety permits. They may be required to remain off university premises pending the outcome of an investigation. Any university student, faculty or staff member who violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with university policies and procedures applicable to students, faculty and staff.\nIt is recognized that there may be activities related to the educational mission of the university (e.g., physical fitness activities or theatrical productions) that may appear to violate the letter but not the intent of this Policy. In such cases, the department or organization coordinating the activity is responsible for obtaining written approval from the Chief of Police or his designee, in advance, to conduct the activity. Such approval may extend for up to one year at a time.\nInternal Sanctions\nAppropriate internal sanctions may be imposed for violation of this policy. The sanctions will depend on the circumstances and gravity of the violation, and may range from reprimand to dismissal, expulsion or termination.The decision to impose sanctions and procedures for imposing them shall conform as follows:\n\nIn the case of regular, research or special faculty or lecturer-track appointees, to the provisions of the section on Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions of the Carnegie Mellon Appointment and Tenure Policy (except that action regarding such a person's administrative appointments is at the discretion of the president).\nIn the case of undergraduate, graduate or special students, to the provisions of the section on Community Standards in the Student Handbook.\nIn the case of staff, to the provisions of the section on Staff Relations in the Staff Handbook, unless superseded by the provisions of an applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n\nProtection From Abuse\/Restraining Orders\nAll individuals who apply for or obtain a temporary or permanent Protection From Abuse Order or Restraining Order listing any Carnegie Mellon University location as a protected area must provide University Police with a copy of the order. The University Police Department understands the sensitivity of this information and respects the privacy of the reporting person. Procedures are in place to maintain the confidentiality of the information.\nOther Campus Resources\nThe following additional contacts are available to members of the campus community who have questions or concerns about threats or violent behavior on university premises. These contacts can provide information about established guidelines and procedures for dealing with and preventing threats and violent behavior. In the exercise of their function, these contacts will maintain the greatest degree of confidentiality consistent with their responsibilities as university representatives.\n\nDirector, Human Resource Services:\u00a0 412-268-5081\nVice President and Dean, Office of Student Affairs: 412-268-2075\nAssociate Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer:\u00a0 412-268-3785\nDirector, Counseling and Psychological Services:\u00a0 412-268-2922\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It also serves as a guide for prospective donors and their advisors, providing assurance that all donors are treated equitably.\n\n\n\nDefinitions\nn\/a\n\n\nForms \/ Instructions\nn\/a\n\n\nRelated Information\nArtistic Properties Collection Policy Naming Gifts Policy Public Art Policy Real Estate Gift Acceptance Policy Signature Authority for Legally Binding Commitments and Documents\n\n\nReason for Policy \/ Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the Gift Acceptance, Counting, and Reporting policy is to provide a set of standards by which gifts are reviewed, accepted, recorded, and receipted by Carnegie Mellon University. The policy applies to all gifts of private support received by the university, including units, programs, and centers. This policy focuses on Advancement reporting, not financial accounting and reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrintable Version\n\nPrintable, searchable version. [PDF]\n\n\n\n\nI. Introduction\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nIntroduction\nThe responsibilities for fundraising are shared among Carnegie Mellon University administrators, deans, and University Advancement staff. All fundraising and constituent engagement activities on behalf of the university must be aligned with strategic priorities and comply with local, state, and federal laws and with university policies.\nThe university is committed to ethical engagement. All solicitations on behalf of the university or any unit or program will be in accordance with the standards in the Donor Bill of Rights, as developed by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) and other national organizations. A copy of the Donor Bill of Rights is available on the university website.\n\n\n\nII. What is a Gift?\n\n\nA gift is defined as a complete voluntary transfer of assets from a person or an organization to the university where no goods or services are expected, implied, or forthcoming in return to the donor. Gifts usually take the form of cash, securities, real property, or personal property. The following criteria generally identify a gift:\nGifts are motivated by philanthropic intent.\nGifts are transfers of assets to the university\u2019s control. The university is not obliged to return unexpended funds.\nGifts are not generally subject to an exchange of consideration or other contractual duties between the university and the donor, except for certain planned gifts as outlined in this policy, although objectives may be stated and funds may be restricted to specific purposes.\nThe donor may make a restricted-use gift by designating a specific purpose. The donor may also designate a gift for unrestricted use by the university or a particular college, school, department, or unit.\nGenerally, funds received from individuals, closely held corporations, and family foundations will be classified as gifts. Funds received from foundations, corporations, and corporate foundations will be classified as gifts unless they require performance or other considerations that may result in their being designated as sponsored research.\n\nThe university is guided by standards set forth by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) when questions of whether or not a particular transfer of assets counts as a gift.\n\n\nIII. Qualification and Registration\n\n\nThe university is a nonprofit organization as described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, the university qualifies under both federal and state law as a tax-exempt public organization in which charitable contributions are deductible to the full extent of the law for income, gift, and estate tax purposes.\nThe university's federal tax identification number is 25-0969449.\n\n\nIV. Gift Acceptance\n\n\nThe university will make every effort to accommodate and accept all charitable contributions from donors. However, it will not accept gifts that:\nViolate the terms of this Policy;\nViolate a federal, state, or other law;\nAre too difficult or expensive to administer;\nCould create unacceptable liability or cause the university to incur future unanticipated or anticipated expenses;\nAre for purposes that do not further the university\u2019s mission;\nCould damage the reputation of the university;\nWould jeopardize the university's tax-exempt status; or\nProvide a donor with goods or services of financial value in exchange for the donor\u2019s gift, unless such value is fully disclosed in the time and manner as required under federal and state law and regulations.\n\nIf a gift falls into one of the above categories, the gift officer working with the donor will consult with the Vice President for University Advancement, who will make a final decision regarding gift acceptance, in consultation with the President as necessary.\n\n\nV. Gift Designation and Restrictions\n\n\nAll gifts must be directed to a specific gift fund in University Advancement\u2019s database of record. The choice of fund will be consistent with the written directions of the donor, which will be archived as substantiation. See Article VI below for information about gift agreements.\nA donor may designate both the university recipient (e.g., a specific school, department, or program) as the beneficiary of a gift and a purpose (e.g., scholarship, fellowship, professorship, etc.) for which the gift is to be used.\nIf the donor does not designate a specific university recipient or purpose of a gift, the gift will be designated \u201cunrestricted\u201d by University Advancement. As necessary, the Vice President for University Advancement will consult with the President and decide how the gift will be used by the university.\nIf the donor designates a specific university recipient but not a specific purpose, the gift will be added to the university recipient\u2019s general gift fund, or such other fund as directed by the person responsible for spending gifts to the university recipient.\nIf the donor designates a specific purpose for a gift, the university will either add this restricted gift to a currently existing fund with the same purpose or create a new fund for the specified purpose, as appropriate.\n\nPlease see the Naming Gifts Policy for information regarding naming gifts.\n\n\nVI. Gift Agreements\n\n\nGeneral Information\nA gift agreement documents the mutual understanding between a donor and the university in relation to the donor\u2019s charitable contribution. A formal gift agreement is generally required for new obligations entered into by the university, both for multi-year commitments and outright gifts of $20,000 or more. Examples include, but are not limited to: new endowed funds; new and\/or newly named physical spaces (e.g., building, facility, or portion thereof); and new and\/or newly named academic units, programs, or centers. In general, the terms of any gift should be as flexible as possible to permit the most productive use of the funds over time, while clearly stating the intent of the donor.\nInformation appearing in a gift agreement includes, but is not limited to: the dollar amount of the charitable gift\/pledge; any restrictions on gift designation and\/or use; pledge payment schedule; and recognition, as well as any other requirements or obligations agreed upon by the donor and the university.\nGifts\/pledges that are not documented by formal gift agreement generally need to be documented in some other way. For gifts of less than $20,000, a signed letter of intent or university gift\/pledge form is generally sufficient documentation. The university will provide donors with a letter of intent template or gift\/pledge form, as appropriate, in those cases. When adding to an existing fund, no specifications on how the money will be spent can be made.\nThe Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with the President and the Vice President and General Counsel, as necessary, will make final decisions on all questions related to university gift agreements and requests for special exceptions.\n\nGift Agreement Drafting\nUniversity gift officers draft gift agreements using templates approved by the Vice President for University Advancement and the university\u2019s Office of the General Counsel. Gift officers are not permitted to make any material changes to those templates without the permission of the Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, and such permission will only be granted in rare circumstances. Questions related to gift agreement templates should first be directed to a designated representative of the university\u2019s Advancement Programs and Services Office (\u201cAdvancement Services Office\u201d).\nIn cases where a substantive deviation from a university gift agreement template is requested by a donor, or a template does not exist for a particular gift, the gift officer working with the donor must consult with a designated representative of the university\u2019s Advancement Services Office. A representative of that office will assist the gift officer in determining whether the gift meets university requirements for acceptance and, if it does, provide assistance in drafting a university-approved gift agreement document. Any deviation from the standard gift agreement templates must be approved by the Vice President for University Advancement, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel.\nA signed award letter from a foundation or corporation is an acceptable form of gift documentation if it accepts the terms of the original proposal in total and\/or documents restrictions on the gift\u2019s designation, use, reporting requirements, giving vehicle, contribution schedule, recognition, and\/or other obligations agreed upon by the foundation or corporation and the university. If available, the gift award proposal and other documentation submitted to the foundation or corporation clarifying the use of the gift must also be attached to the gift record.\nWills, trusts, or other estate planning documents are acceptable forms of gift documentation. However, to help ensure the donor\u2019s philanthropic intent is fully realized, the university\u2019s Office of Gift Planning recommends that the donor also have a signed gift agreement or gift confirmation form on file with the university.\nThere will be occasions where fundraising has been approved for an initiative where there is no lead donor. Examples of this include class gifts and university crowdfunding efforts, among others. In these circumstances, internal functional fund agreements (FFAs) will be drafted by the university\u2019s Advancement Services Office and approved and signed by the Vice President for University Advancement or his\/her designee. The purpose of the FFA is to document the fund\u2019s purpose, fundraising requirements and deadlines, alternative uses if required gift minimums are not reached, restrictions on gift designation and\/or use, and recognition, as well as any other requirements or obligations.\nIn accordance with the university's commitment to non-discrimination, gift agreement language will never discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.\n\nPledge Payments\nPledge payment periods may be up to five consecutive years, with the first payment scheduled within one year of the date of the gift agreement\u2019s execution. Exceptions to this guideline must be granted by the Vice President for University Advancement.\nPledges from individual donors that are likely to be paid in full or part through either a donor-advised fund or private family foundation must be written in the form of a non-binding statement of intention in order to prevent the donor, foundation, or donor-advised fund from potentially violating certain provisions against self-dealing under the federal tax laws. Approved text for these circumstances exists within University Advancement\u2019s gift agreement templates.\nCorporate matching gifts cannot be applied as pledge payments to an individual\u2019s personal pledge commitment.\n\nGift Agreement Signatures\nPrior to obtaining any university or donor signatures, an identical gift agreement draft must be approved by all signers. Gift agreements that conform to approved university gift agreement templates do not need further approval from the Vice President for University Advancement prior to signature.\nGift agreement signing authority is designated by the university President. In general, the Vice President for University Advancement is the university officer with authority to commit the university to gift agreements. The university President and other university officials with the authority to commit the university to agreements (e.g., Provost and Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer) or their approved designees may serve as lead signers under special circumstances. See also the university policy on \u201cSignature Authority for Legally Binding Commitments and Documents\u201d (see Related Information)\nUniversity deans and other university leaders will be asked to sign gift agreements, in a non-binding capacity, when gifts benefit their areas of oversight, and to support donor stewardship.\nExcept in cases where signature from the university\u2019s Office of Sponsored Programs is required, the Vice President for University Advancement or his\/her designee will sign corporate and foundation award letters for the university, in consultation with university leadership involved with and\/or affected by those gifts, as well as the university\u2019s Office of the General Counsel and Office of Finance as needed.\n\nDistribution and Storage of Fully Executed Gift Agreements\nIn general, two original copies of the gift agreement will be prepared for signing: one for the donor\u2019s records, and one for the university\u2019s records. The university will also accept electronic copies of fully executed gift agreements.\nThe university\u2019s original copy and\/or an electronic copy of the fully executed gift agreement will be stored securely by the university\u2019s Advancement Services Office.\n\n\n\nVII. Transferring Assets and Specific Types of Gift Assets\n\n\nFor appropriate methods of transferring different types of assets, please reference the \u201cWays to Give\u201d published account on the CMU web site.\nThe university will accept gifts of cash, marketable securities, non-marketable securities, real estate, and gifts of tangible or intangible personal property (gifts-in-kind).\nCash Gifts\nOutright cash gifts can take the form of checks, credit cards, wire transfers, or payroll deductions.\nCash gifts are credited to the donor\u2019s giving record at actual cash value.\nCash may be delivered in person, by mail, by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), or by wire transfer.\nCash gifts are complete on the date the cash is physically transferred to a representative of the university, and will be reported by University Advancement on the date the cash is processed by the Office of Gift Administration.\nGifts of foreign currency will be valued at the U.S. dollar equivalent on the date the gift is received.\nUniversity payroll deductions can be set up through the Office of Gift Administration.\nRecurring credit card payments can be set up online.\n\nMarketable Securities (Stocks and Bonds)\nThe Treasurer\u2019s Office works with the Office of Gift Administration on the acceptance of all gifts of marketable securities.\nThe university\u2019s preferred broker provides the value of the gift by using an average of the high and low trading price on the date of the gift. In the event that a marketable security gift comes to the university via a broker other than the university\u2019s preferred broker, the Treasurer\u2019s Office will provide the value of the gift to the Office of Gift Administration by calculating the average of the high and low trading price on the date of the gift.\nIn most cases, gifts of marketable securities will be sold in due course in accordance with established university practice. It is the university\u2019s practice to dispose of marketable securities as expeditiously as possible.\nThe Treasurer\u2019s Office must approve any request by a donor that CMU hold and refrain from selling a marketable security. Marketable security gifts are sold as soon as reasonably possible to reduce the impact of any gain or loss on the transaction.\nThe Office of Gift Administration will issue a gift receipt reflecting the value of the shares on the date of the gift, as well as a description of the securities received.\nGifts of mutual fund shares are also acceptable. Transfers of this type may take longer to complete, and the date of the gift will be determined by the date of receipt by the university.\nIn cases where a stock gift is submitted to pay off a documented commitment, realized funds in excess of that commitment will be allocated to the same purpose and booked as an outright gift.\n\nNon-marketable or Closely-Held Securities\nThese securities include: partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, closely-held companies, stock of entities that fall under SEC Rule 144, legend stock or bonds of entities that are thinly traded, and stock of entities held for sale at the request of a donor.\nThe Treasurer\u2019s Office, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, the Vice President for University Advancement, the Office of Gift Planning, and the Chief Investment Officer, coordinates acceptance of all gifts of non-marketable or closely-held securities and should be notified prior to the acceptance of any such gifts. Because of the unique nature of these securities, special due diligence review will be required prior to acceptance.\nThe value of these securities as reported by University Advancement will be determined based on the fair market value of the securities on the date of gift, using an appraisal or alternative method of valuation acceptable to the Office of General Council and the Vice President for University Advancement.\n\nReal Estate\nThe university may accept gifts of many types of real estate, such as residential, commercial, apartment buildings, vacation properties, and undeveloped land.\nFor further information, please see the Real Estate Gift Acceptance Policy.\n\nBargain Sales\nIn limited circumstances, the university may purchase an asset for less than its fair market value. This bargain sale results in a gift from the owner of the property in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value and the purchase price by the university.\nThe Office of Gift Planning will coordinate the due diligence review process on bargain sales along with the appropriate university offices.\nThe university will generally not pay more than 50% of the fair market value of an asset when participating in a bargain sale.\n\nGifts of Tangible and Intangible Personal Property (Gifts-in-Kind)\nThe university may accept gifts of many types of tangible and intangible personal property. Examples of gifts of tangible personal property include, but are not limited to: automobiles, boats, art, jewelry, furniture, antiques, rare books, manuscripts, and lab equipment. Examples of gifts of intangible personal property include, but are not limited to: computer software, royalties, patents, and copyrights.\nThe Gift Administration department, in consultation with the Office of Gift Planning and the Office of Property Accounting, are responsible for conducting due diligence review on, and approving the acceptance of, all gifts of tangible personal property.\nGifts of artwork are the subject of separate university Policies on Artistic Properties Collection and Public Art available on the university website.\nBefore recording a gift-in-kind, the university is required to obtain documentation from the donor stating that the gift has been given to the university and will not be required to be returned. Typical documentation includes: a signed and dated letter from the donor acknowledging the gift, including fair market value (FMV); a full description of the item; a completed and signed IRS Form 8283 (for gifts with a FMV of $5,000 or more); and a completed appraisal from a qualified outside appraiser.\nAll gifts of software or licensing must be coordinated through the Office of Institutional Partnerships. Though useful and appreciated, generally gifts of software licenses are not countable as charitable donations as they are considered partial interests by the IRS. To be considered a charitable donation, software must be irrevocably transferred to the University (not limited or licensed) with no restrictions, no expiration nor requirement of renewal, no implicit or explicit exchange or purchase of services, nor any provisions to share exclusive information.\nInformation about any gift of tangible\/intangible personal property should be forwarded to the Office of Gift Administration, which will credit the donor and prepare an appropriate gift receipt. The receipt issued to the donor for a gift of personal property will not show a value for the property. The receipt will describe the property received, and the donor\u2019s giving record will be hard credited with the estimated fair market value of the item. It is the responsibility of the donor to determine the value of a gift of personal property for tax purposes.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has specific reporting requirements for the disposal of property received as gifts. Specifically, gifts valued at $5,000 or more, which are disposed of within three years of the date of the gift, are subject to reporting to the IRS on Form 8282.\nIf there is any question about the acceptability of a potential gift of tangible personal property, the Vice President for University Advancement should be consulted before proceeding.\nGifts-in-kind of services include such activities as printing of materials, appraisals, and design work, among others. These services provide valuable support to the university. However, the contribution of services, no matter how valuable, is not tax deductible according to the IRS. Therefore, University Advancement does not record hard or soft credit for donors of such gifts.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. Employer-sponsored Matching Gifts\n\n\nA matching gift may be received from a company or a company funded foundation, matching a gift given to the university by an employee, retired employee, a director of the company, or sometimes the spouse of the employed individual.\nMatching gifts will be credited to the same account(s) in University Advancement\u2019s database of record as the original gift unless restricted by the matching company.\nMatching gifts cannot be entered as a payment on a personal pledge made by an individual, as the funds are not under direct control of the donor.\n\n\nIX. Donor Advised Funds\n\n\nDonor Advised Funds (DAFs) are philanthropic vehicles established at public charities that allow donors to make charitable contributions, receive immediate tax benefits, and then recommend grants from the funds over time.\nGifts to the university from DAFs are typically accepted in the form of checks or electronic fund transfers and processed accordingly.\nNo gift receipt will be issued to the individual who recommended a university gift to the DAF; however, the individual\u2019s giving record will be soft credited with the value of the gift.\nGifts to the university from DAFs cannot be used to make payments on personal pledges of the individuals who made the gift recommendations to their DAFs.\n\n\nX. Planned Gifts\n\nPlanned gifts will be utilized by the university at some point in the future. These gifts are either irrevocable (cannot be changed by the donor once the gift is made) or revocable (can be changed by the donor at any time). The university\u2019s Office of Gift Planning oversees the university\u2019s planned giving programs, including the creation of life income gifts, in consultation with the Investment Office, the Treasurer\u2019s Office, and the Office of the General Counsel as needed. The Office of Gift Planning is also responsible for due diligence review with respect to all planned gifts. A range of planned giving options is available at the university.\n\nCharitable Gift Annuities\nA charitable gift annuity provides fixed payments to one or two annuitants for life in exchange for a gift of cash or securities to the university. The payments are backed by the general resources of the university. Upon the death of the annuitant(s), the residuum of the annuity will be used by the university as directed by the donor.\nThe university may accept charitable gift annuities, in compliance with certain legal requirements and other considerations.\nThe university sets required gift minimums to establish gift annuities.\nThe university will follow the gift annuity rates suggested by the American Council on Gift Annuities (ACGA). However, for ages where the suggested ACGA rate is significantly higher than the rate of return on the university\u2019s gift annuity pool, donors may be asked to accept a rate lower than the suggested ACGA rate in order to maximize the residuum.\n\nCharitable Remainder Trusts\nA charitable remainder trust provides payments for either the life of the beneficiary or for a set period of time. The trust payments are either the same amount each year for a charitable remainder annuity trust, or, for a charitable remainder unitrust, the payments will fluctuate from year to year based on the value of the trust\u2019s assets. When the trust term ends, its remaining assets are transferred to the university for use as directed by the donor.\nThe university may accept gifts of a remainder interest in charitable remainder trusts.\nThe university may serve as trustee of a charitable remainder trust, provided it is named irrevocably as a beneficiary of at least 50% of the remainder, and that the university\u2019s required minimum value of the trust is met.\n\nCharitable Lead Trusts\nA charitable lead trust provides annual payments to the university over a set period of time. The remaining trust assets are transferred at the end of the trust term to the donor or whomever the donor chooses.\nThe university may accept designation as the beneficiary of a charitable lead trust.\nDue to the potential for liability, the university may accept an appointment as trustee of a charitable lead trust only upon review of all relevant circumstances and approval by the Vice President for University Advancement, the university Treasurer, the Chief Investment Officer, and the Office of the General Counsel.\n\nLife Insurance\nThe university may accept a designation as beneficiary or owner of a life insurance policy.\nThe university will not accept policies where the university is obligated to make any future premium payments unless the donor commits to making annual gifts to cover such payments and\/or understands that the university may unilaterally exercise its right to surrender the policy for its cash surrender value.\nThe university sets required face value minimums on life insurance policies.\n\nBequest Intentions\nThe university will accept and retain documentation of bequest intentions regardless of revocability or the age of the donor.\nThe Office of Gift Planning is responsible for developing guidelines on how such intentions will be counted and recognized in University Advancement\u2019s database of record based on factors such as the revocability of the gift and the age of the donor.\n\n\n\nXI. Gift Entry Receipts\n\n\nAll philanthropic commitments to the university must be processed by and credited to the donor through the University Advancement gift processing and data management system.\nIRS regulations require the university to issue a written receipt to every donor who makes a gift valued at $250 or more. The Office of Gift Administration in University Advancement will provide donors to the university a gift receipt that is prepared in accordance with applicable government requirements. No other university department\/unit should issue a gift receipt.\nGift Administration must have, at a minimum, the following information to record a gift and issue a receipt:\nName of the donor(s)\nAddress of the donor(s)\nDate of the gift\nDescription of the gift property\n\nIn addition to a tax receipt, gifts of certain types and levels will also be acknowledged with thank-you communications (e.g., letter, phone call, or other means).\nThe university does not record unreimbursed expenses incurred by volunteers as gifts. University Advancement will provide a letter acknowledging a person\u2019s volunteer role, with dates of service, and with a statement that expenses might have been incurred that were not reimbursed and might be tax deductible.\n\n\nXII. Gifts from CMU Faculty and Staff\n\nThe university is grateful for gifts from faculty and staff members. Due to IRS regulations, in order for a gift to qualify for a charitable deduction, the donor must not directly benefit from or control the use of the funds. As such, university faculty and staff members cannot designate a gift to a fund that:\n\nSupports his or her salary;\nPays for consumer goods to be used by him or her;\nPays for travel by him or her; or\nProvides scholarship or fellowship assistance to him or her, or to a close relative.\n\n\nXIII. Providing Legal or Financial Advice\n\n\nNeither the university nor any of its employees acting on behalf of the university may agree to act as the successor trustee of a living trust or the executor of any will in which the university is named as a beneficiary, without the approval of the Vice President for University Advancement.\nUniversity employees acting on behalf of the university shall not draft wills or living trusts naming the university as a beneficiary, regardless of whether such employee is licensed to practice law. (This provision does not apply to employees drafting their own will or wills for family members, naming the university as a beneficiary.)\nUniversity employees may provide donors with suggested bequest language or assistance with other language pertaining to gift designation within the university.\nThe Office of Gift Planning may provide donors and their counsel with approved form documents for planned gifts such as charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, and life estates.\nNo employee of the university shall provide financial planning services for any donor. Prospective donors should be encouraged to seek the assistance of their own financial advisors in matters relating to their gifts and the resulting tax and estate planning consequences. Further, to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of improper influence, the university shall not pay legal or other fees for the preparation of a donor\u2019s will or living trust that names the university as a beneficiary.\n\n\nXIV. Gift Counting and Reporting\n\n\nAdherence to Industry Standards\nTo ensure the highest possible gift crediting and campaign counting integrity, all charitable contributions to the university will be counted and recorded in the University Advancement database of record in accordance with the standards set forth by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE).\nAny exception to CASE standards must be approved by the Vice President for University Advancement.\n\nTypes of Gift Reporting\nFiscal Year Cash and New Fundraising Commitments Reporting\nThese reports display year-to-date cash and\/or new fundraising (commitments) for a specific fiscal year only (July 1 to June 30).\nFiscal year cash reports reflect tangible asset transfers to the university (e.g., outright cash gifts, pledge payments, and realized bequests).\nNew fundraising commitment reports reflect outright cash gifts and new pledges to the university, including planned gifts. These reports highlight the impact of donor commitments to the university, including those that will be realized in the future.\n\nCampaign Reporting\nCampaign reporting differs from fiscal year reporting in that fundraising totals span more than one fiscal year. The principles for counting gifts during a campaign include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nGifts and pledges received or committed to during the specific period of time identified for a campaign are counted in campaign totals.\nA gift or pledge received or committed to prior to the start of the campaign period may be counted only if the gift or pledge was not counted in a previous campaign, and if it meets one of the following criteria:\n\nThe gift or pledge was made by the donor with the explicit understanding that it would be counted in current campaign totals.\nThe pledge payment made was on a prior non\u2010campaign pledge.\nThe gift or pledge was a challenge grant that will be met during the campaign period.\n\n\nThe value of any canceled or unfulfilled pledges must be subtracted from campaign totals if it is in the future determined they will not be realized.\n\nGift Recognition Reporting\nUniversity Advancement also produces reports demonstrating the impact donors have beyond the legal credit assigned based on IRS regulations. These reports may include all of a donor\u2019s cash gifts, as well as pledges and soft credit (e.g., donations though donor advised funds, matching gift companies, and related family foundations). These reports may be used to help determine donor eligibility for various forms of recognition (e.g., giving societies), among other purposes.\n\n\nClarification on Differences between Financial Accounting and Reporting and Advancement Reporting\nIt is important to clarify the distinction between financial accounting, which underlies the financial reporting of gifts following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and Advancement reporting, which is a measure of fundraising activity in accordance with standards set forth by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) and approved by the Vice President for University Advancement. This policy focuses on Advancement reporting, not financial accounting and reporting.\nUniversity Advancement tracks all outright gifts, pledges, and planned gifts received. The intent of advancement reporting is to reflect the total impact of fundraising efforts by representing all gifts, including the value of pledges and planned gifts, at both face and present values.\nGift revenue accounted for in the University\u2019s financial accounting system and presented in the university\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements is in accordance with US GAAP and may differ from gifts included in Advancement reporting for a number of reasons including but not limited to: transfers of assets not recognized as gifts in the University\u2019s financial accounting system; gifts recognized in different periods than in Advancement reporting; and gifts reported at different amounts based on differing methodologies used to value gifts in the University\u2019s financial accounting system and Advancement reporting.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

However, certain specific situations can occur which will result in such costs being more appropriately charged as a direct cost of the project.\nSituation in which Administrative\/Secretarial Salary Costs Can Be Directly Charged\nCosts which are appropriate to be charged directly to a sponsored research grant or contract must meet the definition which is detailed in OMB Circular A-21:\n\"Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project ... or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as either direct or F&A costs. Where an institution treats a particular type of cost as a direct cost of sponsored agreements, all costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances shall be treated as direct costs of all activities of the institution.\"\nIn July 1993, Section F.6.b of the Circular was revised to reflect the following wording regarding the charging of administrative costs within academic departments and research units:\n\"In developing the departmental administration cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or F&A costs. ... Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate where a major project or activity explicitly budgets for administrative or clerical services and individuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity.\"\nThe Appendix[1] presents the official interpretation of Section F.6.b (developed jointly by several Federal agencies).\nTo directly charge administrative and secretarial salary (and benefit) costs to a sponsored program, ALL of the following guidelines must apply:\n\nActivities of administrative staff must relate to the project directly (i.e., the project's technical mission);\nMust be measurable and identifiable (as described in the passage from OMB A-21 above);\nMust go beyond \"routine\" departmental support. (Routine departmental support refers to activities which must be carried out in order to support the conduct of research generally at the university. Such activities would include typing progress reports, technical reports, and final reports; preparing periodic cost reports; answering telephones; scheduling meetings; making travel arrangements; monitoring budgets; business meetings with the principal invstigator; review of accounting reports.)\nAdministrative or secretarial devoted to a specific grant or contract totals 20% or more of an individual's allocated effort.\n\nAnother situation in which administrative and secretarial salary costs would be appropriately charged directly to a sponsored research award is where the project is considered to be major in scope. A research center may be established in such cases. These projects generally entail more complex reporting requirements, involve faculty and researchers from two or more disciplines, and may involve coordination with organizations other than Carnegie Mellon.\nInclusion of Administrative and Secretarial Salary Costs in Program Budget\nIt is important that where administrative or secretarial salary costs are contemplated as direct charges to a sponsored award, such costs must be specifically itemized in the proposed budget which will be transmitted to the funding sponsor. The Office of Sponsored Programs can assist with the development of proposal budgets and can answer questions relative to a specific proposal or award.\nAdministrative Non-salary Costs\nOMB Circular A-21 requires that certain departmental expenses related to the normal administration of sponsored programs generally be treated as F&A costs, and reimbursed as part of the institution's overhead rate. Section F.6.b of OMB Circular A-21 states:\n\"Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, and memberships shall normally be treated as F&A costs.\"\nThe university encourages charging non-salary costs directly to the activity which is being supported by the expense whenever it is possible to do so with a high degree of accuracy. For example, travel expenses incurred in performing a research project should be directly charged to the appropriate award. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to determine if such costs have been incurred for the benefit of the specific sponsored project.\nThere are certain types of departmental expenses which cannot be assigned directly to a specific project with a high degree of certainty. Treatment of those types of costs are detailed below.\nOffice Supplies\nOffice supplies should generally be treated as F&A costs. Exceptions to this guideline are:\n\nSuch supplies are purchased in relation to a major project center; or\nThe specific project requires the purchase of a large number of supplies that can be identified and charged to that project. An example is a project which requires the production of an extensive data survey - the costs of producing the survey document can be charged directly to the research award.\n\nComputer Supplies\nComputer supplies specifically acquired in support of a sponsored research project can be charged to the appropriate research award.\nCopying\nCopying charges can be allocated directly to sponsored projects if a mechanism exists to charge all copying to the appropriate activity. For example, many copiers have the capability of charging all copy jobs via an identification code. In such a situation, it is appropriate to charge such costs to research awards.\nIf records are not maintained regarding copier use, copying costs should be treated as F&A costs.\nPostage\nPostage charges can be allocated directly to sponsored projects if a mechanism exists to charge all postage to the appropriate activity. For example, postage should be charged directly to the research awards if a specific project requires the mailing of a large number of surveys. Overnight mail deliveries (e.g., Airborne, Federal Express, messenger services) can be charged directly to the appropriate awards.\nTelephone\nLong distance telephone calls which are specifically identified on telephone reports can be directly charged to research awards. All other costs related to telephones (line charges, local usage units) should be treated as F&A costs (unless relating to a major project or research center).\nFaxes\nFaxes can be allocated directly to sponsored projects if a mechanism exists to charge all fax usage to the appropriate activity. If records are not maintained regarding fax use, fax charges should be treated as F&A costs.\nMemberships\nMembership dues to academic, technical, or professional societies are unallowable and cannot be charged to research awards.\n\n[1]APPENDIX\nGovernment agency interpretation of OMB Circular A-21 revisions re: charging of administrative costs directly to sponsored research grants and contracts.\nOMB Circular A-21 Treatment of Administrative and Clerical Salaries\nQuestion\nSection F.6.b of the July 1993 revision of Circular A-21 says that the salaries of administrative and clerical staff should normally be treated as F&A costs. This section goes on to say that direct charging of these costs may be appropriate where a major project or activity explicitly budgets for administrative or clerical services and the individuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity. What is the intent of this provision and under what circumstances may these costs be directly charged to sponsored agreements?\nAnswer\nThis provision is intended to establish the principle that the salaries of administrative and clerical staff should usually be treated as F&A costs, but that direct charging of these costs may be appropriate where the nature of the work performed under a particular project requires an extensive amount of administrative or clerical support which is significantly greater than the routine level of such services provided by academic departments. The costs would need to meet the general criteria for direct charging in Section D.1. - i.e., \"be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project ... relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy,\" and the special circumstances requiring direct charging of the services would need to be justified to the satisfaction of the awarding agency in the grant application or contract proposal.\nThe following examples are illustrative of circumstances where direct charging of the salaries of administrative and clerical staff may be appropriate.\n\nLarge, complex programs, such as General Clinical Research Centers, Primate Centers, Program Projects, environmental research centers, engineering research centers, and other grants and contracts that entail assembling and managing teams of investigators from a number of institutions.\nProjects which involve extensive data accumulation, analysis and entry, surveying, tabulation, cataloging, searching literature, and reporting, such as epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and retrospective clinical records studies.\nProjects that require making travel and meeting arrangements for large number of participants, such as conferences and seminars.\nProjects whose principal focus is the preparation and production of manuals and large reports, books and monographs (excluding routine progress and technical reports).\nProjects that are geographically inaccessible to normal departmental administrative services, such as seagoing research vessels, radio astronomy projects, and other research field sites that are remote from the campus.\nIndividual projects requiring project-specific database management; individualized graphics or manuscript preparation; human or animal protocols; and multiple project-related investigator coordination and communications.\n\nThese examples are not exhaustive nor are they intended to imply that direct charging of administrative or clerical salaries would always be appropriate for the situations illustrated in the examples. For instance, the examples would be appropriate when the costs of such activities are incurred in unlike circumstances, i.e., the actual activities charged direct are not the same as the actual activities normally included in the institution's facilities and administrative (F&A) cost pools or, if the same, the indirect activity costs are immaterial in amount. It would be inappropriate to charge the cost of such activities directly to specific sponsored agreements if, in similar circumstances, the costs of performing the same type of activity for other sponsored agreements were included as allocable costs in the institution's F&A cost pools. Application of negotiated predetermined F&A cost rates may also be inappropriate if such activity costs charged directly were not provided for in the allocation base that was used to determine the predetermined F&A cost rates.\n   \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the assistant vice provost for Research Compliance, ext. 8-4727.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED POLICIES:\n\n\nAppointment and Tenure Policy\nStudent Discipline\nStaff Grievance Procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nCarnegie Mellon University is responsible for the integrity of research conducted at the university. As a community of scholars, in which truth and integrity are fundamental, the university must establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct of research with due care to protect the rights of those accused, those making the allegations, and the university. Furthermore, federal regulations require the university to have explicit procedures for addressing incidents in which there are allegations of misconduct in research.\nIntroduction\nThis document outlines the procedures to be followed when misconduct in research is alleged at Carnegie Mellon. As defined by the National Science Foundation:[1]\n\"Misconduct means (1) fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other serious deviation from accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, or reporting results from research; (2) material failure to comply with Federal requirements for the protection of researchers, human subjects, or the public or for ensuring the welfare of laboratory animals; or (3) failure to meet other material legal requirements governing research.\"\nTo be deemed misconduct for the purposes of this policy, a \"material failure to comply with Federal requirements\" or a \"failure to meet other material legal requirements\" must be intentional or grossly negligent.\nIn conjunction with the procedures outlined in this policy, the provost is responsible for complying with applicable federal regulations, including notifying sponsoring agencies at the appropriate time.[2] and keeping those involved, Committees of Inquiry and Committees of Investigation, well informed with respect to the requirements of these agencies. If at any time it appears that the possibility exists that the alleged misconduct might involve a violation of any federal, state or local criminal statute, the university attorney must be consulted immediately to determine further action.\nAllegations\nQuestions about, or suspicions of, misconduct in research should be brought to the attention of the provost for confidential counseling and possible informal resolution.\nAllegations of misconduct shall be presented to the provost in writing. Anonymous reports will not be accepted. The provost will acknowledge allegations in writing to the claimant.[3]\nAfter a review of the allegation, the provost must decide within 15 days whether a Committee of Inquiry is needed and, if so, establish such a committee promptly. The claimant must be informed, in writing, of the provost's decision.\nIf a decision is made to establish a Committee of Inquiry, the respondent[3] must be informed in writing of the allegation, advised of the initiation of the inquiry process, and asked to provide information.\nCommittee of Inquiry\nThe provost shall appoint a three-member Committee of Inquiry. Committee members should be faculty or staff who, in the judgment of the provost, have the appropriate seniority and knowledge to assess the alleged misconduct and do not have a conflict of interest that would interfere with an objective review.\nThe provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Inquiry to conduct a discreet inquiry based on communication with the respondent and the claimant. The purpose of the inquiry is to determine if there is reason to believe that misconduct has occurred. The inquiry should be limited to activities necessary to determine whether to recommend a formal investigation.\nThe identities of the respondent and claimant will be kept confidential by members of the committee, if possible.\nIf a majority of the members of the committee of Inquiry recommend that a formal investigation be conducted, the provost must establish a Committee of Investigation. If only a minority of the members of the Committee of Inquiry recommend a formal investigation, the provost may either dismiss the allegation or establish a Committee of Investigation.\nIf the Committee of Inquiry determines that the allegations have been made in a capricious or malicious manner, they will report this to the provost for appropriate action.\nThe Committee of Inquiry has 30 days to conduct the inquiry. If the inquiry cannot be reasonably completed within 30 days, the Committee may request a 30-day extension from the provost.\nIf a decision is made to establish a Committee of Investigation, the respondent must be informed of the identity of the claimant, shown all of the documents and evidence that relate to the charges, and given 15 days to respond prior to initiating the investigation. Sponsoring agencies shall be informed if appropriate or mandated.\nCommittee of Investigation\nThe Committee of Investigation shall have five members, none of whom was a member of the Committee of Inquiry. The provost will appoint two members. The chairmen of the University Research Council, the Faculty Review Committee, and the faculty will each appoint one member.\nThe provost shall charge, in writing, the Committee of Investigation to conduct a thorough investigation of the allegation. The committee should have access to all persons and information needed to determine the extent to which misconduct has occurred. Otherwise, the investigation should be as confidential as possible.\nThe Committee of Investigation shall prepare a written report documenting the extent to which misconduct has occurred. This report will be given to the provost, the respondent, the claimant, the chairman of the University Research Council, the chairman of the Faculty Review Committee, the chairman of the faculty, the university ombudsman, and the president and, if any involved individual is a student, to the dean of Student Affairs.\nOptionally, the Committee of Investigation may recommend to the provost a course of action based on their findings.\nThe Committee of Investigation has 120 days to complete the investigation. If the investigation cannot be reasonably completed within 120 days, the committee may request a 30-day extension from the provost.\nDetermination of Action and Appeal\nThe provost will transmit to the president of the university the reports of the Committee of Inquiry and the Committee of Investigation together with his recommendation for appropriate action.\nWhen the provost's recommendation to the president calls for no action to be taken against an individual respondent and the president concurs, as well as when the president declines to accept a recommendation for action, the president shall, at that respondent's request, in writing, address to that respondent a letter identifying the allegations investigated and stating the reasons for the provost's recommendation and\/or the president's decision, as appropriate. This letter shall be available for responsible use at the addressee's discretion. It shall not be included in the personnel file unless such inclusion is requested, in writing, by the addressee. The president's letter must be formulated, and used by the recipient, so as to preserve the confidentiality of the process, and shall in particular include only information already disclosed to the addressee.\nFor each individual respondent found responsible for misconduct, the president may impose (or request, in the case of a regular, research, or special faculty member) specific sanctions, including termination of employment for a faculty or staff member and expulsion of a student.\nThe imposition of sanctions is subject to the procedures for approval and\/or appeal prescribed by the Appointment and Tenure Policy for a regular, research, or special faculty member; the Staff Grievance Procedure for a staff member (or the provisions of a written labor agreement for an employee in a bargaining unit); and the provisions of the section on Discipline in the Student Handbook for a student.\nFollowing completion of the Committee of Investigation's work and the provost's recommendation, when an individual respondent is a faculty member, if the president decides to initiate against that faculty member the procedure for dismissal for cause or for the imposition of another sanction, the procedure is then subject to the Exceptions provision of the subsection Procedures of the section entitled Dismissal for Cause and Other Sanctions of the Appointment and Tenure Policy, thus precluding the Ad-Hoc Committee stage.\nThe provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this section are also applicable to appropriate action regarding each individual claimant found responsible for allegations made in a capricious or malicious manner.\nFootnotes:\n[1] National Science Foundation. 45 CFR Part 689. \"Misconduct in Science and Engineering Research,\" Federal Register. Vol. 52. No. 126. Wednesday, July 1, 1987, p. 24468.\n[2] Currently, NSF requires notification when it is decided that a formal investigation will be undertaken; however, it should be borne in mind that guidelines in many agencies are currently under development, so it would be impossible to incorporate such guidelines in this policy.\n[3] \"Claimant\" and \"respondent\" are the terms used by the Association of American Universities in their draft document, Framework for Institutional Policies and Procedures for Fraud in Research, August, 1988. We have chosen to use these terms in this document. The terms \"claimant\" and \"respondent\" in this policy stand for singular or plural, as the case may require, unless qualified as \"individual claimant\" or \"individual respondent,\" respectively.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It was most recently modified on April 3, 2018.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\n\nOffice of the Provost. Questions about this Policy content should be directed to the University Registrar's Office, 412-268-7404.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED DOCUMENTS:\nTransfer Credit Evaluation and Assignment Policy Procedure for the Appeal of Grades and Academic Actions (from Student Handbook\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses, whether those students are undergraduates, non-degree students or graduate students. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning and Changing Grades (including Final and Mid-Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options (Audit and Pass\/Fail), Drop\/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate and graduate Grading Standards.\nThis policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses, whether those students are undergraduates, non-degree students or graduate students. This policy covers the specifics of Assigning and Changing Grades (including Final and Mid-Semester grades, Incompletes and Conditional Failures), Grading Options (Audit and Pass\/Fail), Drop\/Withdrawals, Course Repeats, and defines the undergraduate and graduate Grading Standards.\nQuestions about grading for a specific course should be addressed to the instructor of the course in question. Graduate students with questions about Pass\/Fail and Drop\/Withdrawal should contact their individual programs.\nAppeals for an exception to any grading policy may be made by the dean's office of the student\u00eds home college.\n1. Definitions\nCertain terms are used in this document with specific meanings, as defined in this section.\n\nStudent means any full-time or part-time degree-seeking undergraduate or graduate student, or full-time or part-time non-degree student.\nNon-degree student means a student that is not in a university degree program.\nFaculty means members of the university's Faculty Organization as defined in the Faculty Handbook, plus instructors and special faculty appointments (even in the first year), and part-time faculty.\nInstructor means a faculty member, teaching assistant, and \/or lecturer who is the instructor of record, as recorded in the Student Information System (SIS).\n\n2. Policy Provisions\nAssigning Grades\nFinal grades are awarded to each student, in each course scheduled, at the end of the semester, mini-semester or summer session. All students taking a course at Carnegie Mellon must be assigned grades.\nEnrollment Services will query instructors who do not assign a grade to a student. Copies of the query regarding the lack of grade will be sent to the student, to the dean and to the department head. If the instructor does not assign a letter grade or an incomplete grade within one month of Enrollment Service\u00eds query, the department head will be responsible for insuring that a grade is assigned.\nChanging a Grade\nA student who believes that an assigned grade is incorrect, may request that a final grade be changed. Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and, for undergraduates, with the approval of the dean\u00eds office of the college\/school offering the course; for graduate students, department approval is required. The intention of this policy is to insure that, under normal circumstances, all students in a class are treated equally and no student is unduly advantaged.\nMid-Semester Grades\nMid-semester grades provide valuable feedback to students as they assess their performance in courses. Furthermore, mid-semester grades and the QPA's they generate are used by Deans and advisors in identifying and dealing in a timely way with students in academic trouble. Therefore it is imperative that mid-semester grades accurately reflect student performance and are turned in on time.\nMid-semester grades are not permanent and are kept only until final grades are recorded. Because mid-semester grades are not permanent, changes of mid-semester grades as a rule will not be accepted.\nIncomplete Grades\nCarnegie Mellon students are expected to complete a course during the academic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a grade of I (incomplete) may be given when a student, for reasons beyond his or her control, has been unable to complete the work of a course, but the work completed to date is of passing quality and the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.\nIn awarding an I grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for completing the work and designate a default letter grade where no further work is submitted. Students must complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic semester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the permanent grade by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or Enrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade.\nConditional Failures\nX grades are conditional failures. They are factored in the student grade point average as a failure in the semester they are awarded and can be replaced by nothing higher than a D. When awarding an X grade, the instructor specifies to the student the requirements necessary to achieve a grade of D. Requirements may be the completion of a proscribed course with a performance of C or better or may be specified work related to the course in which the student received the X. Students must complete the required course work no later than the end of the following academic semester, or sooner if required by prior agreement. The instructor must record the permanent grade of D by the last day of the examination period of that following semester, or Enrollment Services will administratively assign the default grade of R.\nPass\/Fail Grades\nUndergraduate students may elect to take a free-elective course pass\/fail unless precluded by the course, the course's department or the student's home department\/college. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges\/departments\/programs for details. A student must submit a Grade Option Request Form to Enrollment Services indicating the course they are electing as pass\/fail before the end of the university's withdraw period. This decision is irreversible thereafter. No information regarding the student's decision will be passed on to the instructor. Instructors will submit letter grades, which will automatically be converted to pass\/fail.\nA through D work will receive credit for units passed and be recorded as P on the student's academic record; below D work will receive no credit and will be recorded as N on the student's academic record. No quality points will be assigned to P or N units; P or N units will not be factored into the student's QPA.\nIn exceptional circumstances, departments may ask to designate a course pass\/fail or request that the course be evaluated only with letter grades. The College Council must approve designating a course as pass\/fail only or as graded only. If such a decision will have an adverse effect on the requirements of any other college, Academic Council must review the decision. The decision to designate a course as graded or pass\/fail must be made before the add period for the course and is irreversible thereafter.\nAudit Grades\nAuditing is presence in the classroom without receiving academic credit, a pass\/fail or a letter grade. The extent of a student\u00eds participation must be arranged and approved by the course instructor. A student wishing to audit a course is required to register for the course, complete the Course Audit Approval Form, obtain permission of the course instructor and their advisor, and return the form to The HUB prior to the last day to add a course.\nAny student enrolled full-time (36 units) may audit a course without additional charges. Part-time or non-degree students who choose to audit a course will be assessed tuition at the regular per-unit tuition rate.\nDrop\/Withdrawal Grades\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon may drop a course by accessing on-line registration on or before the drop deadline as published in the official university calendar. This applies to all courses with the exception of mini-semester courses. Policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges\/departments\/programs for details. The deadline to drop a mini-semester course is the last day of the second week of the mini-semester course. When a course is dropped by these deadlines, the course is removed and does not appear on the academic record.\nAfter the deadline to drop, students may withdraw from a course by accessing on-line registration by the end of the 10th week of class as noted in the academic calendar. After the deadline to drop, a W (withdrawal) grade is assigned and appears on the student's academic record. W grades do not apply to graduate students except in Tepper and MCS. Students may use a late drop voucher for a limited number of course drops after the deadline during the pursuit of their degree. This action must be taken through consultation with their academic advisor or associate dean. Details on the late drop voucher process can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog and the Graduate Education website.\u00a0\nUndergraduates who are registered as full-time students as of the 10th day of classes are expected to remain full-time for the duration of the semester. Full-time is defined as registered for a minimum of 36 units. Permission to drop below the 36-unit minimum can only be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the student's home Associate Dean. Undergraduates who are registered as part-time are also subject to the above deadlines to drop or withdraw from a course.\nCourse Repeats\nWhen a course is repeated, all grades will be recorded on the official academic transcript and will be calculated in the student\u00eds QPA. This is the case regardless if the first grade for the course is a passing or failing grade.\nUndergraduate students who wish to repeat a course already passed must obtain approval from the student's Dean or Department Head. When a student takes a course s\/he has already passed, only one set of units will count towards graduation requirements.\n3.

Special students taking graduate courses will be graded on the graduate grading scale (see below).\nAny +\/- grades received by undergraduate students when taking graduate-level courses will automatically convert to the corresponding letter grade as listed in the scale above.\nThe Graduate student Grading Standard is as follows (as of Fall 1995):\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\nQuality Points\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nA+\n\n\n4.33\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n4.0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nA-\n\n\n3.67\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nB+\n\n\n3.33\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n3.0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nB-\n\n\n2.67\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nC+\n\n\n2.33\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n2.0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nC-\n\n\n1.67\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nD+\n\n\n1.33\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n1.0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n0.0\n\n\nFailure\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n0.0\n\n\nConditional failure\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nSatisfactory\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nPassing\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nNot Passing\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nAudit\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nWithdrawal\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nIncomplete\n\n\n\n\nAD\n\n\nNon-factorable\n\n\nCredit granted for work completed at another institution or by examination credit\n\n\n\n\n \nThis grading standard is for all students classified as seeking a graduate degree and special students taking graduate courses.\nStudents who entered Carnegie Mellon (as graduate students) prior to Fall 1995 follow their previous graduate grading standard. Graduate students who take a leave of absence and return to Carnegie Mellon will do so under the 4.33-point grading scale. These students will have their past semester QPAs recalculated at the time of their return.\nNo A+ may be given in an H&SS or CIT course. No D or D+ may be given in a Tepper course. Pass\/Fail policies for graduate students vary and students should be advised to check with their individual colleges\/departments\/programs for details. Only Tepper and MCS record W grades.\nDepartment and college policy determine minimum passing grades in graduate courses. Any course that a graduate student completes will be graded using this scale. This includes undergraduate courses taken by graduate students, and special students taking graduate courses.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

It appears in the current Faculty Handbook.\n\n\nACCOUNTABLE DEPARTMENT\/UNIT:\nOffice of the Provost. Questions on policy content should be directed to the Office of the Provost, ext. 8-6684.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nNo one may enter a faculty member's office, or search a faculty member's files, or examine or remove work products or documentary material (e.g., research data, notes on interviews, drafts of publications or lectures, notes used in the preparation of publications or lectures, audio and visual tapes, films, outtakes, mental impressions, opinion and other material intended for dissemination of information to students, colleagues or the general public) without permission, even if the faculty member is absent.\nExceptions may be made when the occupant's employment with the university has been terminated or when repeated and thorough attempts have been made to contact the occupant (or, if the occupant is deceased, her or his personal representative or, if she or he has none, then the person named to receive her or his life insurance proceeds under the university's life insurance plan), and if neither applies, entry can be made as stated hereafter. No such entry shall be made except by two persons together, one an officer of the university and the other the chair of the Faculty Review Committee. Before making entry these persons shall particularly describe in writing the property or things sought or to be seized.\nExceptions to the procedure for entry also may be made for routine building maintenance, space planning, building emergencies or for the retrieval of joint work or routine documents where the faculty member is not readily available to grant permission and there exists a strong presumption of her or his likely approval of the purpose of the entry.\nExceptions to the procedure may also be made when there is probable cause to believe the occupant is engaged in a crime, in which case a search warrant would be obtained.\nUnder any conditions of entry the occupant of the office shall immediately afterwards be furnished a list of, and\/or copies of, the property or things copied or taken, if any.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Questions on policy content should be directed to the University Archivist, ext. 8-7402.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nCarnegie Mellon University, recognizing its responsibility to the academic community and to the public to ensure the preservation of records documenting the activities and development of the university, its faculty, and its students, adheres to the following policy for the collection, preservation, and maintenance of records, papers, and publications that foster historical research and assist with the operation of the university.\nOfficial university records and publications are university property and include: annual reports, academic and administrative committee minutes, memoranda, correspondence, planning documents, transcripts, subject files, conference proceedings, budget and financial statements, and government contracts produced or received in the transaction of its business.\nAdministration officers, faculty, university personnel, and committees of the Board of Trustees who generate records while working in an official capacity for the university should observe the following regulations:\n\nHistorical records in Carnegie Mellon University offices should be preserved, pending consultation between the office of origin and the University Archivist.\nThe University Archives is the final repository for all official records, papers, and university publications. Materials deemed to have historical or administrative significance should be transferred to the University Archives.\nThe officer in charge of the relevant administrative and academic unit, after consultation with the University Archivist, may determine the need for restrictions of access.\n\nIn conjunction with this last point, Carnegie Mellon University archival records, with the exception of published materials, will remain restricted for a period of twenty years from the date of their creation unless otherwise specified by the office of origin.\nAccess to restricted records is limited to the University Archivist and the office of origin. Special consideration for access of restricted records will be given to others when written approval from the appropriate officer in the office of origin is presented to the University Archivist.\nThe University Archives would also welcome the personal papers of faculty, administration, staff or alumni relating to the history of the university or areas of special interest to the university.\u00a0\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Recruiting a highly qualified, talented and diverse executive team is a crucial part of that success. The university\u2019s Executive Compensation Policy is overseen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees (an independent body), and establishes the principles and practices under which Carnegie Mellon rewards executive talent. This Policy provides procedures for the review and approval of executive compensation as further defined below and consistent with applicable federal tax law and Pennsylvania law.Executives\nThe Executive Compensation Policy covers the following key employee positions:\n\nPresident\nUniversity officers including Secretary, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer\nProvost\nVice Presidents\nDeans of Academic Units\nDirector CEO of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI)\n\nElements of Total Compensation\n\nBase Salary: Salary is the primary component of executive total compensation. It provides a competitive foundation for pay and reflects the individual\u2019s role, stature in his\/her field, unique skills and abilities, experience and performance against established metrics.The university\u2019s salary pool applicable to base salary is determined annually. Salary increases are not an entitlement but rather determined based on an individual\u2019s performance against defined metrics, salary pool, available budget, market conditions and internal equity considerations.\nAnnual Incentives: With the exception of the Chief Investment Officer and certain members of the Investment Office staff, Carnegie Mellon does not have a broad annual incentive program for executives. However, based on market circumstances and individual situations, compensation for certain positions may include incentive compensation from time to time.\nHealth and Welfare Benefits: Executives are provided with health and welfare benefits that are competitive with CMU\u2019s peer\/comparison universities, most of which are offered to all employees of the university.\nRetirement Benefits: Executives are provided with competitive retirement benefits offered to all employees of the university.\nIn addition to the above, some executives may receive select additional benefits and perquisites.Total compensation, including base salary, incentives, health and welfare benefits, deferred compensation, retirement benefits and other additional benefits and perquisites will be reviewed and determined annually for the President and each position within the purview of the Committee.Comparability DataFor executive positions, Carnegie Mellon competes and recruits for talent nationally, and for some positions, internationally, among both public and private institutions.\u00a0 For some administrative roles the university may consider talent from outside higher education if the candidate is a particularly good fit with the institution and position.\u00a0 Carnegie Mellon primarily considers comparative data for similarly qualified persons in functionally comparable positions at similarly situated institutions.Criteria used to determine this comparison market includes:\n\nClassification as a research university\nMembership in the Association of American Universities (AAU)\nNational rankings overall and by discipline\nHighly selective, primarily private institutions\nHighly selective public institutions in certain disciplines\nInstitutions with which the university competes for students and faculty talent\n\nCarnegie Mellon participates in an annual survey of Executive Compensation among Select Universities conducted by the independent firm of Towers Watson.\u00a0 The approximately 30 universities included in this survey reflect the above criteria, and the survey data are used as the primary comparison market.Certain positions where the talent is unique to a different set of institutions will require a different comparison market.\u00a0 In those instances, the above survey data is supplemented with data from the College and University Professional Association (CUPA). The Compensation Committee is responsible for periodically evaluating the comparison market(s), which may change from time to time.Compensation PhilosophyIn the aggregate, Carnegie Mellon seeks to set competitive rates in the comparison market.\u00a0 Salary ranges for each position will be determined using the relevant survey\u2019s 25th to 75th percentiles as lower and upper bounds for the ranges. Salary ranges will be adjusted annually based on new survey data and validated by the Compensation Committee. Matters such as performance, stature in one\u2019s field, resource planning and management, donor cultivation and fundraising, internal and external engagement, communication, rare and unique qualifications for the position, leadership experience and other factors will be considered for each position when setting total compensation and may lead to pay above or below the target.\u00a0 Total compensation will be reviewed and established annually during spring compensation review for all positions and for deans, also upon established reappointment reviews or as dictated by other significant events.Performance Measurement and Approval AuthorityIn consultation with the chair of the Board, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees is responsible for determining the President\u2019s annual performance expectations, evaluating the performance of and recommending to the Executive Committee of the Board for approval total compensation for the President.\u00a0 The chair of the board is responsible for communication of performance and compensation decisions and rationale to the President.The President is responsible for performance evaluation and Total Compensation recommendations for officers, vice presidents and the Provost.\u00a0 The Provost is responsible for performance evaluation and total compensation recommendations for deans and the Director\/CEO of the SEI.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee is responsible for approving all executive total compensation as defined except for that of the President, which, as noted above, must be further approved by the Executive Committee.\u00a0 For all other positions, the President and the Provost are responsible for communication of performance and compensation decisions and rationale for their respective reports.In addition to base compensation, the chief investment officer is eligible for bonus compensation as further defined in his\/her employment agreement.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee, the President and the Investment Committee, and in particular, its chair, are responsible for establishing and evaluating performance against the CIO\u2019s bonus compensation criteria and approving same.\u00a0 Any other executive bonus compensation will be as defined in the relevant employment agreement and subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee on the recommendation of the President.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

In order for a controlled subsidiary, affiliate, or joint venture or such unincorporated activity within the university to begin operations, the following procedures must be followed:\n\nThe Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and the Vice President and General Counsel will examine the proposal for creation of such entity or unincorporated activity.\nThose executive offices will report to the President and to the Provost as to whether compelling business and\/or legal reasons support establishing a separate entity. In the case of a proposed unincorporated activity, those executive offices will report to the President and the Provost regarding the proposed reasons for establishing the unincorporated activity. Their reports shall include, among other things, a report on the manner in which the new entity or unincorporated activity shall operate, the manner in which the university's name (or any part thereof) is proposed to be associated therewith,\u00a0 and assurance that the new entity (whether it is intended to be a for-profit or not-for-profit entity) or unincorporated activity will operate in a manner that complies with the university\u2019s obligations as a tax exempt entity, and the controls which will be in place.\nAfter the steps in Sections 1 and 2 are completed, the approval of the Board of Trustees must be obtained before the university-controlled subsidiary, affiliated entity or joint venture or unincorporated activity may begin operations.\u00a0\nOnce the approval of the Board of Trustees is obtained, the controlled subsidiary, affiliated entity, or joint venture or unincorporated activity may begin operations, strictly in accordance with the approval provided by the Board of Trustees, including any specific requirements placed thereon by the Board (including, without limitation, with respect to the association with or use of the university\u2019s name).\u00a0 In all circumstances, the controlled subsidiary, affiliated entity, or joint venture or the unincorporated activity shall operate in a manner consistent with the university\u2019s requirements under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vice President and General Counsel shall be responsible for reviewing and reporting to the Board of Trustees periodically regarding the operation of such entities or unincorporated activities in accordance with this Policy. Further, the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Vice President and General Counsel shall jointly review and report to the Board regarding the operation of university-controlled subsidiaries, affiliated entities, joint ventures or unincorporated activities which existed as of the date of the adoption of this Policy.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Policy Office\n\n\nArticles of Incorporation\n\n\nBylaws of the University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213                 (412) 268-1275\n\n\nLegal Info\nwww.cmu.edu\n\n\u00a9 2016 Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n\n\nCMU RSS Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Administrative and Governance\n    \n\n                      Alcohol and Drug Policy\n    \n\n                      Alumni Relations \n    \n\n                      Artistic Properties Collection\n    \n\n                      Code of Business Ethics and Conduct\n    \n\n                      Code of Workplace Conduct for Trademark Licensees\n    \n\n                      Conflict of Interest -

Address specific questions about your status to your home department\/school. Questions on general Policy content should be directed to the University Registrar's Office, 412-268-8250.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\nPrevious policy,\u00a0Doctoral Candidate Policies for All But Dissertation (ABD) [PDF]\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Statement\nThe university has a policy that covers: time limits on doctoral student status,\u00a0 a definition of All But Dissertation status, a definition of In Residence and In Absentia status for doctoral students and the tuition and fees charged for students In Residence and students In Absentia.  These rules apply to all doctoral students. Students who began their doctoral studies prior to the date of this policy\u2019s revision may follow time-to-degree requirements from the previous policy, but all other rules set forth in this policy will apply immediately to all doctoral students.\nTime to Degree\nStudents will complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree within a maximum of ten years from original matriculation as a doctoral student, or less if required by a more restrictive department or college policy.\u00a0 Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program.  Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean, defer the lapse of All But Dissertation status for a period commensurate with the duration of that interruption. Students, who are pursuing the Ph.D. degree as part-time students for all semesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree limit.\nAll But Disssertation Status\nAll But Dissertation, ABD, status is intended for students whose only remaining requirements are the completion and defense of their thesis. Once a student meets the departmental criteria[1], All But Dissertation status must be approved by the department in writing to university-registrars-office@andrew.cmu.edu.\nIn Residence Versus In Absentia\nOnce students achieve All But Dissertation status, they must choose whether to complete their dissertation In Residence or In Absentia. A doctoral student In Residence maintains student status and all consequent student privileges and continues to be actively engaged with the university. A doctoral student In Absentia status, ABS, is one who has left the university with the intent of completing their dissertation but not actively engaged with the university and does not require university resources as outlined below. When a student decides whether to pursue All But Dissertation In Residence or In Absentia, he\/she must complete a Doctoral Student Status Agreement form, which is available through their academic department or on the HUB web site. Once the agreement has been approved by the student\u2019s department, the student may change his\/her status from In Residence to In Absentia multiple times. A student In Residence or In Absentia must meet the specific criteria noted later in this policy.  No student In Absentia will be verified by the university as a \"student\" for immigration or loan purposes. All But Dissertation students in J1 or F1 immigration status must continue to follow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations[2].\nAll But Dissertation Students In Residence\nAll But Dissertation students In Residence receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program that is\u00a0 paid by or administered by the university must be enrolled for at least thirty-six units to maintain full time student status and all subsequent student privileges. Exceptions to the thirty-six unit enrollment requirement may be granted by the Provost.[3]  All But Dissertation students In Residence who are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), from the university tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program should consult their college policy to determine the number of units for which they must be registered in order to maintain full-time student status and all subsequent privileges.  All But Dissertation students In Residence who are pursuing their doctoral degree on a part time basis and are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), from the university tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program should consult their college policy to determine the number of units they must be registered for in order to maintain part time student status and all subsequent privileges.\u00a0 Note that doctoral students must be a full time graduate student for at least one academic year or more if required by the student\u2019s home college.  All But Dissertation students who are employed by the University in a capacity independent of their educational program and are pursuing a doctoral degree part time, may register for the number of units required by their department in order to remain in part time status so long as they are not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program by their college, school or department.\u00a0 Questions about eligibility for tuition benefits should be referred to the Benefits Department.\nFinal Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence\nStudents who are supported by the university must be registered for thirty-six units for the entirety of their final semester and will be assessed their college\u2019s full-time tuition. If a student completes all Ph.D. degree requirements and is certified by:\n\nSeptember 30th (in the fall), or February 28th (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted to $0; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the semester.\nOctober 31st (in the fall), or March 31st (in the spring), tuition will be adjusted to 50% of the full-time tuition; however, they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the semester.\nAfter October 31st (in the fall), or after March 31st (in the spring), but BEFORE the first day of the next semester, tuition will not be adjusted and they will remain enrolled for thirty-six units for the semester.\nFees will not be adjusted.\n\n Students registered for less than thirty-six units are not eligible for a tuition adjustment, regardless of certification date.\nAll But Dissertation Students In Absentia\nAn All But Dissertation doctoral student may, upon departmental certification, be regarded as In Absentia when, and so long as, the following three conditions apply:\n\nThe student has been enrolled as a full-time graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University for at least one academic year or more if required by the student's home college. Part-time graduate enrollment may, at the department's discretion, be counted pro-rata toward this requirement.\nThe student does not receive any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance) tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program that is paid by or administered by the university.\nThe student does not require substantial use of university resources. Departmental certification of this condition shall be subject to guidelines established by the school or college.\n\nAccording to university guidelines, students In Absentia may[4]:  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use University Libraries. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use the university stores. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use computing facilities only for department communications and for thesis text preparation. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Enter university buildings for faculty\/student consultations. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be eligible for student health insurance as determined on a case by case basis [5]. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use the Career and Professional Development Center. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Become university employees.\nMay not:  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be employed with a graduate student stipend.[6] \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maintain legal F1 or J1 student status. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use University Health Services.[5] \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy parking permits. [7] \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use athletic facilities.[7] \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reside in university housing.\nEmployment of All But Dissertation Students In Absentia\nAs noted above, All But Dissertation students In Absentia are extended only minimum access to university resources. The student does not receive any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), tied to activities that are integral to their doctoral program paid by or administered by the university.\u00a0 An All But Dissertation student In Absentia cannot be hired for work by Carnegie Mellon University directly related to completing his\/her dissertation and\/or make substantial use of resources for work toward the doctorate as noted above.[4] In order to be in compliance with these policies, the university's employment policies and the Internal Revenue Service, an All But Dissertation student In Absentia may only be hired for university employment through the appropriate employment process. Questions should be referred to Human Resources.\nTuition and Fee Effects of In Absentia Student Status Including the Final Semester\nWhile an All But Dissertation student is In Absentia, no tuition will be assessed. The student will, however, be responsible for all applicable fees. An All But Dissertation student who is In Absentia, who returns to defend their dissertation must change from In Absentia to In Residence and shall be required to register and pay for at minimum five units of graduate study, based on their current school\/college\u2019s tuition before the degree is certified.\nA student who receives support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial) paid for or administered by the university, must follow the policy for Final Semester Tuition for All But Dissertation Students In Residence (see above) and is eligible for the tuition to be pro-rated as identified in the schedule.\nA student who is not receiving any financial support (such as tuition, stipend, fees or health insurance, whether full or partial), paid for or administered by the university will be assessed for the 5 units and the tuition rate will not be adjusted based on certification date.\nNOTE:\u00a0 Doctoral students enrolled prior to fall 2011 are covered by the time to degree requirements as stated in the Doctoral Candidate Policies for All But Dissertation (ABD) Policy which was in place from February 28, 1991 through May 31, 2011. The relevant policy section is: \"Once students achieve ABD status, their doctoral degree candidacy shall continue for a maximum of seven full academic years, unless terminated earlier by conferral of the degree, by academic or administrative action, or by a lapse of candidacy due to more restrictive department or college policy. At the expiration of the seven-year period, candidacy status shall lapse. Once candidacy has lapsed, the person may resume work towards a doctoral degree only if newly admitted to a currently offered doctoral degree program under criteria determined by that program.\"\nFootnotes:\n[1] General examples of having met All But Dissertation requirements may include completing all courses and passing qualifying exams; completing all courses and acceptance of thesis proposal; etc. as defined by program, department or school.  [2] The intent of the DHS regulations is that the student continues to pursue completion of the degree on a full-time basis under the jurisdiction of the university that will award the degree. International students who enter All But Dissertation status must remain In Residence and be registered full-time as defined in this policy to preserve F1 or J1 immigration status while they complete their degree. Questions about All But Dissertation status and immigration requirements should be addressed to the Office of International Education.  [3] If granted exception results in the student\u2019s enrollment being reduced to less than half time, tax consequences may apply.  [4] An All But Dissertation student In Absentia may be hired as an university employee without switching to active student status so long as the hiring department certifies that the student is not hired at Carnegie Mellon for work directly related to his\/her dissertation and that the student does not inappropriately make substantial use of resources for work towards the doctorate as noted above.\u00a0 As an employee, an individual would be eligible for benefits that apply to his\/her status as an employee, not as a graduate student.  [5] University Health Services is not available to students in In Absentia status, except in an emergency, or on a case by case basis. All inquiries may be directed to the Manager of Business Operations, University Health Services.  [6] Graduate students are not considered employees of the university as their primary affiliation with the university is as a student.
