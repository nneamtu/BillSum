A regular employee during active periods of employment and certain inactive periods of employment. See HR16, HR19, HR34, HR88, and HRG11 for eligibility of regular employees during inactive periods of employment.\nb. A faculty or exempt staff member appointed on a full-time Fixed-Term II, or full-time, faculty Visiting Appointment for at least one semester or summer session, during any time covered by that appointment which encompasses both the beginning and end of a semester or summer session.\nc. A member of the armed services who is on the staff of the Department of\nMilitary Science\nAir Force Aerospace Studies\nNaval Science\nd. A retired employee, provided the retiree meets the requirements for the continuation of benefits after retirement.\nSERVICE REQUIREMENT:\nEducational privileges are available for any semester or summer session in which classes begin on or after the faculty or staff member's date of full-time, regular employment.\nEmployees are not eligible for educational privileges for any semester or summer session in which classes begin after the employee's final day of full time, regular employment status. Also, the faculty or staff member must remain in regular employment status for at least one-half of the semester or summer session in order to maintain eligibility for the educational privileges. These limits do not apply to an eligible retiree as indicated in \"d\" in the section above.\nWHERE COURSES ARE OFFERED:\nEligibility for University educational privileges for an employee applies at all University locations.\nLIMITATIONS:\nThe educational privileges apply to all resident instruction and continuing education credit courses except the professional curriculum such as those offered at the College of Medicine at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, the Smeal College of Business Administration Executive MBA Program, and the Dickinson School of Law. Educational privileges do not apply at summer camps or workshops operated by the University unless University credit is given and regular tuition is charged.\nREQUIRED APPROVAL:\nPermission for a regular employee to schedule courses is a special arrangement and privilege, and should not be considered as a right. It is granted only when the supervisor believes that the scheduling of courses will not interfere with the efficient operation of the employee's regular University duties.\nCREDIT LIMITS - 12-MONTH EMPLOYEES:\nScheduling of classes by a regular employee on a twelve-month-service basis (including an academic employee), either for credit or to audit, is limited to sixteen (16) credits per academic year beginning with the summer session.\nAn employee (other than academic) can schedule up to a full schedule of credits during a semester or summer session that the employee is not working, provided that he or she is on vacation or layoff during the entire period of that academic session.\nCREDIT LIMITS - TWO-SEMESTER EMPLOYEE\nScheduling of classes by a regular employee on a two-semester-service basis (including an academic employee), either for credit or to audit, is limited to twelve (12) credits during the two semesters in which the employee has worked within the academic year.\nA two-semester-service basis employee can schedule up to a full schedule of credits during the summer session the employee is not working, provided he or she continues to receive payments on the salary payroll.\nGRADUATE DEGREE LIMITATION:\nNo academic employee above the rank of Instructor, Research Assistant, or equivalent may receive from the University the Master's Degree or the Doctor's Degree in any graduate program where the faculty member has membership, teaches courses, serves on Master's or Doctoral Committees, or has other supervisory responsibilities which might give rise to conflicts of interest. The faculty member should inform his\/her department head of his\/her intention to pursue an advanced degree.\nCOUNTY AGENTS, HOME ECONOMICS EXTENSION PERSONNEL, CERTAIN CONTINUING EDUCATION PERSONNEL:\nA County Agricultural Agent or Home Economics Extension Representative (including those at the Assistant and Associate ranks), and certain Continuing Education personnel with the job titles of Assistant Director for Continuing Education, Area Director, or Area Representative, including Coordinators and Specialists in various subject matters or program areas, can schedule up to a full schedule of credits during a semester or summer session that the employee is not working, provided that he or she is on vacation, layoff, or leave of absence during the entire period of that academic session.\nAMOUNT OF FEE REDUCTION:\nThe educational privileges include a reduction of 75% of the tuition payable per credit.\nOTHER LIMITATIONS:\nThe educational privilege is a generous benefit provided to employees and additional Penn State funds should not be used to supplement the educational privilege benefit. Therefore, those receiving educational privileges are not eligible for University scholarships and also may not receive funding from other University sources(general, restricted or unrestricted miscellaneous funds), with the exception of endowed funds specifically established for the benefit of employees.\nNote that HR38 - University Courses for Training Faculty and Staff covers situations where the department wants an employee to take a course as professional development. General funds may be used in these situations, but the department must pay 100% of the cost and the educational privilege(employee grant-in-aid) does not apply. Departments are not permitted to ask employees to enroll using the educational privilege, and then to reimburse the employee for the 25% of tuition not covered.\nIf additional support is provided through an endowed fund specifically established for the benefit of employees, the award to the employee must be posted in the ISIS system for all credit courses - no direct reimbursement to the employee is permitted. In addition, the application of these funds may only be used to cover remaining tuition - no refunds to employees may result from the application of these funds. All awards to employees must meet the eligibility requirement of the endowment and those receiving the funding must be approved by the budget executive for the unit as well as for the budget executive for the employee's home budget, if not the same as the budget executive for the endowment.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR16 - Leave of Absence without Salary (Other than for Extended Active Military Service)\nHR18 - Graduate Study Leave of Absence\nHR19 - Leave of Absence for Active Military Service or Training\nHR34 - Employment Conditions for Staff Employees\nHR37 - Grant-in-Aid for Dependents of Faculty, Staff and Retires\nHR54 - Continuation of Group Insurance After Age 60, Age 65, and After Retirement or Death\nHR88 - Alternatives to Regular Twelve Month Staff Employment\nHRG11 - Family and Medical Leave\nHRG13 - Definition of Formal Study as Outlined in HR16\nREVISIONS:\nJuly 17, 2008\nOTHER LIMITATIONS section added.\nAugust 1, 2007\nClarification added to Limitations paragraph.\nJuly 1, 2002\nLimitations section - revised to include the Smeal College of Business Administration Executive MBA Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide faculty, staff, and retirees the opportunity to advance their education by taking University courses at reduced fees."},{"university":"psu","name":"ra07","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Collaboration | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesSmall Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Collaboration \n\n\n\nResearch Administration Policies\n\nRA07\nSmall Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Collaboration\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Research and Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nBackground\nDefinitions\nScope\nPolicy\nDisclosure and Reporting Requirement\nGeneral Principles\n\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe U.S. Government funds various scientific research and development projects through its Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. The purpose of the program is to promote research by U.S. companies engaged in innovation and commercialization of technology.\nOnly small for-profit businesses are eligible to apply for these Federal awards. \u00a0Small businesses receiving STTR awards must collaborate with a non-profit research institution, like a university. Although STTR awards, like Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards (Policy RA06 \u201cSBIR Collaboration Policy\u201d), facilitate innovative research and technology development, the STTR program has different criteria to accomplish those goals.\u00a0The Principal Investigator for an STTR award, unlike for an SBIR, need not be a full-time employee (at least 51%) of the small business.\u00a0The Principal Investigator needs to be a full-time employee (at least 51%) of either the collaborating research institution or the small business, and must have a formal relationship with the small business.\u00a0The Principal Investigator for an STTR award must, however, devote at least 10% of his or her effort to the STTR project.\u00a0STTR awards also require that the collaborating research institution perform at least thirty percent (30%) of the award.\u00a0At least forty percent (40%) must be performed by the small business.\u00a0The remaining thirty percent (30%) of an STTR award may be performed by the small business, the research institution, or additional third parties.\nAs a non-profit research institution, the University is not permitted to apply for STTR grants on its own.\u00a0The University does, however, collaborate as a subcontractor with small businesses and receives funds through STTR subawards. University faculty and other members of the campus research community are encouraged to participate in STTR-funded research. \u00a0Startup companies formed by University inventors routinely seek STTR funding.\nWhile small business-related research is encouraged, it can give rise to specific conflict of interest and conflict of commitment concerns.\u00a0The University\u2019s Policy on Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests (Policy RP06, Formerly RA20, hereafter as the \u201cUniversity\u2019s Conflict of Interest Policy\u201d), addresses conflicts of interest in research. Additional conflicts and issues surrounding the use of University resources in connection with the performance of an STTR award can also arise where the University Personnel and\/or their immediate family are a co-founder and\/or have an ownership interest in the small business awardee. The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with federal regulations and the University\u2019s policies.\nDEFINITIONS:\nUnless otherwise defined herein, all terms in this Policy should have the same meaning as defined in the University's\u00a0Conflict of Interest Policy\u00a0and the\u00a0University\u2019s SBIR Collaboration Policy.\n\u201cUniversity Personnel\u201d means any faculty, investigator, employee, staff, and\/or any researcher, whether paid or unpaid, and including temporary or \u201cvisiting\u201d researcher or scientist appointments.\n\u201cImmediate Family\u201d means a spouse, domestic partner, or dependent children.\nSCOPE:\nThis Policy applies to all University Personnel, whether as a University employee or otherwise, in any research funded under a STTR award.\nPOLICY:\nAll University Personnel who intend to participate in an STTR subaward in any way with any small business must comply with this Policy, and all other applicable laws and University Policies.\nDISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENT:\nAll faculty members, employees, staff, investigators, and researchers are responsible for disclosing financial interests in accordance with the University\u2019s Conflict of Interest Policy.\u00a0In addition, faculty members, employees, investigators, and researchers are obligated to seek advice from the Office for Research Protections to discuss any possible conflict of interest prior to the University\u2019s acceptance of any STTR subaward.\u00a0Faculty members, employees, investigators, and researchers must also consult with the Office of Technology Management regarding any potential licensing or intellectual property issues prior to the University\u2019s acceptance of any STTR award.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES:\nParticipation in the STTR program requires observing the following principles:\nAll work performed for, or in connection with, any small business using University facilities, equipment, materials, employees, and\/or students related to an STTR must be performed under a fully negotiated and executed: (a) sponsored research agreement or (b) other agreement approved by the Office of Sponsored Programs, that is in compliance with the University\u2019s Policy on the Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies, and Services (Policy FN14); the University\u2019s Policy on Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services (Policy AD15); and the University\u2019s Policy on Private Consulting Practice (Policy AC80).\nNo University Personnel with an ownership interest, or whose Immediate Family has an ownership interest, in a small business entity may have sole responsibility to direct research at the University or use University resources (including facilities, equipment, employees, students, or other personnel) over which they exercise control (e.g., University assigned lab space and equipment and\/or students and employees assigned to work with such University personnel) related to an STTR award involving that same small business.\nIf University Personnel with an ownership interest, or whose Immediate Family has an ownership interest, in a small business entity proposes to direct research at the University or use University resources (including facilities, equipment, employees, students, or other personnel) over which they exercise control related to an STTR award involving that same small business, then appropriate controls must be in place to ensure appropriate oversight.\u00a0For example, if University Personnel proposes to act as the Principal Investigator on an STTR subaward from a small business in which they (or their Immediate Family) have an ownership interest, such an arrangement might be approved if, without limitation to other and\/or additional requirements, reviews and controls, the following controls are in place:The scope of the work to be performed by the University Personnel is deemed appropriate and in line with the research efforts within the University laboratory of the University Personnel serving as the Principal Investigator for the University\u2019s subaward; and3\nThe Conflict of Interest Committee reviews and approves subject to a management plan that could require a non-conflicted co-investigator and an independent statistician for data review.\n\nThe Principal Investigator for the University\u2019s subaward may not personally submit any proposals for any work to be performed using University facilities, equipment, materials, employees, and\/or students to be included in any submission by the small business to a funding agency for an STTR application.\u00a0Only University personnel with delegated signature authority to submit proposals on the University\u2019s behalf may submit such proposals. (See RA20 \u201cProposal Submission\u201d).\nA full-time (at least 51%) employee of the University may not be the Principal Investigator for a small business\u2019 STTR prime award.\nThe Principal Investigator for a small business and the Principal Investigator for the University subaward must be separate individuals, and may not be Immediate Family members.\nNo University Personnel are permitted to hold a management or officer position, a position as a member of the Board of Directors or the Scientific Advisory Board, or undertake any responsibilities with a small business having received STTR grants absent prior approval as required by University Policy AC80. Any such position or responsibilities must also be consistent with all other University policies, including the University\u2019s Policy on Engaging in Outside Professional Activities (Conflict of Commitment) (Policy AD77), and the University\u2019s Conflict of Interest Policy.\nNo University student, staff member, or visiting researcher or visiting scientist may perform research related to the University\u2019s portion of a small business\u2019 STTR award, and concurrently serve as an employee or intern of that small business.\nIf a small business applicant for an STTR award might require a license from the University for intellectual property prior to commencing research under the STTR award, the University requires that the small business promptly contact the University\u2019s Office of Technology Management sufficiently in advance of submitting its proposal to the sponsoring agency, in order to discuss the availability of relevant intellectual property and whether a license is needed.\nNo University Personnel may utilize their position at the University to influence or participate on behalf of a small business in making business decisions, or negotiating agreements, between that outside entity and the University.\nShould any violation or potential violation of these principles arise or be discovered at any time after the application for and\/or award of STTR-funded research, it is the obligation of the Investigator who discovers or becomes aware of such violation or potential violation to notify immediately the Office for Research Protections so that appropriate remedial action, if necessary, can be taken.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research, or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may also apply, especially:\nAC80 - Private Consulting Practice\nAD15 - Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services\nAD77 - Engaging in Outside Professional Activities (Conflict of Commitment)\nAD83 - Institutional Financial Conflict of Interest\nFN14 - Use of Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest\nRA06 - Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Collaboration\nRA20 - Proposal Submission\nRP03 - The Use of Human Participants in Research\nRP06\u00a0\u2013 Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests\nEffective Date: April 26, 2017\n\tDate Approved: April 26, 2017\n\tDate Published: April 26, 2017\nMost recent changes:\n\u00a0\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nApril 26, 2017- New policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish policies and guidelines for participation in the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program by Penn State and its employees."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy06","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) Safety Policy (Formerly Safety Glasses for Employees Working on Machine Tools) | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) Safety Policy (Formerly Safety Glasses for Employees Working on Machine Tools) \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY06\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) Safety Policy (Formerly Safety Glasses for Employees Working on Machine Tools)\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nApplicability\nReference\nDefinitions\nPolicy\nResponsibilities\nHazard Assessment\nPurchase of PPE\nTraining\nRecord Keeping\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy is applicable to all Penn State properties and work performed by Penn State employees regardless of job site location (except Hershey Medical Center and the College of Medicine).\nREFERENCE:\nThis program has been developed in accordance with the provisions of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.132 - 138, \"Personal Protective Equipment\".\nDEFINITIONS:\nAdministrative Controls: Focus on the interaction between an employee and a hazard. These controls involve the introduction of work practices that reduce the risk of injury or illness. Common examples of administrative controls include job rotation, training, and the development of standard operating procedures (SOPs).\nEngineering Controls: Focus on controlling a hazard at its source. The basic concept behind engineering controls is that work environments, equipment, and job tasks should be designed to eliminate or reduce exposure to hazards. Common examples of engineering controls include machine guarding, ventilation, and enclosure of noisy equipment.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE): Clothing which provides a physical barrier between a person and a known hazard.\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of Penn State University that all individuals who use Personal Protective Equipment follow appropriate procedures and be trained in accordance with this policy and the PPE Program.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nBudget Executives and Budget Administrators\nEnsure that responsibilities assigned within the PPE program are carried out within their administrative work unit.\nDesignate individuals responsible for the implementation of the PPE program within their work unit.\nMonitor implementation of the PPE program within their work unit.\nEnsure adequate funding is available to support the PPE program.\nDepartment of Environmental Health and Safety\nAssist work units in implementing the provisions of the PPE program.\nPeriodically review and update the PPE program as needed.\nSet minimum standards for PPE when applicable.\nProvide instruction to supervisors on how to conduct hazard assessments and train their employees on PPE.\nDevelop materials to support supervisors in training employees.\nSafety Officers\nDetermine the applicability of the PPE program to activities conducted within their work unit.\nCoordinate implementation of the PPE program within their work unit.\nEnsure PPE hazard assessments are performed and documented for work areas and\/or job tasks.\nEnsure that all affected employees within their work unit have been trained in accordance with this program.\nEnsure records of PPE hazard assessments and training are maintained by the work unit.\nAssist in the investigation of injuries and incidents within their work unit related to PPE usage or lack thereof.\nSupervisors\nBe thoroughly informed of the contents of the PPE program and how it applies to their areas of responsibility and authority.\nEnsure hazards are eliminated by engineering or administrative controls whenever feasible.\nConduct PPE Hazard Assessments for their area of authority.\nRe-evaluate PPE needs for work areas and\/or job tasks should any changes occur.\nProvide employees with appropriate PPE.\nEnsure employees receive PPE training.\nEvaluate, approve, and document any new articles of PPE, or changes in existing PPE, prior to use.\nEnsure employees comply with this program and take prompt corrective action when unsafe conditions or practices are observed.\nAttend all training required by this program.\nInvestigate injuries and incidents within their work unit related to PPE usage or lack thereof.\nEmployees\nComply with this program and use personal protective equipment as required.\nAttend all training required by this program.\nPromptly report any concerns related to PPE to their immediate supervisor.\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT:\nA \"hazard assessment\" is the process of identifying the hazards associated with a given task and prescribing personal protective equipment which must be utilized to reduce the risk. A certification of hazard assessment is a written document detailing the hazard assessment for a particular task. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that hazard assessments are performed and the certification(s) completed.\nPURCHASE OF PPE:\nAs specified by OSHA, the work unit must pay 100% of most forms of personal protective equipment (PPE). This includes respirators, hearing protection, non-prescription eye protection, face protection, head protection, fall protection, electrical PPE, hand protection, chemical resistant PPE, and flame resistant PPE.\nThere are only two exceptions to this rule at the University:\n1. The work unit or campus will provide partial reimbursement for the purchase of non-specialty protective footwear once a year as defined in the PSU PPE program.\nSpecialty footwear must be paid for by the work unit. This includes items that offer special protective qualities such as chemical resistance, electrical protection and static dissipation.\n2. The work unit or campus will provide reimbursement for one pair of prescription safety eyewear every other year as defined in the PSU PPE program.\nSpecialty eyewear must be paid for by the work unit. This includes prescription eyewear inserts for respirators, laser safety eyewear and welding eyewear.\nSpecific purchasing requirements for protective footwear and prescription safety glasses can be found in Appendix G of the Personal Protective Equipment program. The employer is not required to pay for everyday clothing such as long sleeve shirts, long pants, street shoes and normal work boots. The employer is also not required to pay for ordinary clothing, skin creams or other items used solely for protection from the weather such as winter coats, jackets, gloves, parkas, rubber boots, hats, raincoats, ordinary sunglasses, and sunscreen.\nTRAINING:\nEHS is responsible for training supervisors who have employees required to wear PPE. EHS will provide training to supervisors on the following topics:\nHow to complete PPE hazard assessments\nHow to train their employees on PPE\nSupervisors, Faculty, Principal Investigators, etc. are responsible for ensuring training is provided to their employees who are required to use PPE. Employees will be trained to know the following:\nWhen PPE is necessary\nWhat PPE is necessary\nHow to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE\nLimitations of PPE\nProper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of PPE\nRECORDKEEPING:\nEach work unit is responsible for maintaining the following records in order to meet the requirements of the PPE program:\u00a0EHS Forms:\nThe most recent versions of the PPE Hazard Assessment Worksheet (Appendix B).\nThe Summary of PPE Requirements (Appendix C).\nThe PPE Training Certification Form (Appendix D).\nEHS will maintain a listing of all individuals trained by EHS.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially the following:\nSY01 - Environmental Health and Safety Policy\nEffective Date: November 18, 2016\n\tDate Approved: November 2, 2016\n\tDate Published: November 18, 2016 (Editorial changes- November 18, 2016)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 18, 2016 - Editorial changes.

This written substantiation must include the following information:\nthe amount of cash and description of any property other than cash that was contributed;\nwhether the donee organization (PSU) provided any goods or services in consideration for the contribution;\na description and good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services provided in (2).\nThe ultimate responsibility for obtaining this substantiation lies with the donor; however, the University will assist the donor in this regard, so as not to jeopardize a benefactor's deduction (and thus future contributions to the University). Furthermore, the University should do nothing that would mislead the donor regarding the amount of the gift and its deductibility.\nFor additional information regarding IRS regulations, contact the Division of Development and AlumniRelations, 116 Old Main.\nInformation Disclosure for \"Quid Pro Quo\" Contributions:\nIn accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations, the University must provide a written statement to ALL donors making \"quid pro quo\" contributions in excess of $75-- meaning payments made in excess of $75 \"made partly as a contribution, and partly in consideration for goods or services provided to the donor by the University.\" This written statement must disclose the following:\ninform the donor that the amount of the contribution that is deductible for federal income tax purposes is limited to the excess of the amount of money (and value of any property other than money) contributed by the donor over the value of the goods or services provided by the University; and \nprovide the donor with a good-faith estimate of the value of goods or services furnished by the University.\nQuestions regarding current code, restrictions and\/or limitations regarding \u201cQuid Pro Quo\u201d contributions should be directed to the Office of Gift Planning.\nCONTRIBUTION PROCESSING:\nGeneral Acceptance Practices:\nTypically, gifts are solicited and initially accepted by the Office of University Development (OUD) personnel. Gifts of cash\/checks will be promptly deposited in accordance with Policy FN01. Other types of gifts are categorized in the sections that follow, along with their appropriate handling instructions.\nA Gift Reporting and Transmittal (GRT) form must be completed to initiate acceptance, acknowledgment and recordkeeping of gifts received as specified in the \"Purpose\" statement of the form instructions.\nSpecial Acceptance Situation\nUnrestricted Grants\nThere are times when contributions are received by a faculty or staff member of the University. Generally, these awards are given to the University in an unrestricted manner (i.e., no deliverables are required by the donor). Such awards must be promptly forwarded to the college\/campus\/administrative area's Research Office (or area that has been assigned this particular function by the area budget executive) with all corresponding supporting documentation, for processing in accordance with \"Disposition of Contributions Received,\" below, and RAG04 - Guidelines For Gifts, Grants and Contracts (The Funding Matrix).\nRestricted Grants\nLikewise, contributions are received meeting the above parameters, but are accompanied by certain terms, conditions or limitations to which the University must agree in accepting the funds. Like those gifts received without conditions, these monies must be taken, with all supporting data, to the college\/campus\/administrative area's Research Office (or area that has been assigned this particular function by the area budget executive) immediately upon receipt for processing in accordance with \"Disposition of Contributions Received,\" below. For additional information, contact the Office of Sponsored Programs.\nSplit Checks:\nChecks received that are split between gifts and contracts must be deposited immediately upon receipt as noted for all other checks in this policy. However, in order to ensure that the appropriate Fund number is properly credited, the Research Office (or area that has been assigned this particular function by the area budget executive) must specify the appropriate Fund number for the contract portion on the Report of Cash Receipts, ROCR, prior to the deposit of funds (as specified in \"Disposition of Contributions Received,\" below).\nDisposition of Contributions Received:\nCash\/Checks:\nIt is imperative that cash and checks are deposited as quickly as possible upon receipt, as mandated by Policy FN01 and Guideline FNG01. Likewise, it is important that monies are also deposited to the correct accounts. To facilitate this process, departments must promptly forward monies received to their Research Office (or applicable office, as designated by the area budget executive), along with the corresponding support documentation. The Research Office (or designated area) will subsequently prepare a Report of Cash Receipts (IBIS form \"ROCR\"). Monies will then be promptly forwarded for deposit, as established by the Financial Officer and in accordance with Policy FN01.\nNon-cash Gifts:\nNon-cash gifts must be processed promptly as well, as categorized and specified in the sections that follow (as applicable).\nSECURITIES:\nDonors who wish to donate appreciated securities to the University should be directed to the Office of Gift Planning in order that the appropriate asset delivery instructions may be provided. Delivery instructions vary based on how the asset is held (in brokerage, direct registration, physical certificates, closely held assets, restricted assets, etc.) and the ultimate gift purpose. Gifts of appreciated securities for the funding of charitable trusts and charitable gift annuities are not processed in the same manner as an outright gift of securities.\nMost securities can transfer electronically via the DTC (Depository Trust Company) system.\u00a0 Many mutual funds are held with transfer agents and require unique transfer forms. The process for the transfer of mutual funds held with a transfer agent typically take six weeks to fully process and complete. It is important to keep this timeframe in mind for calendar year-end contributions.\nThe University is not able to accept Savings Bonds, Series E, H, EE and HH Bonds.\nFor all gifts of securities, the Office of Gift Planning will work with the Corporate Controller\u2019s Office to value gifts as well as prepare all Gift Recording Transmittals (GRTs) to be submitted to the Office of Donor and Member Services for gift recording and acknowledgment.\nGIFTS-IN-KIND:\nAll material pertaining to gifts-in-kind must be taken to the Director of Development for that area\/unit. Except for gifts of real estate (see below), the Director of Development will acknowledge (to the donor) receipt of such gifts and prepare a Gift Reporting and Transmittal (GRT) form. The GRT and all support must be forwarded to the Office of Gift Planning at University Park per FNG01. The Office of Donor and Member Services will distribute GRT copies and supporting documents to other University departments who need this information, and initiate formal acceptance and acknowledgment of the gift- in-kind to the donor.\nGifts-in-Kind accepted by Penn State University are to be valued at fair market value. In determining fair market value (FMV), the University can rely on any of the following: (1) information provided by the donor to the IRS; (2)a qualified appraisal by someone who holds himself out in the industry as an expert; and\/or (3) other pricing information including but not limited to retail pricing, comparisons to prior purchases or like item pricing. In the case of software, FMV can also be determined based on OUD's internal software evaluation policy. With specific regard to the valuation of gifts-in-kind of equipment from a corporation and valued at greater than or equal to $5,000, OUD will not record the gift until FMV as described above is determined and documented in writing.\nGIFTS OF REAL ESTATE:\nReal property may be accepted for an outright gift or bargain sale with the agreement of the Treasurer\u2019s Office. A gift of real property will be subject to the following requirements:\nPersonal inspection by staff\nTitle search\nMinimum of level one environmental audit\nMarketability review by at least two knowledgeable brokers\nQualified appraisal obtained by the donor\nWritten agreement by the donor to provide additional funds, if necessary, to provide for ongoing expenses and maintenance of the property until sold\nCompleted real estate checklist, including detailed financial information on the property if it is commercial real property\nMortgaged real property may not be accepted. Donors who own mortgaged real property should be encouraged to pay off or transfer the mortgage before making the gift.\nDonors should be informed that the University accepts gifts of real property provided that the property is readily marketable. It is the preference of the University to arrange sales of real property on a cash basis.\nReal property may not be accepted into a charitable remainder trust or charitable lead trust when the University is named as the trustee, unless a special exception is granted by the Corporate Controller. Donors wanting to use real property to fund a trust should be encouraged to establish a flip unitrust and to serve initially as their own trustee. In this situation, the University may be named the successor trustee of the trust once the property has been sold. Acceptance of trusteeship at that time will be subject to the review and approval of the Corporate Controller.\nThe Board of Trustees needs to approve land and other real estate to be considered for purchase or sale, with the exception of the sale of land and other real estate up to $3 million in value, gifted to the University for the express purpose of sale with proceeds benefitting the University. Proceeds from the sale of land and other real estate gifted to the University for the express purpose of sale up to $3 million is reported to the Board of Trustees.\nFor all gifts of real estate, the Office of Gift Planning will coordinate evaluation and acceptance between the donor and the University, working through the Corporate Controller's Office. The Office of Gift Planning must be involved in any communication or negotiation with the donor. If the gift is acceptable to the University, the Corporate Controller's Office will handle formal acceptance and closure. The Office of Gift Planning will prepare and submit the GRT form indicating how the gift will be receipted to the donor. As with other gifts in kind, the Office of Gift Planning will also coordinate the processing of an 8283 form (see above).\nSCHOLARSHIPS, AWARDS, FELLOWSHIPS AND MISCELLANEOUS LOAN SOURCES:\nFor scholarships and fellowships that are NOT processed as Unrestricted Grants (like those discussed in \"Special Acceptance Situations\"), processing will occur as discussed here. Any cash or checks received for scholarships, awards, fellowships, and loan fund sources must be taken to the Director of Development for completion of a Gift Reporting and Transmittal (GRT)  form and Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) . The Director of Development will then subsequently forward the cash or checks (with pertinent supporting information) for deposit, as established by the Financial Officer and in accordance with Policy FN01.\nFor gifts to established University scholarships, awards, fellowships and loan fund sources, the deposit will be to the Gifts Account 06800. Check with Student Financial Services for appropriate final destination budget\/fund numbers to enter on the GRT form where required.\nFor gifts for proposed scholarships, awards, fellowships and loan fund sources, deposits will be to the Gifts Account 06800. Funds are transferred to the appropriate budget\/fund numbers when allocation codes are assigned.\nWhen the deposit is made, all supporting material and a copy of the check are returned to the Director of Development, who will in turn forward the information to the Office of Donor and Member Services at University Park. The document number of the ROCR involved with this deposit\/transaction must also be indicated in the documentation to assist in verification by the Office of Donor and Member Services that the money was indeed deposited\/credited to the correct budget and fund number. (Refer to Policy FN09, \"Processing Scholarship\/Award\/Grant Monies\" section for information concerning further processing of University scholarships.)\nFor outside scholarships (defined as having no University Board of Trustees guidelines for awarding, but identifying a specific student recipient), the deposit must be to Budget 09-056-057, Fund 19700, Object Code 040. Deposit activity to this budget\/fund automatically generates a report to Student Financial Services, which is used to identify and post such awards to the correct student's account.\nPRESIDENTIAL RESPONSE:\nNotification of all gifts and contributions requiring acknowledgment by the President must be received by the Office of the President within five (5) working days of receipt by the University. Since the Office of Donor and Member Services must provide this notification, processing of such gifts and contributions by receiving areas must assure prompt transmittal of information to the Office of Donor and Member Services at University Park.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual may apply, especially:\nFN01 - Processing Cash Revenues,\nFN09 - Scholarships, and\nFNG01 - Flow and Accountability of Gifts and Grants from Non-Governmental Sources.\nEffective Date: July 28, 2016\n\tDate Approved: July 27, 2016\n\tDate Published: July 28, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nJuly 28, 2016 - Changes made in the SECURITIES and GIFTS OF REAL ESTATE sections to reflect the reassignment of these responsibilities from the Office of Investment Management to the Corporate Controller's Office.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Specifically, the scope of this policy includes:\nFaculty, staff, students, workforce members, visitors to the University, including, but not limited to, visiting scholars, lecturers\/instructors, and\/or all units and other persons who are acting on, for, or on behalf of the University;\nAll institutional data, including but not limited to administrative, teaching and learning, clinical, licensed, or any other data related to the University;\nThird-party vendors who collect, process, share, transmit or maintain university institutional data, whether managed or hosted internally or externally; and\nAll devices that access or maintain institutional data.\nPOLICY:\nI. GENERAL INFORMATION SECURITY:\nThis policy establishes University-wide strategies and responsibilities for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets that are created, accessed, managed, and\/or controlled by the University. Information Assets addressed by the policy include data, information systems, computers, network devices, as well as paper documents.\nWith this policy and corresponding standards, the University will:\nEstablish and maintain a unified institution-wide information assurance program and cybersecurity risk management framework;\nEstablish and maintain institution-wide security policies, guidelines, and standards which provide boundaries within which individuals and units will operate;\nProtect institutional data, systems, resources, and services against unauthorized access and other threats or attacks that could potentially result in financial, legal, or reputational harm to the University, members of the University community, or third parties to which the University owes a reasonable duty of care;\nEducate faculty, staff, students, and units on the need for appropriate cybersecurity, and protecting themselves against breach of their systems and unauthorized access to their personal information;\nEstablish an exception process for individuals and units with unique needs;\nSupport compliance with applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations, and University policies, guidelines, contracts and agreements that obligate the University to implement security safeguards; and\nEnsure Penn State's core mission is not impeded while ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of university information assets, and reducing and better managing cybersecurity risks.\nII. GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION SECURITY:\nAll faculty, staff, students, and units have an obligation to protect institutional data in accordance with this policy and its supplemental Guidelines and Standards, which take into consideration the University's mission, as well as the level of sensitivity and criticality of the information. The University promotes, supports and adopts an institutional culture that elevates the importance of its overall information security posture by implementation of the following principles:\nOne Enterprise Information Assurance Program: The University will remain consistent and adopt one unified approach to information assurance across all campuses and units. It will incorporate security, privacy, risk management, and disaster recovery best practices throughout the information life-cycle, including, but not limited to, the University's enterprise architecture, system and application development, research projects, clinical applications, and IT hardware and software.\nThe University recognizes that it is organizationally and functionally complex and that campus units, research programs, and clinical care settings will have unique needs, as well as different threats and risk tolerances. Consequently, variation in how this policy and its supporting Guidelines and Standards are implemented will be managed and tracked by the Office of Information Security (OIS) through an exception process.\nShared Responsibilities: All members of the University community have individual and shared responsibilities to protect the University's information assets and comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and University policies.\nInformation Centric: Required security controls are based on the sensitivity of the information. Systems with information classified as \"Restricted\" or \"High\" will have much more restrictive controls, while the University will tolerate more risk with information classified as \"Moderate\" or \"Low.\" Security controls are determined by the highest classification level of information present on the system.\nLocation Independence: Information will be hosted by central IT organizations, unit IT organizations and third party cloud providers. Regardless of where the information resides, the same standards will apply to University data.\nAppropriate Use: Faculty, staff, students, and units will act in accordance with the principles included in AD96, Acceptable Use of University Information Resources.\nRisk Management and Acceptance: The Office of Information Security will establish, implement, and maintain a University-wide cybersecurity risk management framework based upon widely accepted national standards. The University, individual units, and, where appropriate, research environments will be responsible for ensuring faculty, staff, students, and units are educated in the area of risk level and management, and conducting annual risk assessments of information systems and applications which store, process, or transmit information classified as \"High\" and \"Restricted.\" These assessments help to identify risk and appropriately prioritize mitigation strategies that reasonably protect critical infrastructure and services. Having appropriately trained faculty, staff, students, and units allows the University to appropriately allocate resources to reduce information security risk to a level deemed appropriate by University leadership.\nStandards-based: The University will leverage nationally recognized security standards where appropriate and in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.\nPrivacy: The University will balance its cybersecurity obligations with the reasonable privacy expectation of its faculty, staff, students, and units in relation to their personally identifiable information, with the exceptions referenced in AD53, Privacy Policy. Penn State's Privacy Officer will collaboratively develop and maintain privacy policies, standards, guidelines, and best practices to meet legal and compliance obligations.\nContinuous Monitoring: The University will monitor, on an ongoing basis, the security technologies and controls that support this policy, compliance with applicable state and federal requirements, and changes to the University's information systems and technology environment.\nIII. CLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION:\nThe University will use Information Classification to develop Policies, Guidelines and Standards for risk-based protection of information and systems. Information Classifications are based upon the expected risk of harm to individuals and the University if the information were to be subject to unauthorized access or disclosure. Harm may encompass negative psychological, reputational, financial, personal safety, legal, and\/or other ramifications to individuals or the University. The classification of information determines the baseline security protections and controls that are appropriate. The University's identified\/designated Data Owners are primarily responsible for the implementation of appropriate safeguards and controls, and the safeguards for the highest classification of information applies. Definitions and basic principles of Information Classification are provided below and further supplemented in the supporting Standards.\nNote that the examples provided are illustrative, rather than exhaustive. The University, faculty, staff, students, and units will interact with many more specific types of information. In the event that a specific type of information is not listed as an example, the Information Classification will be based upon the Definition of each Classification.\nInformation Classification\nSensitive Information Classification\nDefinition\nExamples\nRestricted (Level 4)\nAccess and use is strictly controlled and restricted by laws, regulations, or contracts. Unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss will have significant legal consequences, including civil and criminal penalties, loss of funding, inability to continue current research, and inability to obtain future funding or partnerships.\n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Data\nData subject to Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) moderate or high standards\n\nHigh (Level 3)\nUnauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss is likely to have significant and severe adverse effects for individuals, groups, or the University. These adverse effects could include, but are not limited to, social, psychological, reputational, financial, or legal harm. Compliance requires are not as strict as for Restricted Information.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) as defined in Privacy Policy AD53\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) data\n\nModerate (Level 2)\nUnauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss is likely to have adverse effects for individuals, groups, or the University, but will not have a significant impact on the University. These adverse effects could include but are not limited to social, psychological, reputational, financial, or legal harm.\n\nNon-PII student records\nPersonnel records\n\nLow (Level 1)\nUnauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss is likely to have low or no risk to individuals, groups, or the University. These adverse effects may, but are unlikely to, include limited reputational, psychological, social, or financial harm. Low Risk Information may include some non-public data.\n\nData made freely available by public sources\nPublished data\nEducational data\nInitial and intermediate Research Data\n\nInstructions on handling information classification levels can be located in the standards listed in Section V. OIS will work with Data Owners to determine appropriate classification, as necessary. The CISO will make the final determination when the Data Owner and OIS cannot agree. For informational questions regarding your information classification, please contact security@psu.edu.\nIV. USE OF APPROVED IT SERVICES:\nApproved information technology infrastructure, services, staff training and facilities are a key method to securing information at the University. Faculty, staff, students, or units, should give preference to utilization of approved IT services where such services are available and appropriate to meet the individual's needs. These approved IT services will be designed to follow specific, level-appropriate information security requirements based on the strategic risk the information represents as well as regulatory and contractual compliance requirements.\nV. ADHERENCE TO IT SECURITY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:\nThis policy also recognizes the need to accommodate unique research, teaching, and clinical needs that may not be feasible to accomplish through the use of approved IT services. If an approved IT service is not appropriate to meet the needs of faculty, staff, students, or units, level-appropriate information security requirements must be implemented per University Standards. Implementation for each Standard can be located below (click on the link):\nAccess, Authentication, and Authorization Management\nDisaster Recovery Planning for Information Systems and Services\nElectronic Data Disposal and Media Sanitization\nEncryption\nInformation Assurance and IT Security Awareness, Training, and Education\nInformation Security Risk Management\nNetwork Security\nPhysical Security\nRequests for Exception to Information Security Policy\nSecure Coding and Application Security\nSecurity of Enterprise Application Integration\nSecurity Log Collection, Analysis, and Retention\nThird Party Vendor Security and Compliance\nVulnerability Management\nThis Information Security Policy is supported and supplemented by specific operational, procedural, and technical Guidelines and Standards. These Standards will be enforced in the same manner as this policy.\nEach Standard will be owned by a Standard Working Group. The Working Group will be representative of the standard stakeholders and will be led by an OIS staff member and will include members of faculty and\/or staff. The Standard Working Groups will be chartered by the CISO. The Standard Working Groups will review their Standard at least quarterly, incorporating input from the University community, changes in the threat, compliance standards, technology and industry best practices.\nVI. CERTIFICATION OF UNIT-BASED SYSTEM SECURITY:\nAny unit or individual that operates IT systems and\/or applications that process information classified as High or Restricted under this policy must have Authority to Operate granted by the Office of Information Security. OIS will grant this authority after performing proper due diligence confirming that the information is properly secured and meeting any compliance requirements. Prior to obtaining the Authority to Operate, a unit or individual may have provisional Authority to Operate by informing OIS and certifying to OIS that the information is properly secured and meeting compliance requirements. OIS is responsible for the processes that grant Authority to Operate and provisional Authority to Operate.\nVII. ACCEPTABLE USE:\nTo create a secure environment in which faculty, staff, students, and units may feel free to create and collaborate without fear that the products of their efforts will be violated by misrepresentation, tampering, destruction, or theft, all individuals must follow AD96, Acceptable Use of University Information Resources.\nVIII. SECURITY LIAISON:\nEach unit at the University will appoint a Security Liaison. This person will be a conduit for communication between the Office of Information Security (OIS) and the unit. This person does not have to be a security specialist or an IT specialist. However, if the unit has dedicated security staff or an individual who has security duties, then they are the preferred liaison. OIS will maintain a list, complete with contact information. OIS will provide training to all Security Liaisons.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nThis matrix spells out the responsibility of high level groups for high level functions. Other more detailed responsibilities may be specified in the Guidelines and Standards.\nResponsibilities\n\u00a0\nUniversity Leaders\nDeans, Chancellors, Unit Directors,\n\t\t\t\t\u200bPrincipal Investigators\nCISO\/OIS\nUnit Security Staff\nIT Leaders\nGovernance\nData Owner\nRisk\nAccountable Responsible\nConsulted\nResponsible\nInformed\nConsulted\nConsulted\nConsulted\nStrategy and Policy\nResponsible\nConsulted\nAccountable Responsible\nConsulted\nConsulted\nConsulted\nConsulted\nIdentification\nInformed\nAccountable Responsible\nResponsible\nResponsible\nResponsible\nInformed\nResponsible\nProtection\nInformed\nAccountable\nResponsible\nResponsible\nResponsible\nConsulted\nInformed\nDetection\nInformed\nInformed\nAccountable Responsible\nResponsible\nResponsible\nConsulted\nInformed\nResponse\nInformed\nInformed\nAccountable\nConsulted\nResponsible\nN\/A\nInformed\nRecover\nInformed\nAccountable\nConsulted\nConsulted\nResponsible\nN\/A\nInformed\nFunctions:\nRisk: The identification, categorization, and oversight of the risk toleration of the University.\nStrategy and Policy: The long term direction for how the University will allocate its resources to meet the appropriate risk level.\nIdentification: Knowing and reporting the location, type and sensitivity of information assets in the area of responsibility.\nProtection: Implementation of the safeguards required to adequately protect the information in the area of responsibility.\nDetection: Detecting attempts, unauthorized access, or misuse of information or other cybersecurity event.\nResponse: Conduct appropriate actions in response to a cybersecurity event.\nRecovery: Conduct the appropriate activities to restore any capabilities impacted by a cybersecurity event and take appropriate corrective measures.\nRoles:\nUniversity Leaders: Senior Administrators who determine strategy for the University.\nDeans, Chancellors, Unit Directors and Principal Investigators: Leaders who lead a college, campus, academic or administrative unit. These are the Data Owners.\nCISO\/OIS: Chief Information Security Officer and the Office of Information Security.\nUnit Security Staff: Staff who are fully or partially responsible for information security in their unit.\nIT Leaders: Leaders responsible for IT in a unit or one of the administrative units whose mission is IT. Includes the University CIO. In the case of IT units, the IT Leader may also be the Data Owner.\nGovernance: The committees that provide advice to IT leaders and the CISO. Examples are the President's Council, Academic Leadership Council, Faculty Senate, CISO Advisory Committee, among others.

Committed cost sharing is specifically identified in a grant proposal.\u00a0 Uncommitted is cost sharing which was not identified in the grant proposal, but must be treated as cost sharing to assure appropriate allocation and treatment of costs.\nCOMMITTED -\nMandatory: Required as a condition to receive an award, and specified by the agency in the proposal guidelines or program announcement. This would be the minimum cost sharing\u00a0required\u00a0by the agency. Anything committed beyond the minimum becomes Voluntary Committed cost sharing.\nVoluntary: Committed by the University through the inclusion in the proposal as a\u00a0specific\u00a0commitment. This commitment could appear in the proposal either in the administrative\/business section (e.g. budget or budget justification) or the narrative. \u00a0\u00a0Note that per the Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306: (a) Under Federal research proposals, voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected. It cannot be used as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals, but may be considered if it is both in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations and specified in a notice of funding opportunity. Criteria for considering voluntary committed cost sharing and any other program policy factors that may be used to determine who may receive a Federal award must be explicitly described in the notice of funding opportunity.\nCommitted Cost Sharing - both mandatory and voluntary - are accounted for in the same ways and must be properly documented for cost accounting purposes. Note: The nature of uncommitted cost sharing (see below) changes to committed as soon as it is included in the proposal budget or award.\nUNCOMMITTED -\nUniversity expenses, such as faculty salaries, over and above that which is committed and budgeted for in a sponsored agreement.\nUncommitted cost sharing is not and must not be identified specifically in the proposal budget or award or any modification, and must not be documented or accounted for as part of the award.\nAdditionally, uncommitted cost sharing, per clarification in\u00a0Memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001, \"must be treated differently from committed effort and should not be included in the organized research base for computing the F&A rate or reflected in any allocation of F&A costs\". Given this requirement, uncommitted cost share has specific requirements for documentation, which are outlined in RAG50 \u2013 Documentation of Cost Sharing.\u00a0\nSPECIFIC GUIDANCE:\nAny shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including cash and third party in kind, must be accepted by the Federal agency as part of the University's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria:\nAre verifiable from the University's records,\nAre not included as contributions for any other federal award,\nAre necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of project or program objectives,\nAre allowable under the applicable cost principles,\nAre not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where authorized by Federal statute\n\t\tto be used for cost sharing or matching,\nAre provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency,\nConform to other provisions of the UG, as applicable. (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(b))\nVALUATION:\nUniversity Services and Property\nValues for University contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles of Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200 Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorized universities to donate buildings or land for construction\/facilities acquisition projects or long term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching purposes shall be the lesser of:\nThe value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the University's accounting records at the time of donation, or\nThe current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value at the time of donation to the project (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(d)).\nVolunteer Services\nVolunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the University's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the University organization, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the University competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, necessary, allocable and otherwise allowable, may be included in the valuation (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(e)).\nThird Party Employer Services\nWhen an employer other than the University furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, necessary, allocable and otherwise allowable, and, indirect costs at either the third-party's approved federally negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.414(d), provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(f))\nDonated Equipment or Property\nDonated property from third-parties may include such items as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated property included in the cost sharing or matching share must not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(g)).\nThe method used for determining cost sharing or matching for third-party donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the University may differ according to the purpose of Federal award, if (1) or (2) apply:\nIf the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the University in the acquisition of the equipment, buildings or land, the total aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching, or\nIf the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges. \u00a0(See also Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.420)\nThe value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the University, with the following qualifications:\nThe value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the University as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the University,\nThe value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation,\nThe value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately owned building in the same locality,\nThe value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value,\nThe following requirement pertains to the University's supporting records for in kind contributions from third parties:\nFair market value of goods and services must be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the University for its own internal transactions.\nDOCUMENTATION OF COST SHARING:\nGrants and contracts that have any component of committed cost sharing \u2013 mandatory or voluntary \u2013 must appropriately document the requirement.\u00a0 See RAG50 \u2013 Documentation of Cost Sharing for detail.\u00a0\nCOST SHARING OF F&A COSTS:\nThe Uniform Guidance states:\nUnrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing or matching may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the non-Federal entity's approved negotiated indirect cost rate\u00a0(Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(c)).\nBefore seeking prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, PIs must obtain internal approval to include F&A costs in cost sharing. Although the University is firmly committed to assisting faculty in the pursuit of external funding for research initiatives and program development, the resources available for cost sharing are limited. Therefore, all cost sharing must be approved by appropriate institutional officials who administer the sources of cost-sharing funds. All cost sharing must be documented in accordance with University and sponsoring agency policies.\nRequests for cost sharing of F&A costs or for institutional cost sharing through the use of F&A costs must be submitted to the Office of Sponsored Programs as detailed in Policy RA30 \u2013 Facilities and Administrative (F&A) Costs. Cost sharing of F&A must be noted when the account is established in IBIS (AURA form).\nSPECIAL ADDITIONAL RULES FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:\nProperty\/Facilities purchased or provided in fulfillment of committed cost sharing must be reported to Cost Analysis and Property Inventory by the College\/Unit Financial Officer (or delegate).\nEquipment: There are additional actions that must be taken to ensure that equipment is properly coded in the University's Property\/Inventory records. The equipment should be accounted for in the appropriate cost sharing cost center and reported to Cost Analysis and Property Inventory.\nUNIVERSITY MATCHING FUNDS:\nThe University may provide matching funds to be used for committed cost sharing purposes. Essentially, these matching funds are used to offset the committed cost-sharing requirement for a particular area. These allocations, approved by the Vice President for Research, should be accounted for as part of the budget in the Cost Sharing Account in the cost center for the particular agreement. In addition, any cost sharing committed at the college or departmental level should also be accounted for as part of the budget in the Cost Sharing Account.\nIf matching funds provided by the University are treated as uncommitted cost sharing (such as for NSF grants which do not permit committed cost sharing), these costs must be managed and reported as per RAG50 under Uncommitted.\nThe University has several guidelines to manage the allocation of central matching funds:\nRAG51 - Central Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment\nRAG52 -Central Matching Funds Program for Assistantships \/ Traineeships\nRAG53 \u2013 Coordination Process for Matching Funds and Other University Contributions to Multi-Unit Proposals\nRequests for University matching funds also must be submitted a minimum of 10 days before the proposal is due. Retroactive requests after the proposal is funded will not be approved.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially the following:\nRA10 - Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards\nRA30 - Facilities and Administrative (F&A) Costs\nRAG50 \u2013 Documentation of Cost Sharing\nRAG51 - Central Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment\nRAG52 - Central Matching Funds Program for Assistantships \/ Traineeships\nRAG53 \u2013 Coordination Process for Matching Funds and Other University Contributions to Multi-Unit Proposals\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating parts of old RA02 and RAG10) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMarch 7, 2005 - Editorial changes to correct link to \u0093The Clarification of OMB A-21 Treatment of Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing and Tuition Remission Costs.\"\nNew Policy Guideline; formerly University procedure CR2074 - University \"Matching\" Funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish policies with respect to the proper use and accounting for cost sharing for sponsored awards.\u00a0Cost sharing or match is defined in the\u00a0Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.29\u00a0as the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds.The Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306 Cost sharing or matching\u00a0outlines cost sharing requirements for grants and cooperative agreements and provides specific guidance on cost sharing.

\nCross References\n\n\nPOLICY:\nFinancial or business interests of the University or of University Officials must be identified, disclosed and reviewed for potential institutional conflicts of interest according to the processes set forth below.\u00a0 Institutional financial interests can be created by gifts, payments, royalty income, equity and other financial benefits from or interests in for-profit entities.\u00a0 Institutional financial interests can also be created by financial and fiduciary interests of University Officials.\u00a0 When an institutional conflict of interest is identified, a management plan will be implemented to manage, reduce, or eliminate the institutional conflict.\u00a0 The University\u2019s Institutional Conflict of Interest Committee shall review and evaluate the financial or business interests of the University or of University Officials to identify potential institutional conflicts of interest; shall create, in collaboration with the appropriate University officials or offices, management plans to manage, reduce or eliminate institutional conflicts of interest that are identified; and shall provide oversight to the implementation and monitoring of management plans created.\u00a0 The Institutional Conflict of Interest Committee may also implement additional administrative procedures associated with this policy in order to assist in its responsibilities outlined here.\u00a0 The University will strive to manage or eliminate each institutional conflict of interest identified before any contract, sponsored project, dedicated gift, or transaction is executed; any contractual relationship is initiated; or any action is taken that might be inappropriately affected or appear to be inappropriately affected by the institutional conflict of interest.\u00a0 Potential conflicts of interest that involve members of the Board of Trustees are covered by the conflict of interest provisions applicable to Trustees in the University Bylaws.\nDEFINITIONS:\nConflict of Interest Official (COIO): The COIO is the Associate Vice President for Research and Director of the Office for Research Protections (ORP), who also serves as the COIO pursuant to the University\u2019s individual conflict of interest policy, RP06.\u00a0 The Associate Vice President for Research and Director of the ORP reports directly to the Vice President for Research for all administrative matters pertaining to the Associate Vice President and Director position.\u00a0 For matters related directly to this policy and to institutional conflicts of interest, the COIO shall report to the President.\u00a0 If the institutional conflict of interest matter involves the President, the COIO shall report directly to the Chairperson of the University\u2019s Board of Trustees.\u00a0 The COIO is responsible for developing, promulgating, and updating procedures and guidelines for the implementation of this policy and for providing administrative support to the ICOI Committee.\u00a0 The COIO is also responsible for reviewing all reports and disclosures submitted under this policy, determining which disclosures and potential institutional conflicts of interest must be reviewed by the ICOI Committee, and for informing the ICOI Committee of all potential ICOI situations handled by the COIO.\u00a0 The COIO may delegate its responsibilities under this policy to staff within the ORP.\nInstitutional Conflict of Interest (ICOI): A situation in which the financial or business interests of the University, or of a University Official acting within his or her authority on behalf of the University, can inappropriately affect or reasonably appear to inappropriately affect the research, teaching, outreach, business transaction or other activities of the University.\nInstitutional Conflict of Interest Committee (ICOI Committee): A committee appointed by the President to evaluate institutional conflict of interest situations; to develop, in collaboration with the appropriate University officials or offices, conflict of interest management plans; to review and assist with the monitoring of management plans developed; to review reports made by the Conflict of Interest Official; to review information relating to post-approval implementation and monitoring of conflict of interest management plans; and to recommend corrective actions and\/or sanctions for non-compliance with this policy.\u00a0 The ICOI Committee shall be comprised of at least five (5) voting members, including at least one senior leader at the University with sufficient independence, expertise and seniority; at least one faculty member; a representative from the Office of Internal Audit; a senior representative from the College of Medicine; and the Conflict of Interest Official.\u00a0 The Associate Vice-President for Research and Technology Transfer, the Vice-President for Development or his\/her designee, a staff member from the Office for Research Protections, and General Counsel will serve as non-voting\/ex-officio members of the ICOI Committee.\nInstitutional Financial Interests: means the following financial or business interests of the University:\nRoyalty arrangements: payments, including royalty payments and licensing fees, resulting from technology transfer, licensing, and business activities that, for each arrangement, exceed $100,000 in the preceding twelve (12) month period;\nNon-publicly traded equity: equity and ownership interests of any amount in any for-profit entity that is not publicly traded:\nPublicly-traded equity: equity and ownership interests valued at greater than $100,000 in the preceding twelve (12) month period in any publicly-traded, for-profit entity, except for equity held in the University\u2019s endowment (please see note below); and\nGifts greater than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) from any for-profit entity or philanthropic unit associated with a for-profit entity (please see note below).\nNote about gifts: Gifts, pledges, and solicitation of gifts to the University are important to its mission.\u00a0 However, no charitable donation is allowed to be contingent upon the outcome of any research conducted at or by the University.\u00a0 The University hereby affirms that it will not solicit or accept gifts that in any way limit the ability of its investigators to conduct and\/or report the results of research in accordance with the highest scientific, medical, professional, and ethical standards.\u00a0\nThe goal of this policy is not to preclude the University from accepting philanthropy from companies that sponsor research or otherwise conduct business with the University.\u00a0 Rather, the policy is intended to help the University develop means of identifying and examining such circumstances, and of managing, through disclosures, separation of responsibilities, and as otherwise appropriate, any actual or apparent conflicts of interest that may result.\nThe University hereby affirms that the Office of Investment Management, and its outside investment managers, are forbidden from communicating with University Officials or University investigators concerning the conduct and interpretation of ongoing or planned research performed at the University for the purpose of influencing investment decisions.\u00a0 Maintaining this robust \u201cfirewall\u201d is essential for ensuring the core activities of the University are not affected, or perceived to be affected, by the University\u2019s interests in maximizing the value of its endowment pool.\u00a0 If an individual becomes aware of a situation in which there appears to be a conflict of interest involving philanthropic gifts, solicitation of gifts, or management of the endowment pool, the individual must notify the ICOI Committee or the COIO for review and determination as outlined below.\nCertain other payment or financial benefits: from time to time, the University enters into contractual relationships with outside parties which include a payment or other financial benefit to the University from the contracting party that are based on factors outside the course of business between the University and the contracting party (e.g., number of units sold or new accounts established, philanthropic support for the University).\u00a0 The University recognizes that certain types of these contracts, if not properly managed or disclosed by the University, and which because of the University\u2019s unique position and relationships, may create the perception that the University was improperly influenced to enter into the contract or endorses the contracting party as a \u201cpreferred provider\u201d or may improperly influence consumer choices by third parties, in particular University students.\nThe COIO, in coordination with the contracting units, shall make reasonable efforts to identify these types of contracts for review by the ICOI Committee or the COIO under authority granted from the Committee.\nInstitutional Financial Interests shall also mean the following financial or business interests of University Officials (and those of the University Official\u2019s spouse or partner):\nEquity and\/or ownership interests in publicly-traded, for-profit entities if the value exceeds $25,000 in the preceding twelve (12) month period.\u00a0 Not included are equity or ownership interests in mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the University Official does not directly control the investment decisions made in these investment vehicles;\nEquity (including stock, options, warrants), ownership, or founders\u2019 interests of any amount in non-publicly traded entities;\nIncome, including royalties, equity, consulting fees, honoraria and gifts or other payments, from for-profit entities that, in the aggregate, exceed $25,000 from each entity in the preceding twelve (12) month period;\nAny fiduciary role with a for-profit entity, regardless of compensation or income, such as service on the board of directors, management role in a company or partnership (e.g., President, CEO, COO, or Treasurer).\nAny fiduciary role with a non-profit entity that could reasonably lead to a potential institutional conflict of interest.\nUniversity Activities: Research, teaching, outreach, business transactions or other activities performed by or on behalf of the University.\nUniversity Officials: Persons holding the following positions, including those persons holding these positions in a temporary or interim capacity:\nPresident\nVice President\nProvost\nVice Provost\nMembers of President\u2019s Council\nAssociate Vice President for Finance and Business\nAssociate Vice President for Physical Plant\nAssociate Vice President for Auxiliary Business Services\nAssociate Vice President for Police and Public Safety\nAssistant or Associate Vice President for Research\nChancellor\nChief Academic Officer of Commonwealth Campuses\nDean\nAssociate or Vice Deans for Research\nDirector of the Applied Research Laboratory\nCorporate Controller\nUniversity Budget Officer\nAssistant Treasurer\nNCAA

Committee, Institutional Biosafety Committee, stem cell review committee; and\nVoting and non-voting members of the Institutional Conflict of Interest Committee\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nA. Disclosure Reports by Certain Offices\nEach of the following offices shall designate a responsible person and report at least semi-annually to the COIO all Institutional Financial Interests of the University as defined above in their designated areas and shall update their reports as needed:\nOffice of Technology Management (for licensing arrangements, patents, invention disclosures and any associated royalties or other fees);\nOffice of Sponsored Programs (for sponsored research agreements and federal and state research grants or contracts);\nOffice of Development (for gifts);\nOffice of General Counsel (for institutional contracts or business partnerships);\nOffice of the Corporate Controller (for institutional contracts or business partnerships);\nRisk Management Office (for institutional contracts or business partnerships);\nB. Disclosure by University Officials\n\tUniversity Officials shall disclose all Institutional Financial Interests (as defined above) at least annually and shall update their disclosures as new Institutional Financial Interests arise.\u00a0 This disclosure requirement does not affect the disclosure requirements and other responsibilities outlined under University Policy RP06, Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests, which may apply to the University Official.\n\n\tC.\u00a0 Review and Determination\n\tAdministration of ICOI matters will be handled by the COIO and his\/her staff.\u00a0 The COIO shall be responsible for (i) the review of all reports of activities described above and all annual disclosures made by University Officials in order to determine whether they are Institutional Financial Interests that could lead to a potential ICOI and (ii) if so, referral to the ICOI Committee in order to determine whether there is an ICOI, unless the Committee has delegated its authority to the COIO to make this determination.\n1. Review of the University\u2019s Institutional Financial Interest:\nThe University shall use reasonable efforts to manage potential ICOI matters prior to finalization of the proposed University transaction (e.g., prior to the gift, contract, or sponsored project being executed or accepted) that gives rise to the potential ICOI. In order to do this, the COIO shall semi-annually provide a list of entities in which there has been a disclosed Institutional Financial Interest of the University to the following offices:\nOffice of Technology Management;\nOffice of Sponsored Programs;\nOffice of Development;\nOffice of General Counsel;\nOffice of the Corporate Controller;\nRisk Management Office;\nProcurement Services; and\nOffice for Research Protections\/IRB.\nResponsible staff in the above identified offices will notify the COIO when a proposed transaction with one of the entities on the list arises so that the COIO or ICOI Committee can review the proposed transaction and the related disclosure(s) and manage, if necessary, any identified ICOI in accordance with this policy prior to finalization of the proposed transaction.\nThe University recognizes that some transactions will be finalized prior to a review and determination by the COIO or ICOI Committee. \u00a0In these instances, the Institutional Financial Interests will still be reviewed by the COIO or the ICOI Committee and any identified ICOI\u2019s will be managed in accordance with this policy so as to allow the transaction or relationship to continue uninterrupted while also appropriately mitigating or managing any potential ICOI concerns. \u00a0\n2. Review of Institutional Financial Interests of University Officials:\nThe COIO shall also collect and review all disclosures made by University Officials. \u00a0If a University Official discloses an Institutional Financial Interest that is related to that Official\u2019s University role and responsibilities, then the COIO shall assign the Disclosure for review by the ICOI Committee as outlined below.\n3. ICOI Determination:\nThe ICOI Committee or the COIO, under authority granted by the ICOI Committee, shall determine whether the Institutional Financial Interest could inappropriately affect or reasonably appear to inappropriately affect University Activities. In making the ICOI determination, the ICOI Committee or the COIO shall consider whether the Institutional Financial Interests disclosed as outlined above have the potential to, or appear to, affect any of the following:\nSafety of human research subjects;\nIntegrity of research;\nAppropriate allocation of resources;\nObjectivity and independence of educational activities;\nIndependence of professional practice judgment; and\nObjectivity in business and contracting decisions.\nIf the ICOI Committee or COIO shall find that an ICOI exists, then it shall also determine whether the ICOI shall be managed or eliminated.\nTo ensure efficiency, the ICOI Committee is authorized to delegate to the COIO its authority to determine whether an Institutional Financial Interest constitutes an ICOI, and in the event the ICOI Committee has delegated that authority to the COIO through specific guidelines set forth in a Standard Operating Procedure, the COIO may determine whether the Institutional Financial Interest constitutes an ICOI without referral to the Committee.\n\tD.\u00a0 ICOI Management\n\tThe ICOI Committee or COIO shall document its ICOI determination and, if applicable, a management plan, which shall specify the actions that have been, and\/or shall be, taken to manage the ICOI.\u00a0 Examples of conditions and restrictions that may be imposed to manage an ICOI, either as a single condition or restriction, or as a combination of conditions and restrictions, and on either an interim or permanent basis include, but are not limited to:\nPublic disclosure of the ICOI (e.g., in public presentations or publications of the related research);\nDisclosure of the ICOI to human participants, if applicable;\nAppointment of an independent monitor capable and willing to take appropriate measures to protect the design, conduct and reporting of the Research against potential bias resulting from the ICOI;\nWhere the ICOI involves a University Official, formal recusal of the conflicted official from the chain of authority over the related project and possibly also from authority over salary, promotion, and space allocation decisions affecting the investigator or staff, as well as communication of the recusal arrangements to the Official\u2019s superior and colleagues;\nWhere the ICOI involves a University Official, designation of a \u201csafe haven\u201d (e.g., a non-conflicted senior individual) with whom the investigator or staff can address ICOI-related concerns;\nReduction or elimination of the Institutional Financial Interest (e.g., sale of an equity interest); or\nSeverance of the relationship giving rise to the ICOI.\nThe COIO shall communicate to the IRB summary information about the nature and amount of any Institutional Financial Interest related to human participants in research, along with the ICOI Committee's findings, ICOI determination and any institutional management plan approved by the ICOI Committee.\n\tThe COIO shall also, as deemed necessary, communicate summary information about the nature and amount of the Institutional Financial Interest, along with the ICOI Committee's findings, ICOI determination and any institutional management plan approved by the ICOI Committee to appropriate University offices.\nNON-COMPLIANCE \/ FAILURE TO DISCLOSE:\nNon-compliance with this policy, and any disciplinary action resulting due to non-compliance with this policy, will be managed in accordance with applicable University policies and processes as determined by the status of the individual involved in the non-compliance.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may have specific application and should be referred to, especially:\n AD47 - General Standards of Professional Ethics;\nFN14 - Use of Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services;\nHR35 - Public Service by Members of the Faculty and Staff;\nHR80 - Private Consulting Practice;\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest;\nRP02 - Addressing Allegations of Research Misconduct (Formerly RA10, Handling Inquiries\/Investigations Into Questions of Ethics in Research and in Other Scholarly Activities);\nIP06\u00a0- Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurial Activity (Faculty Research);\nRP06 - Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests (formerly RA20, Individual Conflict of Interest)\u00a0\nMost recent changes:\nJune 8, 2018 -\u00a0Added Chief Executive Officer of Ben Franklin Technology Partners for Northern and Central Pennsylvania to list of University Officials.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\n\nJanuary 3, 2018 - Editorial change to remove Director of the Electro-Optics Center from list of University Officials.\n\nJuly 17, 2017 - Changes have been made throughout the entire policy to better clarify the handling of conflict of interest.\nJune 9, 2015 - Editorial changes in the DEFINITIONS (Conflict of Interest Official -\"COIO\"), IMPLEMENTATION and CROSS REFERENCES sections to reflect policy renumbering from the migration of RA10 and RA20 to the Research Protections Policies RP02 and RP06, respectively.\nApril 3, 2015 - Editorial changes;

Although distinct in purpose or restriction, individual endowments are commingled and invested together in Penn State\u2019s Long-Term Investment Pool (LTIP).\nTrue Endowment: Endowments created with funds received from an outside donor, which will be held in perpetuity with income used for designated purposes.\nQuasi-Endowment (Funds Functioning as an Endowment): Internally funded endowments, which are funded through unrestricted miscellaneous funds (general funds may not be used for this purpose). The decision to hold the funds in perpetuity is made by the University, not an outside donor.\nTerm Endowment: Term endowments are created with funds from external sources, which generally fund a specific event. An end-date is established in the guidelines, and the principal is spent down over the life of the term endowment. Use of term endowments is not encouraged.\nNamed Annually Funded Account (NAFA): Gifts are made annually to the NAFA, which only has a spending account, and spent annually in accordance with the guidelines. To establish NAFA guidelines, the donor must pledge, for a period of at least 5 years, a dollar amount equal to at least 5% of the minimum required to endow the same type of account. This option is available for some but not all of the purposes identified for endowments.\nGuideline: An official University document that describes the benefactor\u2019s intent and specifies how the subject endowment or annual income will be used. All guidelines are drafted and approved by the Office of Gift Planning.\nStatement of Intent: A University document that reflects the benefactor\u2019s current wishes for the administration of the future endowment and locks in the current minimum for that specific type of endowment. All Statements of Intent are drafted and approved by the Office of Gift Planning.\nScholarship: An award of money to a student, granted in recognition of academic distinction and\/or to provide financial assistance.\nGraduate Fellowship: An award of money to a graduate student, including payment of or reimbursement for expenditures related to dissertation or thesis completion, granted in recognition of academic distinction and\/or to provide financial assistance.\nAward: Recognition for achievement of a single specific nature. It may be for grades, for activities, or a combination of both grades and activities. Awards may be created to benefit students, faculty, or staff.\nChair: Provides supplemental department support for outstanding University faculty in order to provide a holder of the chair with the resources necessary to continue and further the scholar's contributions to teaching, research, and public service. The holder shall be a full-time member of the University faculty with the academic rank of professor, senior scientist, or librarian.\nProfessorship: Provides distinguished scholars the opportunity to continue and further the scholar's contributions to teaching, research, and public service through the provision of salary and supplementary funds. The holder must be a full-time member of the University faculty, or a visiting faculty member, with the academic rank of professor, senior scientist, or librarian.\nCareer Development or Early Career Professorship: Provides supplemental department support for outstanding University faculty in order to provide a holder of the career development professorship with critical financial support and encouragement for faculty starting an academic career. The holder must be a full-time or visiting faculty member with the academic rank of assistant professor or higher, and the term of the appointment shall be awarded on a rotating basis for a three-year period.\nLectureship: Lectures enable Penn State students and faculty to interact and develop relationships with important leaders and professionals in a variety of fields. Lecture series often provide the stimulus for innovations in research and education.\nProgram Support\/General Endowment: Enhance the academic environment of our students and faculty, often merging the special interests of a donor with enrichment opportunities.\nPROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTS:\nAll proposals to Persons or organizations contemplating the establishment of endowed or named annually funded accounts must be cleared by the Associate Vice President of Development through the Prospect Management and Solicitation System before submission to the potential donor. Prior to being submitted to the Associate Vice President for approval, all proposals must be cleared by the appropriate administrative officer (dean or chancellor). All draft guidelines must be prepared by the Office of Gift Planning who will obtain all other necessary University approvals. A Lotus Notes application has been developed for this purpose.\nWhile the emphasis should be on encouraging unrestricted gifts to the institution, donors may restrict the purpose for which an outright gift (via Endowment or NAFA Guidelines) will be used or how a planned gift will eventually be used (via Statement of Intent) by the University. The University prefers that any restrictions be agreed to at the time the gift is established, but in any case, such restrictions should be fully documented in writing in the guideline. The University reserves the right in any guideline, statement of intent, or gift agreement to broaden the purpose of a gift should it be determined by the Board of Trustees at some future date that the purpose for the gift no longer best serves the mission of the University.\nFunding Options\nBelow are the different basic funding options and issues related to establishing endowments and named annually funded accounts. As noted in the  Minimum Requirements section, not every funding option is available for every account purpose.\nOutright gift: A benefactor\u2019s gift satisfies the specific endowment minimum requirement at the time that the endowment is established.\n\nAn endowment guideline and account are created.\nAll endowment purposes may be funded in this manner.\n\nPledge Commitment: A benefactor may sign an irrevocable pledge commitment to satisfy the specific endowment minimum requirement during a period of no more than 5 years from the time that the endowment is established.\n\nAn endowment guideline and account are created.\nAll endowment purposes may be funded in this manner.\n\nEarly activation of a Pledge Commitment: A benefactor may also pledge to early activate their pledged endowment by providing annual gifts, for a period of at least five years, to the spending account of at least 5% of the minimum endowment level.\n\nAll endowment purposes may be early activated in this manner.\n\nFuture funding: A benefactor may choose to create an endowment in the future with some type of deferred gift (i.e., gift annuity, charitable remainder trust, bequest) and may choose to formalize this future gift by creating a Statement of Intent (SOI). If a gift annuity is used to fund a future endowment, the amount must be two (2) times the minimum funding level required at the time the gift annuity is established.\n\nNO endowment guideline or account is created.\nNOT all endowment purposes may be funded in this manner; specifics are provided in the minimum requirements section.\n\nEXCEPTION: Early Activation of future funding: A benefactor may choose to early activate a pledged future endowment during their lifetime by providing annual gifts, for a period of at least five years, to the spending account of at least 5% of the minimum endowment level. In this case, the Statement of Intent would be converted to a guideline.\n\nAn endowment guideline and account are created.\nNOT all endowment purposes may be funded in this manner; specifics are provided in the minimum requirements section.\n\nNamed annually funded account: NAFAs may be established for a fixed period of time by an annual expendable gift of not less than five percent (5%) of the minimum required endowment level. The benefactor must make such a commitment for a minimum of five years and sign a pledge commitment form.\n\nNAFA guideline and non-endowed account are created.\nNOT all endowment purposes may be funded in this manner; specifics are provided in the minimum requirements section.\n\n\nAccepting Corporate Matching Gifts for Endowments\nDonors are permitted to make a personal commitment toward an endowment with the knowledge that they are intending to use any matching gift support that might be forthcoming from their company; however, donors would not be obligating the company to this commitment. Donors will be given up to five years to make their personal gifts and to secure any applicable matching gifts from their employer. All matching gifts will be allocated to the same purpose as the initial gift unless the University is directed to do otherwise. At the end of the five year period, one of three things will occur:\n1) The endowment has met the minimum required, and the endowment is then activated;\n2) The endowment has not met the minimum, and donors are given 180 days to either make-up the difference personally, or to secure the necessary matching support that may be forthcoming as a result of their previous philanthropy; or\n3) The endowment fund is terminated and collapsed into the unit\u2019s general scholarship fund or other designated purpose (an existing fund that was predetermined in the original guidelines that the donor signed at the time of making his or her pledge). Any questions concerning Corporate Matching for Endowments should be directed to the Office of Gift Planning.\nUse of matching gift funds toward satisfaction of the endowment minimum must be determined prior to initiating guidelines and a pledge commitment form. Approved language will be included in both documents to allow for a complete transfer of funds if the minimum endowment level is not reached within the allocated time period. The Office of Gift Planning will prepare the guidelines and pledge commitment form.\n\nVolunteer Group Endowments\nVolunteer groups who are interested in creating named endowments at Penn State may be allowed, upon approval of the Associate Vice President for Development, to create a term endowment with the option of converting that term endowment to a traditional endowment if the required minimum endowment principal is attained. This term endowment may only be used to establish an award, a program fund, or a scholarship, and it will not be permitted for the establishment of a Trustee Matching Scholarship due to the unique benefits and the management of that program. The process is as follows:\n\nUpon approval, guidelines will be drafted by the Office of Gift Planning. Guidelines will include approved language to allow for the term endowment.\nAll contributions are deposited into a term endowment principal account, and the endowment is designated as inactive, allowing income to revert to principal until the required endowment minimum is attained.\nThe volunteer group has a maximum of five fiscal years from the date that the guideline is signed to reach the required endowment minimum.\nIf the endowment principal book value reaches the minimum required during the five-year period, the account is converted to a traditional endowment and is activated.\nIf the principal book value does not meet the required minimum during the five-year period, the term endowment is activated. In the case of a scholarship endowment, for example, the active term endowment would transfer $2,500 from the principal account to the spending account each year, which is combined for expenditure with the annual endowment spending allocation. The endowment operates in this manner until one of the following occurs: a.) All monies are expended and the term endowment ceases to exist. b.) Additional gifts increase the endowment book value to the required minimum and the volunteer group requests conversion to a traditional endowment.\nThe volunteer group may choose to early-activate their term endowment in order to provide immediate funds for scholarship awards. All gifts would continue to be directed to a term endowment principal account until satisfying the required endowment minimum. However, the endowment would begin to operate as a term endowment immediately as described above. The original conditions concerning reaching the endowment minimum in conversion to a traditional endowment also apply to the early activated term endowments.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOUNTS:\nThe University has established certain requirements for each type of endowment. The endowment types, the minimum gift required, the payment terms of the gift, the purposes for which the endowment will be established and the monies used are as follows:\nDean\u2019s\/Chancellor\u2019s Chair\nMinimum Endowment: $5,000,000, payable over no more than 5 years\nEligible Funding Options:\nOutright gift\nPledge Commitment, payable over not more than 5 years\nPurpose: Provide unrestricted support to the academic college or campus led by the Dean\/Chancellor.

Proposals for the early activation of a future endowed chair, professorship, or named career development professorship will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. The following general guidelines apply: The agreement reached with the donor to fund the future endowment must be of an irrevocable nature -- charitable remainder trust, charitable gift annuity, estate note, etc. If a gift annuity is used to fund a future endowment, the amount must be two (2) times the minimum funding level required at the time the gift annuity is established.\nIn cases where approval has been received, the donor must commit to a minimum five-year pledge of at least five percent (5%) of the minimum required endowment per year until the endowment principal becomes available. A term of at least five years is required.\nThe faculty position exists as long as it is early activated. At the point where the donor cannot or will not fund a five (5) year commitment, the College has the option to fund the position, or the position will be suspended.\nEarly activation of an endowed chair, professorship, or named career development professorship through annual gifts will require that all parties be informed that funding of the position will continue as long as resources are available.\n\nLectureship\nMinimum endowment: $100,000\nEligible Funding Options:\nOutright gift\nPledge Commitment, payable over not more than 5 years\nFuture funding\nEarly activation of future funding\nNamed annually funded account\nPurpose: Lectures enable Penn State students and faculty to interact and develop relationships with important leaders and professionals in a variety of fields.

In consideration of a donor\u2019s willingness to support a DGF, the University will match annually a portion of the graduate student\u2019s fellowship. Matching funds commence when the DGF is fully funded. If the gift is early activated, the match from the Graduate School is activated as well.\nThe DGF offering will end either June 30, 2014 or when matching DGF funds are depleted, whichever occurs first.\n\nAward\nMinimum endowment: $20,000\nEligible Funding Options:\nOutright gift\nPledge Commitment, payable over not more than 5 years\nFuture funding\nEarly activation of future funding\nNamed annually funded account\nPurpose: Provide recognition for achievement of a single specific nature.

The distance a mother needs to travel to get to a private breastfeeding\/pumping location also needs to be considered.\nBreastfeeding mothers will be allowed a reasonable amount of break time to breastfeed and\/or express milk during work hours which, if possible, shall run concurrently with normal break and meal periods. Time allowed in excess of the normal break and meal periods will be covered preferably by a flexible work arrangement. Breastfeeding mothers should work with their supervisors to establish mutually convenient times.\nThe mother may request a flexible work schedule that provides a longer lunch break to allow the mother time to travel to and breastfeed the child. Such arrangements are encouraged as long as the University's work needs can be efficiently and effectively met.\nSome examples of these flexible accommodations might include:\nShorten a lunch break to account for a morning and an afternoon lactation break.\nArrive at work earlier than the regular starting time or leave later than the regular departure time to account for lactation breaks.\nComplete a project at home to account for lactation breaks.\nFACILITIES:\nA woman may breastfeed her child in any place, public or private, where the mother and child are otherwise authorized to be present. If the mother desires a private space to breastfeed and\/or express milk and does not work in a private office, then a private, secure, and sanitary area, other than a restroom, will be made available. The space will have an electrical outlet and will be in reasonable proximity to the work area. To the extent reasonably possible, the department will make sure that a refrigerator is available.\nThe Breastfeeding Support Program at Penn State sponsors several lactation stations on the University Park campus and several other Commonwealth Campuses (current list of lactation stations). These rooms are available to faculty, staff, and students. Additional lactation stations may be established by colleges, campuses, and administrative areas by contacting the Breastfeeding Support Program.\nNOTIFICATION AND REQUEST PROCESS:\nMothers are responsible for requesting lactation support prior to or during maternity leave, preferably no later than four weeks before returning to work, by completing a Breastfeeding Support Accommodation Request form located at the end of this policy and submitting it to her supervisor and human resources representative.In addition, the mother must notify her supervisor when she discontinues breastfeeding or expressing milk.\nUpon receiving the Breastfeeding Support Accommodation Request form, the supervisor and human resources representative will identify the appropriate space, ensure that the mother is aware of her right to a reasonable amount of break time and a private location to breastfeed and\/or express milk, and discuss any flexible work arrangements that may be necessary. In addition, the supervisor will be responsible for creating an environment that is supportive to the breastfeeding mother.\nWhile children are welcome on campus to breastfeed, it is expected that the child will not remain in the office, classroom, or other space not officially designated as a child care center after the breastfeeding break.\nQuestions, concerns, and requests for technical support should be referred to the Breastfeeding Support Program (814-867-0776), breastfeeding@psu.edu).\nBreastfeeding Accommodation Request Form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"Penn State is committed to establishing and maintaining a healthful and safe environment for our faculty, staff, and students, in part by creating a culture which is supportive of wellness efforts across all life events. One life event for many women is pregnancy and childbirth. Breastfeeding lays a foundation for life-long health and wellness for both the mother and child, the benefits of which extend to Penn State with reduced absenteeism and reduced healthcare costs. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has identified breastfeeding as a public health priority, especially for its potential to reduce rates of obesity, Type II diabetes, certain cancers, and infectious diseases. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for at least one year; while the World Health Organization recommends a minimum of two years.

Works of authorship include the following categories: literary works; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works. These categories include dictionaries, directories, computer programs and databases. Copyright protection does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries, although these may be protectable under patent and trade secret laws.\nPOLICY ON COURSE MATERIALS:\nAn original work of authorship prepared by a faculty member is subject to copyright protection. The \"original hard copy\" material in printed or tangible form includes but is not limited to) handouts, diagrams, photographs, motion pictures, and computer programs, databases and audio and video recordings.\nThe Copyright Act prohibits the unauthorized reproduction and\/or sale of \"original hard copy\" works of authorship prepared by a faculty member, and presented, offered or distributed during a class lecture.\nA faculty member's oral lecture presentation generally is ephemeral, and therefore not subject to copyright protection because it is not fixed in any tangible medium of expression from which it can be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. However, a faculty member has a privacy interest in the unauthorized recording of his\/her oral lecture presentation, and the faculty member may prohibit the unauthorized recording of oral lecture presentations.\nPOLICY ON RECORDING OF CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES:\nStudent-initiated, faculty-initiated, and University-directed recordings can include traditional audio and video recordings of classroom lectures, activities, and course material as well as new communications technologies that provide for streaming and digital transmissions or recording of such instructional content or communications between faculty members and students or students engaged in class activities.\u00a0 With the exception of recordings strictly for individual use (i.e., they will be viewed and\/or heard only by the individual making the recording), if the recordings include student activities, the person responsible for recording should inform in advance anyone whose activity is being recorded and explain the likely use of the recording.\u00a0 Any subsequent usage of recordings must be in compliance with privacy policies discussed below.\nStudent Initiated Recording\nA student must not record activity in classrooms or other instructional settings without the express permission of the faculty member responsible for instruction in the course.\u00a0 Authorized student-initiated recordings must be used only for the education of the students enrolled in the initiating student\u2019s class during the period in which the student is enrolled in the class. In addition to the requirements in the preceding paragraph, an authorized student-initiated recording must not be made available to anyone outside of the students enrolled in the class in any fashion, including posting online or through other media without the express written consent of the faculty member responsible for the course or the cognizant University administrator.\nFaculty Initiated Recording\nWhen a faculty member responsible for a course initiates the recording of lectures or other classroom activities in that course and when such recording does not require University resources in excess of what would normally be allocated in similar instructional settings, the faculty member shall have copyright ownership rights to and plenary control over the subsequent use of the recordings subject to the University\u2019s license and the privacy protections noted below.\u00a0 Although the University does not assert ownership of such recordings, it shall have a non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use and retain copies of such recordings for instructional purposes.\nUniversity-Directed Recording\nDirected recordings are those created at the specific direction of a University unit for the University\u2019s ownership and use. A recording will be deemed a University-directed work if it is created pursuant to a written agreement between the faculty member or staff member and the University unit or pursuant to the standing policy of the unit in which the class is taught. Employees in staff positions should clarify with their supervisors as to whether a particular project should be considered directed work as part of the employees normal duties. A recording will be considered a University-directed work regardless of whether it is made by a University employee or by an external entity at the University\u2019s request.\nUse of Recordings\nAll decisions regarding current and subsequent use of recordings should further the University's paramount purpose of advancing and sharing knowledge. University-directed recordings or faculty-initiated recordings may be archived by the University and made accessible to the University community for internal use. Before any recordings are used in subsequent Penn State classes or made otherwise available, the recorded faculty member should be consulted if possible to ensure academic quality and to verify the currency of the recorded content. Any commercialization or external use of University-directed recordings shall occur only by written permission of the faculty member whose course was recorded.\u00a0 The contribution of the recorded faculty members shall be appropriately acknowledged in any future use of recordings if he or she indicates a desire for such attribution.\nPRIVACY POLICY:\nFaculty and students engaged in the instructional process have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Assurance of privacy encourages open and robust discussions on issues and ideas without fear that any statements made will be used for inappropriate purposes and, thereby, enhances learning. Implementation of this policy shall be in keeping with AD53-Privacy Statement, that recognizes the University's obligation not to infringe upon the reasonable privacy expectations of faculty, staff and students in classrooms and other instructional settings, subject only to applicable state and federal laws and University regulations.\nStudent-initiated, faculty-initiated, and University-directed recordings of student activity online, in classrooms, or in other instructional settings may be used by the faculty member and registered students for only internal class purposes and by only the students during the period in which the course is being offered. Recordings in which student activity is included may be subsequently performed, displayed, or made available online or otherwise only with the informed consent of the students involved or if all student activity is excised. A faculty-initiated recording that includes student activity may be retained by the faculty member only for his or her individual use.\nNOTE-TAKING AND COMMERCIAL NOTE-TAKING SERVICES:\nA registered student lawfully may take original hand written or typed notes during an oral lecture presentation and may sell those notes in the free marketplace. The notes may be subject to copyright protection, provided the notes represent an original work of authorship, but any such copyright would not impact in any manner on the faculty member's ownership of the subject matter presented orally, nor the hard copy materials presented and\/or distributed during the lecture.\nAudio or video recordings of classroom activity by students for the purposes of note-taking are subject to the rules governing student-initiated recordings in this policy.\nThe following statements have been developed from an interpretation of the federal Copyright Act and University policy, to serve as a guide to faculty rights on note-taking issues:\nAny reproduction of the \"fixed and tangible form\" of a faculty member's original work(s) of authorship is prohibited by the Copyright Act, and would be subject to a copyright infringement action brought by the faculty member, as copyright owner; or by the University, as copyright owner, in the case of works for hire.\nNotes taken during an oral lecture presentation should be an interpretation of, and not a verbatim transcript of the lecture material. Such notes generally are construed to be original. Students have no copyright ownership of verbatim transcripts or substantially verbatim notes.\nIf notes taken during an oral lecture presentation can be shown to be original, they may be copyrighted by the note-taker\/note-taking service and sold to third parties, but this copyright does not transcend the ownership rights of the faculty member to the original lecture material, nor the future uses of that subject material.\nOnly formally registered students may attend class and qualify as a note-taker. The policy basis of excluding non-registered students, or non-students, from attending class is two-fold:\nSuch individuals have not contracted for the educational services provided in the class, and\nUniversity Policy AD27 prohibits the use of University facilities and\/or property for commercial sales activities by individuals or non-University organizations.\n\nNothing contained in this policy is intended to restrict a faculty member's right to conduct a class as he\/she deems most appropriate, such as electing to distribute class notes in order to promote class interaction, the use of taped lectures, etc.\nEXCEPTIONS:\nThe following is a permissible exception to this policy:\nAny accommodations required by Federal or State law for disabled students. Contact the Office of Disability Services for current legal requirements and details on the services provided for disabled students.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Dean and Vice President for Undergraduate Education and\/or the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD27 - Commercial Sales Activities at University Locations,\nAD53 - Privacy Statement,\nAD77 - Engaging in Outside Professional Activities (Conflict of Commitment),\nIP01 - Ownership and Management of Intellectual Property (Formerly RA11 - Patents and Copyrights [Intellectual Property]), and\nIP05 - Policy Governing Copyright Clearance (Formerly AD46).\nEffective Date: May 20, 2013\n\tDate Approved: May 20, 2013\n\tDate Published: May 20, 2013 (Editorial changes, February 23, 2015)\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 23, 2015 - Editorial changes.

The application for, and the use of, any other credit card that places the University in financial liability is prohibited.\nNOTE: Issuance of a Purchasing Card to an individual grants that cardholder the authority to make purchases using the Purchasing Card for valid and reasonable University business purposes. Individuals who make purchases on personal credit cards or use other personal funds, do so outside the authority granted by the purchase card agreement and are not assured of reimbursement. The Financial Officer shall determine on a case by case basis, on consultation with the budget administrator, if purchases made by an individual from personal funds are valid, reasonable and reimbursable. A purchase may be valid and reasonable and NOT reimbursable.\nThe Penn State Purchasing Card may only be used to acquire goods, materials, authorized services and\/or travel-related expenditures, including group meeting and meal expenses, necessary for the ongoing operation of the University. Purchases for personal use are strictly prohibited.\nExcept for classes of items listed under Specific Restrictions below, goods, materials, authorized services and\/or travel-related expenditures up to the cardholder's limit per transaction (including delivery, shipping, or special handling charges) may be charged on the Penn State Purchasing Card. The maximum transaction limits are set forth in procedure PC2009, Penn State Purchasing Card, but may be set lower for any cardholder.\nPurchases made with the Purchasing Card are specifically restricted by the conditions spelled out in the agreement signed by the employee approved to hold the Purchasing Card, and do not require prior Department of Purchasing Services' approval for each transaction. Purchasing Cards are not to be used to circumvent General Stores or standard purchasing procedures. Multiple Purchasing Card purchases are not to be used to circumvent the regular Purchasing Card limits.\nGOODS & SERVICES: The authorized individuals to whom cards are issued for goods & services transactions are responsible for receiving the material and services, and forwarding purchase documentation evidencing the transaction to the reconciler (designated by the Financial Officer). The reconcilers are responsible for assuring that suitable documentation of the transaction has been obtained and are responsible for reconciling the documentation against the transaction data provided to the University from the card-issuing bank. Additional obligations for cardholders and reconcilers appear in Purchasing Card Procedure PC2009, and on agreements exhibited in that procedure.\nTRAVEL & GROUP MEALS\/MEETINGS: The authorized individuals to whom cards are issued for travel & group meals\/meetings are responsible for settling the charges in the Employee Reimbursement System (ERS) or an authorized delegate may settle the charges. The travel settlement in ERS will follow an appropriate approval path, including the budget administrator and Financial Officer to assure compliance with policy and procedure. If amounts are due to the cardholder, a direct deposit will be made to the cardholder's bank account. If a net amount is due for all travel settled in ERS, the net amount will be deducted from the cardholder's paycheck at the end of the month.\nThe Penn State Purchasing Cards remain the property of the University and can be recalled at any time. If the employee to whom it is issued leaves the University or is transferred within the University, the card must be cancelled, and the plastic card cut in half or otherwise destroyed - it may not be transferred or reissued. Refer to \"Return of Cards\" section in procedure PC2009, available in GURU.\nSPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS OF GOODS AND SERVICES:\nThe Purchasing Card has specific restrictions on the types of goods and services which may be purchased.\u00a0\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nMULTIPLE OR SPLIT TRANSACTIONS:\nTransactions on the Purchasing card may not be split into multiple transactions, or deferred into several billings, to circumvent purchasing card limits or year-end purchasing procedures. Likewise, it is not permissible to use several purchasing cards within a department to make a purchase that in total exceeds the University maximum transaction limit for the purchasing card.\n FOOD \/ MEETING EXPENSES:\nPer FN10, itemized receipts are required for all group meals\/meetings. All group meals, whether conducted during travel or while on campus, must be entered into ERS. The information required to support the group meal (location, attendees, business purpose) must be entered into ERS for review and approval by the budget administrator and financial officer. The same holds true for group meeting expenditures.\nTRAVEL:\nTravel may be charged to a Purchasing Card if the cardholder has signed the Purchasing Card agreement for travel. Cardholders with Travels & Group Meal\/Meeting card spending limits should be familiar with the\u00a0University Travel Policy.\nCELLULAR SERVICES:\nCellular monthly charges for University-owned cellular devices, as allowable under Policy FN21, are permitted. See Policy FN21 for specific details.\nDEFERRED PURCHASES:\nPurchasing cards may not be used to make deferred or installment payments, except for monthly subscription services, such as Internet research services or telecommunications services (see Cellular Services above). For these services that are billed monthly, a recurring automated payment may be allowable so long as business need is periodically reviewed and receipts or invoices are received on a monthly basis from the vendor.\nPREPAID PURCHASES:\nPurchasing Cards may not be used to purchase a card, certificate, token, or any other item having a monetary value which may be redeemed for cash, credit or merchandise for the purpose of circumventing University purchasing and purchasing card policies or deferring expenses. In addition, Purchasing Cards may not be used to load value on other cards such as the Penn State id+ Card. However, gift\/merchandise cards and certificates are allowable only to the extent specified by the \"Gift\" provision of policy FN18. The use of gift\/merchandise cards and certificates should be reviewed and approved by the Financial Officer prior to purchase. Per FN10, gifts for employees are not permissible from any University funds.\nREBATES AND INCENTIVES\nWith the exception of frequent flier mileage and preferred hotel programs, rebates or purchase incentives that are obtained as a result of a purchase made with the Purchasing Card belong to the University. This also includes any tangible, non-cash items offered and received. Non-cash items with a value of $25 or more must be reported to the Financial Officer so proper recording (receipt and disposition) of the item can be made. Rebates should be credited to the account to which the original transaction that generated the rebate was charged. Cash items must be credited to an appropriate University account per the Financial Officer's direction. Purchase incentives, coupons or certificates for discounts on future purchases must be turned into the department for future use by the University.\nSELECTION OF VENDOR:\nThe department or individual authorized may select the vendor who can best supply the item(s)\/services required. Cardholders are strongly encouraged to use internal sources and contract vendors. The Department of Purchasing Services maintains a list of vendors under contract to supply the University at discounted rates. Visit the Travel Services website for information on \"designated travel sources\" for various travel services. Cardholders are also strongly encouraged to use small, women owned and minority vendors whenever their prices are competitive.\nOBTAINING A UNIVERSITY PURCHASING CARD:\nEmployees who wish to apply for a Purchasing Card must first successfully complete the Purchasing Card on-Line Tutorial and Cardholder Certification Quiz and electronically agree to the Purchasing Card Cardholder Agreement  during the certification process.\nApproval for obtaining a University Purchasing Card is then processed on an IBIS form Add Purchasing Card Authorization \"APCA.\" The budget administrator or budget executive and Financial Officer for the unit must approve the form, including the appropriate purchase transaction types and spending limits, before a purchasing card will be issued. Approvers have the authority to set lower limits than the University maximums for any card.\n CARD ELIGIBILITY:\nOnly current active employees are eligible for a purchasing card and only upon approval of the appropriate department. When an employee retires or terminates, the purchasing card must be cancelled through the UPCA form. Cards may also be cancelled at the discretion of the unit which issued the card to the employee.\nEmeritus and retired faculty\/staff may be eligible to retain a purchasing card for goods and services transactions, but this must be formally approved by the unit Budget Executive based on a documented business need. The Financial Officer will be responsible for obtaining and retaining documented approval. Emeritus and retired faculty may not retain travel limits on purchasing cards, even if retention of the purchasing card is approved for goods and services.\nMAINTENANCE OF RECORDS:\nGOODS & SERVICES:\nDocumentation that confirms the goods, materials or authorized services were ordered and received, and the amount of the transaction must be obtained by the card holder. (Refer to Procedure PC2009 for a description of what constitutes acceptable documentation).\nFor Purchasing Card acquisitions, the card holder is responsible for the following:\nverifying that the receipts and support form pertaining to ordered material or services accurately depicts the transaction including the amounts paid,\nmarking on the support form the authorized accounts to which the transaction should be charged ,\nensuring the support form contains the description of the purchased item or services (what was purchased),\nnoting the purpose of the acquisition on the support form (why it was purchased- business purpose),\nsigning the receipt when not already signed to indicate that goods and services were received, and\nsigning the support form as verification that the information on the support form is correct.\nThe original purchase documentation is always to be given to the departmental reconciler for additional processing. The purchasing card transaction 'P-number' is to be noted on any other settlement forms. The purchase documentation must be maintained by the department or in the Financial Officer's area (at the discretion of the Financial Officer). Documentation for transactions posted to federal or federal flow-through accounts must be retained for 7 years after the termination date of the award. For all other transactions, the retention is the current fiscal year + 3 years.\nTRAVEL & GROUP MEALS\/MEETINGS:\nRefer to the University Travel Policy for specific instructions involving travel.\nRETURN OF DAMAGED GOODS:\nArrangements for Purchasing Card purchases that must be returned to the vendor are the responsibility of the cardholder. Additional follow up by the cardholder is required to verify that the vendor issues credit documentation and that it is properly processed through VISA. Merchandise may not be returned for a cash refund.\nCOMPROMISED CARDS:\nA Purchasing Card is considered compromised if it is lost or stolen, or if an unauthorized transaction(s) by an unknown third party is processed against the card. All compromised cards must be dealt with as described in Procedure PC2009.\nCARDHOLDER MISUSE:\nAdditional cardholder obligations appear in Procedure PC2009, and on the Designated User Form(Purchasing Card Cardholder Agreement) exhibited in that procedure.\nMisuse of the purchasing card by the cardholder or others who they have authorized to use their card will result in disciplinary action, which is detailed in Procedure PC2009. Misuse is broadly defined as using the card in violation of University policy and procedure. The following are examples of misuse of the purchasing card:\nUsing the purchasing card for personal purchases or for purchases that would not be authorized by the University,\nUsing the purchasing card to purchase any goods or services which violate policies or procedures of the University, including those items listed in this policy as specific restrictions for the purchasing card, or which violate any law or regulation to which the University must adhere,\nSplitting a transaction to circumvent the transaction limit authorized for the cardholder's card,\nUsing multiple cards to circumvent the transaction limit authorized for the cardholder's card,\nFailing to provide required purchasing documentation in a timely manner ( unless there are extenuating circumstances, within 30 days of purchase for goods & services or within 60 days for travel & group meals\/meetings; 30 days if charges are on restricted funds and is completed in the last month of the sponsored agreement ),\nFailing to provide, when requested, information about any specific purchase.\nMisuse of the purchasing card by the cardholder or those authorized by the cardholder to make purchases on their card, can result in sanctions being placed on a cardholder. These are listed in Procedure PC2009, and can range from suspension or cancellation of the card to more severe disciplinary action such as termination.\nBy signing the cardholder agreement, the cardholder gives the University permission to withhold from University pay an appropriate amount including processing fees to cover any unsubstantiated charges or other misuse of the purchasing card. The decision to assess a cardholder's paycheck would only be acted upon after complete multiple review of the situation by the financial officer, consultation with the budget administrator\/department head and budget executive and additional review by the Corporate Controller's Office. A description of the sanctions and the process leading to the withholding of pay is described in Procedure PC2009 and on the Designated User Form (Purchasing Card Cardholder Agreement).\nEXCEPTIONS:\nThe Assistant Controller\/Financial Officers together with the Purchasing Card Coordinator must approve in writing any exceptions to this policy and to Procedure PC2009.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\n CROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may apply, especially:\nBS16 - Limited Order\nFN10 - Other Business Expenses and Activities\nFN11 - Contracts and Leases\nFN14 - Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services\nFN16 - Interdepartmental Transactions\nFN21 - Cellular Services (Formerly Non-Office Telecommunications Services)\nUniversity Travel Policy\nEffective Date: March 10, 2016\n\tApproval Date: March 10, 2016\n\tDate Published: March 10, 2016 (Editorial change, June 14, 2017)\n\u00a0\nMost Recent Changes:\nJune 14, 2017- Editorial change in the SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS section (Travel), removing the reference to \"travel booked through designated travel sources\u201dper the directive of the Purchasing Card Director, as there are no longer \u201cdesignated travel sources\u201d for Purchasing Cards.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMarch 10, 2016- A new section entitled CARD ELIGIBILITY has been added to clarify eligibility criteria and required approvals.

The support monies will be used for such purposes as salary supplementation, graduate assistant stipends, secretarial assistance, and travel expenses, etc. By supporting the establishment of a University-named professorship, the benefactor directs attention to a continuing commitment to support scholarship within the University.\nQUALIFICATIONS AND LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT:\nThe holder of a University-named professorship must be a full-time member of the University faculty, or a visiting faculty member, with the academic rank of professor, senior scientist, or librarian. The term of the appointment shall be determined by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University upon recommendation of the dean of the appropriate college, consistent with the conditions of the grant.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR APPOINTMENT:\nAppointments will be made by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University upon recommendation of the dean of the appropriate college.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS:\nFunds for a University-named professorship are provided by gifts or designated University funds appropriate for this purpose. To establish such a position, an endowment of not less than $1,000,000 is required and the income therefrom, to the extent necessary, shall be used to maintain the professorship in perpetuity. Alternatively, a University professorship may be established for a fixed period of time by an expendable grant of not less than 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year for a minimum of 5 years.\nEARLY ACTIVATION:\nIn certain cases, the agreement reached with a major donor regarding the support of a University-named professorship may specify that the University will not receive the endowment funding for several years. So that the donor may begin seeing the results of the gift at an earlier time, consideration will be given to the possibility of immediately activating the professorship.\nProposals for the early establishment of University-named professorships will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. The following general guidelines will apply:\nThe agreement reached with the donor must be of an irrevocable nature -- charitable remainder trust, charitable gift annuity, estate note, etc.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where approval has been received, the donor must commit through a multi-year pledge of 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year until the endowment income becomes available. A term of at least five years is preferred.\n\t\t\u00a0\nActivation of a professorship through annual gifts will require that all parties be informed that funding of the professorship will continue as long as resources are available.\nTITLE CONTINUATION INTO EMERITUS RANK:\nAn individual eligible for emeritus rank holding a University-Named Title will continue such title designation.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual may also apply, especially;\nFN03 - Substantiation, Disclosure, and Accountability for the Receipt of Contributions from Non-Governmental Sources, and the related Guideline,\nFNG01 - Flow and Accountability of Gifts and Grants from Non-Governmental Sources.\n(Revised endowment minimum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the University's policy on University-named professorships."},{"university":"psu","name":"rag51","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesCentral Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment \n\n\n\nResearch Administration Guidelines\n\nRAG51\nCentral Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nSubject Matter Expert:\u00a0\n\n    Ruth Weber,\n    814-867-1463,\n    \n      rim100@psu.edu    \n\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Research and Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nGuidelines\nCentral Matching Funds Example\nApproval Procedures\nAccess to Matching Funds\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nGUIDELINES:\nCentral matching funds for the acquisition of research equipment are available only when a research proposal is submitted to an external agency\/sponsor seeking funds for the acquisition of research equipment. This program does not provide matching funds for donated or acquired equipment from a non-sponsored source. Central matching funds are intended for the acquisition of research equipment only if the funding agency\/sponsor requires matching.\nAll requests for Central matching funds are reviewed in the Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR), and approval is subject to meeting these guidelines and the availability of funds. The approval of Central matching funds is not automatic.\nResearch equipment is defined as one major piece of research equipment or a series of items that function as a single piece of research equipment. Other related costs that may be included in the calculation of Central matching funds are delivery, setup and up to one year of initial technical support, salaries (for setup), or installation of the research equipment.

Projection equipment and projectionists are also available.\nStage production management, technical personnel, theatrical lighting, staging, and sound equipment are all arranged through the appropriate CPA staff.\nAT RECREATION BUILDING:\nStage production management, technical personnel, theatrical lighting, staging and sound equipment may be arranged through CPA Management, subject to the approval of the CPA Assistant Director. The Associate Athletic Director for Facilities and Operations may insist that CPA Management must be engaged in order for an event to take place. If such a request is made and CPA Management is not able to provide the necessary support, the Associate Athletic Director for Facilities and Operations has to right to refuse approval for the use of the facility.\nThe Associate Athletic Director for Facilities and Operations and the appropriate representative from the various user groups will determine, in advance, which party will assume responsibility for making special program-related arrangements such as front-of-house management and personnel, box office personnel, security, physical plant services, etc.\nAT BRYCE JORDAN CENTER:\nFacility management will determine the needs and make the necessary arrangements for the procurement and set-up of all local production equipment. Touring shows traveling with their own production equipment may use it in Bryce Jordan Center, but must hire the designated Bryce Jordan Center employees to adapt the equipment to the facility.\nEXPENSES AND BILLING FOR AUDITORIUM SERVICES:\nExpenses incurred for auditorium services rendered for the use of auditoriums will be billed to the user. A schedule of charges (approved by the Corporate Controller according to Policy AD15) is available at the respective Center. All service charges are subject to change.\nUsers are also responsible for special custodial costs related to a specific use. Such custodial services will be arranged by the CPA Assistant Director (for events in Eisenhower and Schwab Auditoriums), the Associate Athletic Director for Facilities and Operations (for events in Recreation Building), or the General Manager (for events at Bryce Jordan Center).\nThere are no \"average\" cleaning costs for a typical use. Charges will vary according to the amount of time required to prepare and clean the facility, whether work must be performed on an overtime basis, and the amount of services needed.\nTICKETS:\nAll tickets for events staged at Eisenhower and Schwab Auditoriums, the Playhouse and Pavilion Theaters, the Recreation Building, and the Bryce Jordan Center may be purchased through the integrated Penn State ticket system. Current practice permits football tickets to be purchased only through the Intercollegiate Athletics Ticket Office.\nThree ticket administrations are established within the integrated Penn State ticket system; the Arts Ticket Center, the Intercollegiate Athletics Ticket Office, and the Ticket Center at the Bryce Jordan Center. Each entity will be responsible for the ticket administration of events arranged by their respective organizations.\nThe integrated Penn State ticket system is designed to allow all three entities to sell each others' tickets at their respective sales locations. The three ticket organizations will enter into agreements with each other to determine the method of operation and financial considerations to provide this service.\nAll three ticketing services have the capability of providing counter, telephone, mail order, fax, and Internet sales. In addition, the Ticket Center at the Bryce Jordan Center has equipped outlets throughout central Pennsylvania to provide convenient sales locations to patrons. Convenience fees may apply to the customer for certain services to offset the cost of those services. These fees must be approved by the Corporate Controller.\nFor individual events at their respective venue, each of the three ticketing services will be responsible for:\nProgramming the ticket information onto the ticket system,\nAll accounting functions,\nAll ticket sellers at their location, and\nDistribution of all pertinent information to the other ticketing services selling their tickets under the aforementioned agreements.\nAll tickets selling for $5.00 and over will be subject to Regional County Impact fee as set forth by the University. Each Management shall so inform each user, sponsor, promoter, etc. as to the schedule of said fee at the time of requesting an event date. Such fee schedules shall be made available in writing upon request. The handling of this fee, whether to include it in the ticket price (absorb as overhead) or add it onto the ticket price (recoup the cost from the patron), will be determined by the designated facility administrator for each event.\nUsers of the designated facilities must use the ticket service provided, or receive a written waiver from the designated facility administrator. If a waiver is given, the ticketing system will not be involved in any phase of ticketing (including the use of box offices at these Penn State facilities) for the event, and the user will be responsible for the entire ticket operation.\nIf an event is to be presented at no charge to students and\/or the public, the designated facility administrator reserves the right to require that tickets be issued by the user (or the ticket system). This procedure is to assist in matters of safety and crowd control.\nIf, during review of any event, the designated facility administrator identifies a specific problem concerning tickets, a memo must be directed to the sponsor to specify the problem and suggest a solution (special ticket back-printing, supplemental hand-out, advertising, etc.).\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD02 - Non-University Groups Using University Facilities,\nAD03 - Conducting Educational Programs Using the Name of The University,\nAD15 - Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services,\nAD66 - Service Animal Policy,\nAD73 - Accessing Athletic and Recreational Facilities,\nGuideline ADG04 Providing Emergency Medical Services at University Events at University Park,\nSY18 - Bomb Threats, and\nProcedure #IA2005 - Food and Beverage Sales at Intercollegiate Athletics Facilities.\nMost recent changes:\nJuly 18, 2018 - Editorial change to update links to Procedure IA2005.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\n\nMay 9, 2018 - Editorial change to update the link to Procedure SA6003.\n\n\nOctober 9, 2012 - Major revisions throughout the entire policy to reflect current operations, including the addition\/inclusion of the new Pegula Ice Arena.\n\nOctober 2, 2002 - Revised the following:\nScheduling Priorities for Eisenhower Auditorium and Schwab Auditorium revised to add the events and activities of the College of Arts & Architecture, and consideration of events and programs dictated by academics and the University's official calendar.\nThe Assistant Director of the Center for the Performing Arts has the responsibility for scheduling Eisenhower and Schwab Auditoriums.\nThe time frame for determining the annual usage of Eisenhower and Schwab Auditoriums has changed.\nAdded provisions for requesting use of Eisenhower and Schwab Auditoriums.\nAdded procedure for requesting use of Recreation Building.\nThe Center for Performing Arts Assistant Director is now assigned numerous roles previously performed by the General Manager and Center Director.\nAdded provisions for Assistant Director review of leases and contracts.\nAdded Associate Athletic Director as an approver for certain production aspects involving Recreation Building.\nGave right to the CPA Assistant Director, General Manager of the Bryce Jordan Center, and the Associate Athletic Director to establish rules and regulations for the use and operation of their respective facilities.\nRewrote the provisions for House Personnel Requirements and Production Personnel Requirements.\nAssociate Athletic Director may insist the CPA Management be engaged in events at Recreation Building.\nEliminated the policy section section REQUESTING AUDITORIUM PRODUCTION SERVICES and SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR EISENHOWER AND AUDITORIUMS.\nThe name \"SELECT ticket system\" changed to \"integrated Penn State ticket system.\"\nReworded the provision for tickets subject to the Regional County Impact fee\n\nJuly 16, 1996 - Revised section on Ticketing.\nSeptember 14, 1982 -\nRenamed the \"University Auditorium\" to \"Eisenhower Auditorium.\"\nChanges made to position titles.\nSpecified coordination between Manager of the Ticket Center and the Manager of University Auditoriums.\nEliminated Building Usage Agreement form.\nChanged house personnel requirements.\nTransferred responsibility of tickets from Department of Auditorium Management to the Art Services Ticket Center.\n\nJuly 1, 1976 - New policy.\n\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nSeptember 10, 2012>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nOctober 9, 2012>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nOctober 9, 2012>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To state the University's policy with respect to the scheduling and use of Eisenhower Auditorium, Schwab Auditorium, Recreation Building, Pegula Ice Arena and the Bryce Jordan Center.NOTES: At University Park, scheduling of events in auditoriums other than those noted above (such as within academic colleges, Kern Building, Keller Building, etc.) is determined within each respective administrative area.

For animal activities at University Park and all other campus locations except COM, the University Park IACUC is the responsible committee. Animal research, teaching or testing at the COM is reviewed and approved by the Penn State Hershey IACUC. Any such project involving an external sponsor must be reviewed and approved by the responsible IACUC before funding is accepted.\nIACUC records are subject to regular unannounced inspections by representatives of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA inspection reports describe any institutional deficiencies or apparent IACUC record violations, and are accessible to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. For this reason, all IACUC submissions must be carefully prepared and detailed; a written memo must document all submission supplements or clarifications. The Office for Research Protections (ORP) is responsible for coordinating IACUC reviews and approvals for all University campuses and colleges except for the COM.\u00a0 The Office of Vice-Dean for Research, is responsible for coordinating IACUC reviews and approvals at the COM.\nConcerns regarding the proper care and use of vertebrate animals in a University project are to be reported to the ORP, Office of Vice-Dean for Research, Attending Veterinarian, Institutional Official, IACUC Chair or Penn State Hotline (1-800-560-1637). All reports of concern will be handled anonymously, investigated by the appropriate IACUC and resolved in a timely manner.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy is applicable to all research, testing or teaching activities involving vertebrate animals (live or dead*) or animal parts except as excluded below, conducted under the auspices of the University and applies to all University locations, including the COM. University projects involving the use of vertebrate animals at other institutions must receive IACUC approvals from both the cooperating institution and the University. The COM will serve as the cooperating institution during a collaborative effort between the COM and any other University college or campus location.\n* The IACUC reviews the use of dead animals to verify that they originate from a reputable source and are disposed of appropriately.\nEXCLUSIONS:\nThe following materials are excluded from this policy and are exempt from IACUC review:\n1. Animal tissues or parts collected from animals euthanized under an approved IACUC protocol.\n2. Animal tissues or parts collected from USDA inspected slaughter houses (except at COM where IACUC review and approval may be required).\n3. Established cell lines, as well as biological fluids and foods available as standard inventory from a conventional commercial supplier.\nDEFINITIONS:\n Vertebrate Animal --\n\tThe University defines an animal as being any non-human organism possessing a well-developed nervous system as characterized by the presence of a dorsal notochord protected by a vertebral column. This policy applies to both live and dead animals.IACUC--\n\tThese committees, one located at University Park and one located at the COM, are appointed to review all proposed research, testing or teaching activities involving vertebrate animals to be conducted under the auspices of the University. Projects are reviewed for compliance with the principals of humane animal care and use as set forth by policies and regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Public Health Service. The membership of this committee provides for a balanced review of all submitted activities by inclusion of veterinarians, faculty, staff, and local community representatives.\nSUBMISSION PROCEDURE:\nSubmission forms for all University campuses and colleges except for the COM can be accessed through the ORP website. Completed forms are submitted to the ORP through the electronic submission process or by email.\u00a0 Submissions received by ORP will be circulated to IACUC members.\nSubmission forms for Penn State College of Medicine can be accessed through the College of Medicine IACUC Office web site.\u00a0 Completed forms are submitted to the College of Medicine IACUC Office by email to IACUC@pennstatehealth.psu.edu and will be circulated to the IACUC members.\nThe IACUC has final authority to disapprove or suspend indefinitely an activity involving the use of vertebrate animals.\nAppeals will be heard by the IACUC; however, by federal law the IACUC has final authority and disapprovals cannot be overruled by any administrator at the University.\nBIOHAZARDOUS AGENTS AND RADIOISOTOPES IN ANIMALS:\nAny IACUC submission involving a biohazardous agent or radioisotope also will require prior approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee or theUniversity Isotopes Committee, respectively. The investigator is to include, in the IACUC submission, a safety protocol describing procedures for work with biohazardous materials used with animals. The University Biosafety Officer, in consultation with animal care personnel, will aid investigators in designing appropriate safety protocols for the handling and disposal of animals contaminated with biohazardous materials. The University Health Physicist will advise investigators in the development of safety protocols involving the use of radioisotopes.\nAny submission to the COM IACUC involving a biohazardous agent, radioisotope, or hazardous chemical will require prior approval by the COM Institutional Biosafety and Recombinant DNA Committee, Health Physicist or Chemical Hygiene Officer respectively. The Biosafety Officer, Health Physicist or Chemical Hygiene Officer, in consultation with the Department of Comparative Medicine staff, will assist investigators and research staff in designing appropriate safety protocols for the handling and proper disposal of animals contaminated by any hazardous agent.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially:\nSY20 - Hazardous Waste Disposal,\nSY24 - Use of Biohazardous Materials in Research and Instruction, and\nHM-15SPM \u2013 Biohazardous Materials, Use in Research and Instruction.\n\u00a0\nEffective Date: March 14, 2016\n\tDate Approved: March 3, 2016\n\tDate Published: March 14, 2016 (Editorial change, May 17, 2017)\nMost recent changes:\nMay 17, 2017 - Editorial changes made; the second paragraph of the SUBMISSION PROCEDURE section has been updated to reflect the current processing for submission forms.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMarch 14, 2016 - Revisions have been made throughout the policy to include the IACUC at the College of Medicine and other references relating to the College of Medicine, to have a unified policy for the University.\nJune 8, 2015 - This policy was previously a Research Administration policy, RA15.

The University employs these communication tools to communicate to all students, faculty and staff (or large subsets of those groups) on a number of topics, including employment, scheduling and emergencies. Using such communication tools in this fashion at Penn State have improved the efficiency of University communications while reducing costs and dramatically reducing the need for the use of paper and the need for recycling.\nWhile recognizing the importance of this type of communication, the University also recognizes that its misuse could be counterproductive, so this policy is set forth with the intention that the use of group communication tools to communicate with both employees and students be used only when the subject is of legitimate concern to the majority of those receiving it, and only if properly screened and authorized.\nPOLICY:\nThe University may, as needed, use group communication tools to communicate with all employees (or subsets of them) on matters of official University business that require immediate notification or that are of a sufficient level of importance to warrant special attention. The University may also use group communication tools to communicate with students in the event of emergencies or where other means are impractical. With the exception of the Emergency Notification System, any such group communications to employees or students must be approved by the Vice President for Strategic Communications, the Executive Vice President and Provost, or the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business, and should be limited to those matters that affect the majority of the defined group.\nGUIDELINES:\nEMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM (\"PSU ALERT\" & \"Penn State Health Alerts\")\nPSU ALERT, overseen by the University Police and Public Safety Office, is Penn State's official emergency text messaging system. Penn State Health and the College of Medicine will utilize a separate emergency notification system, referred to as Penn State Health Alerts. \u00a0Both systems allow information to be sent via multiple platforms, including\u00a0text messages, e-mail and social media. \u00a0PSU Alert and Penn State Health Alerts are the only emergency communication short message services (SMS) authorized to send emergency or crisis information to the University community.\nPSU ALERT authorized senders are vetted and trained by University Police and Public Safety. Instructions for sending alerts is provided in the PSU ALERT Procedures.\nPenn State Health Alerts authorized senders are vetted and trained by Information Technology and the Department of Safety\/Emergency Preparedness Office at the Hershey Medical Center. \u00a0Instructions for sending alerts are provided in the Penn State Health Alert Procedures.\nAn \"emergency\" is defined as any unplanned event that can cause death or significant injuries to faculty, staff, students, or the public, OR that can shut down business, disrupt normal operations, cause physical or environmental damage, or can threaten the institution's financial standing or public image. These emergencies or crises may be man-made or natural.\nAll cellular phones which are issued for University use or are supported by a taxable allowance, must subscribe to the PSU ALERT emergency messaging system, if the phone provides for text messaging services.\nOTHER TEXT MESSAGING SYSTEMS\nWhen considering the use of texting for communicating with students, faculty or staff, it is important to ensure that its use is appropriate and cost effective. In this context, users are therefore advised to note the following:\nAll texts sent on University systems should make it clear to the receivers which unit has sent the message or where it originated.\nTexts sent from University systems or smart phones must never contain any offensive, abusive or inappropriate language.\nUnits using mobile phones as a way to communicate to employees should have a record of the mobile phone numbers which will be used to send the texts - ideally, this should be a single number, used consistently.\nAll texting from University mobile phones should be for business-related purposes.\nUniversity issued cell phones or smart phones should be password protected.\nDon't text and drive at the same time.\nIt should be noted that there is no guarantee that text messages will be delivered promptly or at all by the mobile phone companies.\nText messaging must not be used as the sole means of communicating an urgent or essential message to employees.\nText messaging should NOT be used for:\nCommunicating personal or confidential information.\nRepeat reminders of messages already circulated.\nPersonal matters (e.g., items for sale, farewell messages).\nAppeals on behalf of individual or groups of students (e.g. to attend academic related or social gatherings or events).\nAvoid sending private University data in text messages.\nDon't send social security numbers, passwords or credit card numbers in text messages.\nFor additional information and rules on texting with University-owned phones as well as those supported by taxable allowances, refer to Policy FN21.\nGROUP EMAIL\nLike text messaging systems, group emails are also an effective method of communicating important information to a portion of either the faculty, staff or students. They may be preferable over texting when the volume of information being passed is sizeable. As such, group emails sent on University systems:\nMust make it clear to the receivers which unit has sent the message or where it originated.\nMust be for business-related purposes.\nMust NOT contain any offensive, abusive or inappropriate language.\nMust NOT pass on personal information or appeals on behalf of individual or groups of students (e.g. to attend academic related or social gatherings or events).\nMust NOT pass social security numbers, passwords or credit card numbers.\nMust NOT be used for personal matters (e.g., items for sale, farewell messages).\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact Police and Public Safety.\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially;\nAD96 - Acceptable Use of University Information Resources\nAD70 - Emergency Management\nAD67 - Disclosure of Wrongful Conduct and Protection From Retaliation\nAD74 - Compliance With the Clery Act\nAD76 - Emergency Notifications on Digital Signage\nAD78 - Threats to Campus Safety\nMost recent changes:\nAugust 15, 2017 - Edits to the GUIDELINES section reflecting an exception for the Milton S.

The College reserves the right to cancel, postpone or reschedule any other function or event as necessary.\nUse for events conducted other units of the University, or organizations affiliated with the University (e.g., alumni organizations, recognized student organizations, conference groups), shall have priority over all uses except those of the College of Agricultural Sciences.\nUse for events conducted by persons or organizations not affiliated with the University will be permitted only if space and dates are available, and any approval for such use is subject to cancellation if a higher priority use is approved.\nUSE BY NON-UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATIONS:\nPersons or organizations not affiliated with the University may use the facilities only for activities and purposes which are in support of the mission and goals of the College of Agricultural Sciences or the general aims and purposes of the University. (See Administrative Policy AD02)\nThe University will charge a rental fee for the use of the facilities and may require reimbursement for additional services and equipment. All established fees must have the approval of the Corporate Controller per Administrative Policy AD15. The reimbursement or fee will include operating and overhead expenses incurred as a result of the approved use.\nCompliance with all applicable University regulations and local, state and federal laws is required. The University's authorization of the use of the facilities does not represent endorsement of the aims and purposes of the sponsoring organization or of the event. Any use of the name of the University, other than to indicate the location of the event, must be approved in advance in writing by the University through the Office of the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business\/Treasurer. (See Policy AD07.)\nSAFETY AND GENERAL WELFARE:\nNon-university and non-recognized student organizations must agree to take all necessary and reasonable precautions to assure the physical safety of the participants and the protection of University property. The organization must release the University from any liability in conjunction with the use of the facility. The University Release and Indemnification Agreement must be used for this purpose (see the applicable instructions\u00a0in GURU). University Release and Indemnification Agreement forms are available from the Manager of the Agricultural Arena and the Manager of the Ag Progress Days facilities. A copy of the signed University Release and Indemnification Agreement will be forwarded to Penn State\u2019s Risk Management Office (103 Rider Bldg., State College, PA 16801) for review.\u00a0 The University reserves the right to require insurance coverage or proof of liability insurance from the organization. In addition, the University may require the presence of University Safety or Security personnel for any group requesting to use University facilities. This will be an additional expense to the user (See Administrative Guideline ADG04).\nCOMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES:\nNeither advertisements or notices concerning the sale or rental of merchandise or services, nor political notices or announcements, may be placed or erected in or around the facilities. During an event, facility managers may pre-approve designated areas for non-commercial and non-political posters which have an applicable purpose.\nThe use of University facilities and\/or property for commercial sales activities by individuals or non-University organizations is prohibited.\u00a0(See Administrative Policy AD27) This prohibition does not apply to the pre-approved University-sponsored events where commercial products may be demonstrated, displayed, or purchased as a secondary activity to support the primary educational purpose of the event.\nSALES AND SERVING OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES:\nThe sale and service of food and\/or beverages at any function or program open to the public and\/or community by other than authorized University departments such as Housing and Food Services, Penn State Hospitality Services, University Creamery, or by an accepted external food and beverage provider contracting for food and beverage services is prohibited. (See Administrative Policy AD26)\nFUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES:\nFundraising activities must be conducted in conjunction with, or co-sponsored by a recognized student organization, University College, Department or Administrative unit. Co-sponsorship must be by a bona fide parallel-interest organization with equal participation in the planning and implementation of the activity.\u00a0 A detailed plan for the designation of funds must be specifically approved by the appropriate budget executive.

Any violation of the rules and regulations by any user will cause forfeiture of all originally granted rights, without recourse. The respective Manager of each facility shall be the final judge of any violation.\nEVENTS INVOLVING THE USE OF ANIMALS:\nIf the event involves the use of animals, the following rules must be adhered to:\nThe University Veterinarian must be provided with the following information, through the respective Manager's office at least 30 days in advance of the event:\nThe name of the organization holding the event and contact person.\nThe species of animal involved.\nThe date and type of event (show, sale, demonstration, etc.).\nBased on this information the University Veterinarian may require specific health information for individual animals participating in the event.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAt a minimum: All animals originating from outside the Commonwealth must have valid health certificates, issued by an accredited veterinarian, that certifies that the animals are healthy and meet the exhibition and\/or sales health requirements for that species as determined by the Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Service of the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.\nAnimals from within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania may be required to have a valid health certificate issued by an accredited veterinarian depending on the event as determined by the University Veterinarian.\u00a0 Animals must be current on all vaccinations including rabies if appropriate for the species.\u00a0 Animals should have proof of vaccination on the day of the event. When events involve only University owned animals, only healthy animals that have been housed in University facilities for at least 30 days and have passed the health control programs for admission to the University herds and flocks shall be eligible.\nWhen events involve one or more animals not owned by the University, either alone or with one or more University animals, each animal on the premises must be accompanied by a valid health certificate issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services.\u00a0 Each animal also must meet current requirements for shows and sales established by the Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services for the particular species involved.\nThe University veterinarian shall have the authority to inspect all health certificates and animals entering the premises, to enforce the above policies, and to reject other animals.\u00a0 Animals that arrive without the proper health information will be denied entry to the facility.\nTo protect the health of both University and non-University animals, the University veterinarian may issue additional health requirements for certain events in an emergency or other unusual situation.\nAt least seven days must elapse between the use of the facility by animals, both prior to and following the event.\nDuring these seven days, all manure and bedding must be removed and the paved surfaces cleaned and sanitized according to current recommendations by the University Veterinarian.\n\nPROCEDURE FOR REQUESTING USE OF FACILITIES:\nAll groups wishing to use the Agricultural facilities within the above policy guidelines shall:\nSubmit an agreement \u00a0to use the respective facility:\nManager, Snider Agricultural Arena, Farm Service Building, University Park, PA 16802; Telephone (814) 865-4433; email agarena@psu.edu\nAg Progress Days Manager, 318C Tyson Building, University Park, PA 16802; Telephone (814) 865-2081; email agprogressdays@psu.edu\n\nIf the agreement has been reviewed by appropriate personnel and approved, facility management will provide the applicant with a fully executed signed agreement.\nUsers of the facilities must submit all University required documents, such as Certificate of Insurance and Indemnification Agreement, to the appropriate Ag Facility Manager\u2019s Office, no later than 21 business days prior to the event.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Dean, College of Agricultural Sciences.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may have specific application and should be referred to, especially;\nAD02 - Non-University Groups Using University Facilities\nAD15 - Fees and Charges for Facilities and Services\nAD18 - Possession, Use and Distribution of Alcoholic Beverages\nAD26 - Sale and serving of Food and Beverages at University Locations\nAD27 - Commercial Sales Activities at University Locations\nAD32 - Smoking Policy and Guideline\nAD39 - Minors Involved in University-Sponsored Programs or Programs Held at the University and\/or Housed in University Facilities (Formerly Programs Involving Minors Housed in University Facilities)\nAD51 - Use of Outdoor Areas for Expressive Activities\nADG04 - Providing Emergency Medical Services at University Events at University Park\nFN10 - Other Business Expenses and Activities\nFN14 - Use of Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services\nSY13 - Open Fires\nMost Recent changes:\nApril 20, 2018 - Editorial change to update links to the University Release and Indemnification Agreement instructions and form.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nApril 13, 2016 - Major revisions to the policy to reflect current operations.\nJune 15, 2006 - Revision History added.\nJune 1, 1998 - Position Title updated, and referenced Administrative Guideline ADG04, EMT Services.\nSeptember 19, 1994 - College and Position Titles updated.\nMarch 17, 1989 - Added Ag Progress Days Facilities.\nMay 18, 1987 - Revised \"Procedure For Requesting Approval\" section.\nJuly 26, 1984 - New Policy.\n\u00a0\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nApril 11, 2016>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nApril 13, 2016>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nApril 13, 2016>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The purpose of this policy is to specify the allowable uses of the buildings, equipment and\/or property of the Agricultural Arena and the Agricultural Progress Days sites (collectively referred to as \u201cfacilities\u201d) by The Pennsylvania State University (\"University\"), the College of Agricultural Sciences (\u201cCollege\u201d), and agricultural groups not affiliated with the University.

Colleges, campuses and budgetary units already using digital signage that was installed before this policy was enacted should add the emergency message feeds if the digital signage can accept the feed. Existing digital signage that cannot accept the emergency notification feed without substantial cost may be exempted from this policy; however, if any modifications or upgrades are made to the existing digital signage, the ability to accept emergency notification feeds must be included in the upgrades. When existing digital signage is replaced, it must be replaced with equipment that can accept the feeds.\nExemptions to this policy also include digital sign boards that serve as menu displays for both Penn State eateries and commercial eateries, contracted to be on Penn State property.\nGENERAL:\nPenn State holds an enterprise license agreement for digital signage software. \u00a0Digital signage software is used to manage information, including news and messaging, which is then made available for public viewing on electronic displays in buildings and classrooms throughout the University. The software also makes it possible for offices to display critical emergency messages in collaboration with the University's central news services such as PSU ALERT. \u00a0The software includes methods for administrators to automatically send out emergency notifications to signs. To ensure digital signs automatically will broadcast Penn State emergencies, each sign needs to be configured with the emergency channel settings.\nDigital signage software orders are processed through Software at Penn State. The software license may be purchased directly via https:\/\/software.psu.edu\/all-products\/browse\/keyword\/four-winds.\u00a0 The software requires an annual maintenance subscription. \u00a0Users then receive the Software Interactive Content Manager, Content Player licenses and access to Four Winds Interactive Store.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact University Police & Public Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD70 - Emergency Management,\nSY03 - Emergencies Involving Students\nMost recent changes:\nJanuary 10, 2017 - Update to the POLICY section to clarify what digital signage is exempted from policy requirements.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nNovember 7, 2016 - The GENERAL section has been revised to reflect current operations.\nJuly 28, 2015 - Editorial changes.

The Federal regulations that govern program income are identified in OMB Uniform Guidance.\n\n\nPROGRAM INCOME - DEFINITION:\nUniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.80:\nProgram income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided in\u00a0\u00a7200.307 paragraph (f). (See\u00a0\u00a7200.77 Period of performance.) Program income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, . . . and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them.

See also HRG05, Use of \"No-Pay\" Days in Lieu of Short-Term Absence.\nFor formal study which results in promoting the interests of the University, as well as those of the faculty or staff member, in the judgment of the dean or administrative officer (see the HRG13).\nFor any other reason determined to be at the convenience of the University in the judgment of the dean or administrative officer.\nACADEMIC ADMINISTRATOR, AND ACADEMIC:\nThe period during which an individual classified as Executive, Administrator, Academic Administrator, or Academic may be on leave of absence without salary is governed by the following conditions:\nA leave is granted for a specific period of time to begin on a date specified by the University.\nThe length of a leave is determined as follows:\nA leave of more than four (4) consecutive calendar months is granted only until the next June 30.\nA leave of four (4) consecutive months or less may be granted regardless of the dates that the leave begins and ends.\n\nEach leave of absence ending on a June 30 is reviewed on that date. Action is then taken to renew or stop the leave.\nA leave of absence without salary normally will not exceed twelve (12) consecutive calendar months. It may not exceed a maximum of twenty-four (24) consecutive calendar months.\nLENGTH OF LEAVE FOR STAFF:\nThe period during which an individual classified as Staff may be on leave of absence without salary is governed by the following conditions:\nA leave is granted for a specific period of time to begin on a date specified by the University.\nA leave of absence granted to an employee because of his or her inability to perform his or her duties due to illness or injury (non-job related) is limited as follows:\nMaximum Amount of Leave For Staff\nLength of Continuous Regular Service of Any Type\n\t\t\t\tWith the University at the Start of the Leave\nMaximum Length of Leave Granted\nThrough first 6 months*\nup to 1 month\nEnd of 6th month through 1st year\nup to 3 months\nEnd of 1st year through 2nd year\nup to 6 months\nEnd of 2nd year through 3rd year\nup to 9 months\nEnd of 3rd year through 4th year\nup to 12 months\nEnd of 4th year through 5th year\nup to 15 months\nEnd of 5th year through 10th year\nup to 18 months\nEnd of 10th year or more\nup to 24 months\n*Employees who have at least 12 months of University service (regular and\/or non-regular), working at least 1,250 hours (regular and\/or non-regular) during the previous 12-month period may be eligible for a longer leave of absence. See HRG11 for details.\nAbsence for extended sick leave in accordance with the time limits established above will be continued only for the period of time the employee is unable to perform his or her duties because of his or her illness or injury. If the employee does not report to work after being physically able to report to work, his or her employment shall be terminated. If, at the end of the leave of absence the employee is still unable to work, employment will be terminated and all benefits of the leave of absence without salary will end.\nA leave of absence without salary for other than illness or injury normally will not exceed twelve (12) consecutive calendar months. It may not exceed a maximum of twenty-four (24) consecutive calendar months.\nIf any employee returns to active employment following a leave of absence, and within sixty (60) calendar days returns to leave of absence status for the same illness or injury, the amount of time previously charged to leave of absence shall be counted against the appropriate allowance for maximum length of leave.\nCOSTS FOR UNIVERSITY INSURANCES WHILE ON LEAVE:\nCosts for insurances in which enrolled during a leave of absence without salary for sickness, maternity, family care as specified in HRG11, or formal study, shall be at the regular employee rates of contribution.\nCosts for insurances in which enrolled during a leave of absence without salary for other than the reasons enumerated in the paragraph above shall be the entire cost (employee and University costs) for those benefits.\nNOTE: A decision not to continue the insurances is considered a break in continuous benefits participation and may have an adverse effect on the employee's eligibility to continue the insurances after retirement (see HR54). If coverage is not continued during the leave and is requested at a later date the following restrictions will apply. Except as provided by law, proof of eligibility will be required for re-enrollment in life insurance, long-term disability\/annuity premium benefit and long-term care. Medical, dental, vision, accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) can be requested only during the annual open enrollment period and will be effective January 1 following the open enrollment period.\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT PLANS WHILE ON LEAVE:\nA faculty or staff member who is on leave of absence without salary, regardless of the reason, is not eligible to contribute or receive credit in any retirement plan unless he or she is a member of, and makes private arrangements to contribute to, TIAA-CREF. However, retirement contributions will be deducted from any amounts earned from the University during any leave.\nADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR ADMINISTRATOR AND STAFF EMPLOYEES:\nAn employee receives service credit for the purpose of increasing his or her vacation accumulation rate.\nAn employee does not accumulate any additional vacation or sick leave unless the employee is paid for enough days in any calendar month to qualify.An employee is not paid for holidays that occur during the leave.\nThe cash equivalent of the vacation accumulation, service days, and compensatory time due an employee is paid at the beginning of a leave of absence, except for a leave in excess of paid sick leave, maternity, family care as specified in HRG11, or leave as the result of an on-the-job injury.\nAn employee retains paid sick leave (except for a leave in excess of paid sick leave or maternity leave); however, paid sick leave may not be used during a leave of absence.\nFor additional information, see HR92 for administrator employees and HR34 for staff employees.\nRETURN TO ACTIVE SERVICE:\nIf conditions are the same at the end of the leave of absence as they were when the leave began, the faculty or staff member will be expected to return to active service. If he or she does not return at the end of the leave of absence, his or her employment is terminated and all benefits of the leave of absence without salary will end.\nELIGIBILITY FOR EDUCATIONAL PRIVILEGES WHILE ON LEAVE:\nA faculty or staff member who is on a leave without salary for sickness, maternity, family care as specified in HRG11, or formal study, and who is eligible for educational privileges, will retain those privileges, during the term of the leave. Dependents of such faculty or staff members who are eligible for grants-in-aid will retain this eligibility during the term of the leave.

Personal property means property other than real property. It may be tangible, having physical existence, or intangible (2 CFR 200.78).\nEquipment:\u00a0 Per the Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.33\u00a0\"equipment\u00a0means tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non-Federal entity for financial statement purposes, or $5,000.\"\nUNIVERSITY CAPITALIZATION CRITERIA:\nThe University has established the following criteria for capitalization of property (buildings\/land), equipment, and software:\nBuildings\/Land: All new purchases of buildings, facilities, and land are capitalized. (No dollar threshold applies.) Renovations are capitalized if they extend the life of the asset and exceed $250,000 or 20% of book value of item. Normal, routine repairs are treated as non-capital.\nEquipment: All stand-alone tangible items with a useful life or one year or more and a value of $5,000 or more are capitalized. This includes equipment fabricated by a department for which the amount capitalized would include the actual costs of materials.\u00a0 See Procedure CR2019 \u2013 Accounting for Capital Equipment for more detail on fabricated equipment.\nSoftware: Software purchases over $100,000 are capitalized.\nData: Data purchases are not subject to capitalization.\nAdditional detailed information regarding equipment capitalization is available from Property Inventory. See also Procedure CR2019 \u2013 Accounting for Capital Equipment.\u00a0\nEQUIPMENT OWNED\/PROVIDED BY SPONSOR:\nSponsor provision of equipment on consignment should be reported to Property inventory on Report of Tangible Assets Acquired by Consignment, Lease, or Loan Form and (Procedure CR2019) to ensure:\nAdequate insurance coverage is provided,\nProperty control is maintained during project period,\nProject is closed out properly in accordance with all reporting and property disposition requirements.\nEXPORT CONTROL:\nSee RA40 \u00a0- Compliance with Federal Export Regulations for detail regarding property and equipment to be used outside the U.S.\u00a0 Principal Investigators are responsible for understanding and complying with export control regulations.\u00a0 The University Export Compliance Officer can be contacted for assistance.\nSPECIFIC POLICY - SOURCE OF FUNDING:\nFEDERAL:\nEQUIPMENT OWNERSHIP:\nThe Federal government will sometimes grant title of equipment to Penn State. In other cases, the Federal government will grant \"conditional\" title to Penn State, which means Penn State must request disposition instructions from the Federal government when the \"equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal awarding agency\" (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.313). In yet other cases, the Federal government will retain title to the equipment. Penn State must submit annually an inventory listing of federally owned property in its custody to the Federal awarding agency.\nTitle to equipment purchased under federal contracts is typically defined in conjunction with FAR 52.245-1. Title to equipment purchased under federal grants and cooperative agreements is defined by Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.313, unless otherwise defined by agency-specific terms and conditions.\n\"OTHER USE\" DURING PROJECT:\nIf the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.\nIf Penn State has title to the equipment (including conditional title), Penn State is expected to make such equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal government if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. Use for non-federally-funded programs or projects is also permissible. User fees should be considered if appropriate (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.313(c)(2)).\nUSE AFTER PROJECT PERIOD:\nIf Penn State has title to the equipment (including conditional title), then Penn State shall continue to use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds, and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. If Penn State's title to the equipment is conditional, and Penn State no longer needs the equipment for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal awarding agency, then Penn State must request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency, unless the terms and conditions of the Federal award state otherwise (2 CFR 200.313(e)).\nUSE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AFTER PROJECT PERIOD:\nPer the Uniform Guidance, the recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.313(c)(3). This applies to all equipment purchased through federal funding which is retained after the project period and its use is being charged out through a fee or rate.\nThis means that federally funded equipment used in Research Service Centers or other units charging fees for the use of the equipment, must assure that an appropriate fee, based on federal costing standards, must be charged, in compliance with AD15 \u2013 Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services.\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERALLY OWNED EQUIPMENT:\nFederally-owned equipment requires sponsor or Administrative Contracting Officer approval to:\nTransfer\nLend\nUpgrade\nDisassemble\nDispose\nDestroy\nTrade\nSell\nAt the end of the project period, the University must take one of two actions:\nRequest permission from the sponsor to transfer to another agreement.\nRequest from the sponsor disposition instructions.\nAll Federally-owned equipment has special annual and closeout reporting requirements, especially for contracts under FAR which are overseen by Property Inventory.\u00a0\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) equipment must be tagged with an Item Unique Identification (IUID) tag and entered into the DoD IUID Registry by Property Inventory.\n\"USE FEES\" AS PROGRAM INCOME:\nDuring the project period, all user charges shall be treated as program income and treated in accordance with \u00a0Procedure CR2068 - Property Inventory Depreciation and Usage Fee Guidelines and Policy RA66 \u2013 Program Income.\nCOMMONWEALTH:\nCommonwealth Master Agreement Property Clauses\nThe following requirements are included in the current Commonwealth Master Agreement, which ends on June 30, 2021.\u00a0 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania-sponsored awards which are not under the Master Agreement may have the same or similar clauses and should be reviewed closely to ensure compliance.\nEquipment and expendable property.\u00a0 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (COP) will retain ownership of all capital equipment (>$5,000) and expendable property (<$5,000).\u00a0 \"Expendable property includes, but is not limited to, such items as global positioning systems (GPS), computers, microscopies, tractors, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV).\u00a0 Expendable property does not include such items as office supplies, safety gear, ATV parts, laboratory supplies, etc.\" Capital equipment (including purchase vs. rental costs) and expendable items shall be included in the university budget as presented to the COP agency.\u00a0 The university is to utilize the DGS statewide contract for purchasing computer equipment.\nFinal report of capital equipment and expendable property.\u00a0 Upon cancellation or completion of any purchase order where capital equipment or expendable property were acquired by the university, the university shall provide within sixty (60) days a report to the agency and to DGS consisting of a project summary and an itemized listing of all capital equipment or expendable property purchased for the project.\u00a0 A copy of the invoice for each item shall be attached to the report.\nDisposition of property.\u00a0 Within 60 days of the COP agency's receipt of the final report from the university, the agency will arrange for the pick up or delivery (at Commonwealth expense) of Commonwealth-owned property.\u00a0 In the event the COP agency does not contact the University within 60 days to arrange delivery or pick-up of any Commonwealth owned property, such property will become the property of the University.\nOther Uses Not Allowed. \u00a0Commonwealth-owned property may not be used for any other purpose without prior authorization of the Commonwealth unless such property becomes the University\u2019s property as detailed above.\nThe complete text of these requirements can be found in Article 4 of the Commonwealth Master Agreement.\nINDUSTRIAL:\nProperty ownership clauses vary with industrial agreements as well.\u00a0 PIs should read all property clauses to determine if consignment or ownership requirements necessitate working with Property Inventory.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nProcedure CR2019 \u2013 Accounting for Capital Equipment\nProcedure CR2055 -

PREAMBLE\n \nACADEMIC PRINCIPLES:\n \nThe promotion and tenure policies of the University should contribute to academic excellence. An equitable and widely-understood promotion and tenure system ensures that considerations of academic quality will be the basis for academic personnel decisions.\nTenure is the keystone for academic freedom; safeguarding the right of free expression and risk-taking inquiry is the basis for tenure. Both tenure and academic freedom are bound to an implicit social compact which recognizes that their maintenance serves important public purposes and provides great benefits to society; the ultimate justification for tenure rests on the bedrock of its social utility. Additionally, a well-designed tenure and promotion system attracts capable and highly qualified individuals as faculty members, strengthens institutional stability by enhancing faculty members' institutional loyalty, and encourages academic excellence by retaining and rewarding the most able people. Tenure and promotion imply selectivity and choice; they are awarded for academic and professional merit, not for seniority.\nA formal statement of criteria for tenure and promotion is necessary but not sufficient for the task. The wide variety of academic and professional fields, and the broad range of programs within the University, make the development of detailed criteria, equally applicable to all fields, an unrewarding effort. Rather, general and broad guidelines will permit the exercise of skilled professional and academic judgment in their interpretation and application.\nFor promotion and tenure procedures to be legitimized, they must be open, within considerations of individual privacy, and equitable. The general policies and procedures to be used should be made widely known within departments, campuses, colleges* and the University Libraries. Regular review of faculty members will help to ensure openness of the tenure and promotion process and will provide feedback crucial to faculty development and growth.\nFaculty members have a primary responsibility in providing the evaluations of merit which normally determine the academic personnel decision-making process, including appointment, promotion, and tenure. This responsibility involves the application of academic and professional judgment, in a framework of shared authority, among various levels of review and between faculty and administrative bodies.\nWithin the procedures for granting or denying tenure and promotion, the presumption is that recommendations based on the professional expertise and competence of the faculty will usually be heeded. Where the findings of the various groups differ, there is an implicit responsibility to explore the reasons for divergence. In this way administrators and faculty can sustain vigorous and responsible participation, and standards of excellence and quality can be maintained.\nThe promotion and tenure procedures consist of several levels of judgment and review: the department (or comparable academic unit); the campus; the college or University Libraries; and the University. The initial review will usually take place at the level of the department (or campus as appropriate) and will focus on professional and scholarly judgments of the quality of the individual's academic work. Subsequent levels will bring broader faculty and administrative judgment to bear and will also monitor general standards of quality, equity and adequacy of the procedure used. At each level, the review process will reflect the competence and perspective of the review body.\n*For the purpose of this policy, \"colleges\" are those academic units which have responsibility for developing, obtaining approval, and conducting the University's academic degree programs, as authorized by the University Board of Trustees and the University Faculty Senate.\nII. CRITERIA FOR PROMOTION AND TENURE\nRELATIONSHIP OF MISSION AND STRUCTURE TO CRITERIA:\nPromotion and tenure decisions are based on the academic judgments of faculty and academic administrators. The general criteria or principles outlined here must be applied to promotion and tenure decisions in light of a detailed knowledge of the specific goals of an academic program or organizational unit (e.g., department, college, and the University Libraries) and the specific qualities and competencies of the individual. The University's complex organization and multiple missions make these academic judgments vital, since no one set of criteria can apply equally to all faculty members in all programs. Likewise, such diversity within the University entails promotion and tenure arrangements specifically tailored to the mission and organizational structure of its various academic units (e.g., department, college, and University Libraries).\nACADEMIC EXCELLENCE:\n \nRecognizing the University's manifold responsibilities, however, should not diminish the central importance of teaching and scholarly activity, both understood in their broadest sense, in the academic decision-making process. In tenure and promotion decisions, as in other areas of choice, the University best serves itself and society by affirming the primacy of academic excellence in all of its functions.\nEXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS OF EACH UNIT:\nAn important part of the whole tenure and review process for faculty members is that all parties to the process share common expectations and understandings. Since general statements of principles will be broad and inclusive, each academic unit may develop its own specific expectations and standards as the operational basis for tenure and promotion recommendations. Knowledge concerning these expectations and standards should be generally available, especially to newly appointed faculty members.\nCandidates may include either a narrative statement at the front of the dossier that indicates their sense of their scholarship of teaching and learning, scholarship of research and creative accomplishments, and service and the scholarship of service to the University, society, and the profession, or separate statements in the relevant sections of the dossier describing the same items.\nThe review process for tenure and promotion is concerned with the academic and professional merits of particular candidates, judged in reference to all alternative candidates, including prospective faculty members. Tenure and promotion standards, therefore, cannot be fixed and absolute, but will reflect to some extent the varying competitive positions of the University in attracting faculty. Accordingly, evaluations will be influenced by such considerations of relative standing. Likewise, progressively more exacting scrutiny will take place as the faculty member advances in academic rank.\nCHANGING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES:\nAlthough the tenure and promotion process is geared, narrowly and properly, to evaluating individual performance, the changing needs and priorities of the institution may also affect the decision to grant tenure or award promotion. Both equity and the long-range interests of the institution, however, require directing primary attention to University needs and priorities at the time of appointment and careful intermediate and longer range academic personnel planning.\nGENERAL CRITERIA:\nThe raison d'etre of the University is the discovery, synthesis, transmission, and application of knowledge. In light of these several goals, scholarship of research and creative accomplishments, scholarship of teaching and learning and service and the scholarship of service are the central criteria for the evaluation of faculty.\nPromotion and tenure decisions shall be based on these three criteria, which must be applied in light of the mission of the academic unit and the professional responsibilities carried by the faculty member. The criteria have purposely been made general in the expectation of further definition and elaboration by each academic unit.\nThe Scholarship of Teaching and Learning - ability to convey subject matter to students; demonstrated competence in teaching and capacity for growth and improvement; ability to maintain academic standards, and to stimulate the interests of students in the field; effectiveness of counseling, advising and service to students.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe Scholarship of Research and Creative Accomplishments - competence, usually demonstrated through publication, exhibition, performance, or presentation of scholarly papers, to carry out research or creative work of high quality and scholarly significance and the ability to train students in research methods and practice; evidence of thorough understanding of the field; maintenance of high levels of academic performance; recognized reputation in the subject matter field; evidence of continued professional growth and active contribution to professional organizations.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nService and the Scholarship of Service to the University, Society, and the Profession - participation in the University, college, departmental, and unit affairs; competence in extending specialized knowledge to the University and to the public.\nPromotion and tenure decisions shall be based on recognized performance and achievement in each of the several areas, as appropriate to the particular responsibilities assigned to the faculty member. The presumption is that a positive tenure decision for an assistant professor is sufficient to warrant promotion to associate professor. In an exceptional case, a decision can be made to tenure but not to promote; however, the burden would be on the committee(s) or administrator(s) who wish to separate promotion from a positive tenure decision to show why promotion is not warranted.\nIII. REVIEW PROCEDURES\nGENERAL PROCEDURES:\nPrimary responsibility for evaluation of the academic qualification of candidates for promotion and tenure rests with the faculty. There are three sequential levels in this review: peer review by the department (or comparable academic unit) including campus review as appropriate; review by the college or the University Libraries; and review by the University. The Administrative Guidelines can be found at\u00a0http:\/\/www.psu.edu\/vpaa\/.\nAll levels of review shall be concerned in some measure with both scholarly substance and quality and procedural adequacy and equity. It is incumbent upon each level of review to exercise careful professional judgment of the accomplishments, productivity, and potential of each candidate. Initial peer review (e.g., at the campus or departmental level) will focus on professional and scholarly judgments of the individual's academic work within his or her discipline. Reviews at the college or University Libraries level will bring broader faculty and administrative judgments to bear, and will also monitor general standards of quality, equity, and adequacy of procedures used. Review at the University level will involve similar but less detailed evaluations and, in addition, will provide an essential all-University perspective. Consultation among review levels, by committees and academic administrators, should take place when there is a need to clarify differences that arise during the review process.\nEach academic unit (e.g., department, college, and University Libraries) of the University should take responsibility for developing detailed review procedures, supplemental to and consonant with general University procedures, as guidelines for promotion and tenure. These procedures should be made known to prospective and current faculty members, as well as the general University community, and should reflect the organizational arrangements of each academic unit.\nThe evaluation of teaching effectiveness shall be based on both peer and student input. Specific procedures shall conform to the Statement of Practices for the Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness for Promotion and Tenure.\nFREQUENCY OF REVIEWS:\nPrior to formal consideration of a faculty member for tenure and promotion, evaluations should be conducted by the initial review committees. In the case of tenure, these reviews shall be conducted in the second year and no less often than biennially thereafter. Normally, tenure reviews will be conducted in the second and fourth years of the provisional appointment period. For second and fourth year reviews, the college dean shall be required to write evaluative letters that are shared with candidates and may be addressed directly to them. The dean's letter will then be included in the dossiers submitted for subsequent tenure reviews. The department head or other appropriate administrative officer should discuss the results of the second and fourth year reviews, including the dean's letter, directly with the candidate. In cases where a faculty member receives a negative fourth year review, but without notice of termination, and in other cases where it is deemed advisable, a special fifth year tenure review may be requested by the faculty member, the department head or the unit's equivalent administrative officer, campus chancellor, or dean of the college or University Libraries. A tenure review shall take place in every instance during the sixth-year period. All reviews of faculty whose tenure is with a college at a location different from the college of residence should include consultation with the department head. The Vice President for Commonwealth Campuses has the overall responsibility to coordinate the procedural aspects of the review process for the campuses.\nRESULTS OF EVALUATIONS:\nThe general results of the evaluation should be made known to the faculty member by the appropriate academic officer, and should indicate the extent to which colleagues judge that his or her performance, in comparison with others in the profession, meets high academic standards. The evaluation should include guidance to the faculty member in ways to improve performance. A record of the general nature of the review and the date of transmission to the faculty member shall be retained by the department head, dean, or appropriate campus academic officer.\nCOMPOSITION OF UNIT REVIEW COMMITTEES:\nOnly tenured faculty should be eligible to serve on peer tenure and promotion committees, and only faculty of higher rank than the candidate should make recommendations about promotion. In unusual circumstances, e.g., insufficient numbers of tenured and higher-ranked faculty, exceptions to this provision may be permitted by the Executive Vice President and Provost on request by the academic unit.\nPromotion and tenure committees shall consist of members of the faculty selected by procedures approved by the unit's faculty, the campus chancellor (if applicable), and the dean. Only tenured and tenure-line faculty are eligible to vote for members of all promotion and tenure committees. The faculty of the unit concerned should determine the size of the review committee, but in no case should a review committee consist of fewer than three members.\nIn order to ensure continuity in the review process, the procedures shall provide that some members of the review committee at each level shall, where possible, serve for at least two years. When terms of specified length are used, the terms of committee members should be staggered.\nCOMPOSITION OF UNIVERSITY PROMOTION AND TENURE REVIEW COMMITTEE:\nThe University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee shall consist of eleven members. Seven of these members shall be elected by the Senate from a slate of nominees prepared by the Committee on Committees and Rules with provisions for nominations from the Senate floor. The election procedures as devised by the Senate shall be such that at least two members of the committee shall be from colleges other than University Park. The remaining four members of the committee shall be appointed by the President of the University. All tenured professors, librarians, and other faculty of equivalent rank holding full-time standing appointments are eligible for election by the Senate or for appointment by the President with the following exclusions: the President's immediate staff, the Executive Vice President and Provost's immediate staff, persons holding affiliate academic appointments, and deans.\nThe President shall appoint the chair of the committee from among the seven elected and the four appointed committee members. All members of the committee shall serve for two-year terms, staggered to provide continuity to the committee's deliberations. No person may serve more than two successive terms, and, after serving two successive terms, no person may be appointed or elected to the committee for the following two year (one-term) period.\nNo member of the committee may serve concurrently on the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure and\/or the Senate Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities.\nLEVELS OF REVIEW:\nFaculty members from the former Commonwealth Educational System who retain tenure in a University Park college will have four levels of review. Other faculty members will have three levels of review. All levels of review shall be serial.\n\u00a0\nI - University Park Colleges, Single Campus Colleges, and the University College:\nThere will be three levels of review. The first-level faculty review for faculty in University Park Colleges and Single Campus Colleges shall be conducted by a committee of tenured faculty members in the candidate's department, division, or equivalent academic unit whenever possible. The first-level faculty review for faculty in the University College shall be conducted by a committee of tenured faculty members at the candidate's campus whenever possible. This committee shall include at least two tenured faculty members from the candidate's department, division, or discipline. If too few appropriate faculty members exist at a particular campus, faculty members in the candidate's discipline from other campuses shall serve, or, if necessary, faculty members from closely related disciplines shall serve. For faculty in University Park Colleges and Single Campus Colleges, the first-level administrative review shall be conducted by the candidate's department, division, or equivalent academic unit head. For faculty at University College campuses, the first-level administrative review shall be conducted by the candidate's campus chancellor. The second-level faculty review shall be conducted by tenured faculty in the candidate's college, and the corresponding administrative review by the dean of the candidate's college.\nII - Former Commonwealth Educational System Faculty Retaining Tenure at a University Park College:\nThere will be four levels of review. The first-level faculty review shall be conducted by tenured faculty members at the candidate's campus. The first-level administrative review shall be conducted by the appropriate administrator at the candidate's campus. The second-level faculty review shall be conducted by tenured faculty members, including non-University Park faculty members, in the candidate's department or equivalent academic unit within the candidate's University Park college. The second-level administrative review shall be conducted by the candidate's corresponding academic unit head. The third-level faculty review shall be conducted by tenured faculty members in the candidate's college, including at least one non-University Park faculty member, and the corresponding administrative review by the dean of the candidate's college.\nDEPARTMENT, CAMPUS OR PROGRAM REVIEW LEVEL:\nThe department committee will normally provide the first level of evaluation for tenure and promotion using criteria appropriate to the faculty member's responsibilities. The department head, after consultation, shall forward the committee's recommendation, together with his or her own, to the appropriate dean. If either the department committee or department head (or both) has (have) a positive recommendation for tenure or promotion, the dean shall forward all such recommendations to the college or University Libraries review committee for further consideration. If both recommendations are negative and are upheld by the dean, the negative decision shall be final.\nIf the negative recommendations on tenure from both the department head and the department committee are upheld, the college or University Libraries dean shall notify the faculty member in writing (see Section IV.4); negative promotion decisions do not require such formal notification. In all cases where a candidate has professional responsibilities in more than one unit, the responsibility for the departmental level review will lie with the unit representing the candidate's home administrative area. Each unit shall provide evaluations to be included in the dossier. Specially constituted committees are not necessary to accomplish these reviews.\nIn evaluating a candidate for promotion or tenure, the department committee should seek the views of senior members of the candidate's academic unit. Furthermore, evaluations of teaching faculty for promotion and tenure shall be accompanied by documentation of student views. In many cases, evaluations by expert peers in other institutions may provide essential, helpful information.\nCOLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES REVIEW LEVEL:\nThe college or University Libraries review committee shall review departmental and\/or campus recommendations for promotion and tenure in light of college and University Libraries criteria, as well as the quality of documentation, equity, and procedural fairness, and shall forward its recommendations to the dean. The recommendations of the college or University Libraries review committee, together with those from the department or comparable unit and campus, shall be forwarded to the dean of the college or University Libraries. If the dean recommends tenure and\/or promotion, or if all reviews are positive prior to the dean's review, the dossier with accompanying documentation will be forwarded to the Office of the President for transmittal to the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee. If the decision is not to award tenure, the dean shall notify the faculty member in writing (see Section IV.4). All candidates for tenure and\/or promotion will be informed by the dean whether or not their dossiers have been forwarded to the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee. If the dean intends to make a tenure or promotion decision or recommendation different from that of the college committee's recommendation, then the dean shall meet with the college committee for consultation. The intent is to require full and candid discussion when such divergent recommendations occur.\nINTERDISCIPLINARY AND DEFENSE-RELATED RESEARCH UNITS:\nFaculty members in the University's interdisciplinary and defense-related research units who do not hold a co-funded or joint appointment in an academic department and college shall be reviewed for promotion by review committees established by their respective research units, and by the director of the research unit. Membership on these review committees need not be limited to faculty members within the research unit, or to faculty members covered by this provision. The director of the research unit shall forward the committee's recommendations, together with his or her own, to the Vice President for Research. Promotion to research associate of research assistants and senior research assistants who do not hold a co-funded or joint appointment in an academic college may be made by the directors of interdisciplinary or defense-related research units; for promotion to senior research associate or senior scientist, the Vice President for Research shall determine which candidates shall be recommended for promotion, and their names forwarded to the Executive Vice President and Provost for transmittal to the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee. These provisions do not apply to faculty members in interdisciplinary and defense-related research units on noncontinuing appointments.\nUNIVERSITY REVIEW LEVEL:\nThe University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee shall review those recommendations for promotion and tenure that have been received from the deans. The Committee shall consider peer review evaluations at the department, campus, college, and University Libraries levels, in light of University criteria, as well as the quality of documentation, equity, and procedural fairness. It shall forward its recommendations to the Executive Vice President and Provost.\nOn recommendation of the Executive Vice President and Provost, the President of the University may authorize the award of tenure or promotion in rank on behalf of the University, except that promotion to the rank of assistant professor may be made by the dean without review at the University level. Faculty members shall be notified in writing of tenure and positive promotion decisions by the President (see Section IV.13 C).\nEach dean shall also forward through the Executive Vice President and Provost to the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee a summary of the general processes followed, the number of recommendations reviewed, and a summary of instances of differences in judgment. The University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee may also request from a dean such other information about particular cases that is deemed necessary to perform its function.\nIV. GENERAL PROVISIONS\nTO WHOM TENURE PROVISIONS APPLY:\n1. Provisions for holding academic tenure apply, subject to the exceptions specified in Section IV.2, to all faculty members of The Pennsylvania State University holding full-time, regular appointments to the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, librarian, associate librarian, and assistant librarian. Academic tenure applies only to the above ranks, and tenure shall be granted only in a college or in the University Libraries.\nACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS NOT SUBJECT TO TENURE:\n2. The tenure provisions defined herein do not apply to the following academic appointments:\n\tA.\u00a0Appointments designated as Fixed-Term Multi-Year, Fixed-Term I, Fixed-Term II, or Visiting.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tB.\u00a0Appointments without remuneration (\"adjunct\" and \"clinical\" academic ranks and \"faculty associates\").\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tC.\u00a0Affiliate academic ranks.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tD.\u00a0Academic appointments in areas other than a college or the University Libraries.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tE.\u00a0Academic appointments to the ranks of lecturer, instructor, affiliate librarian, research assistant, senior lecturer, senior instructor, senior research assistant, research associate, senior research associate, and senior scientist.\nThese appointments are governed by the provisions of the appropriate University policies and by the terms specified in the Memorandum of Personal Service signed by each employee.\nLetters of offer for all fixed-term faculty should clearly outline responsibilities and expectations. Unit heads should not renew any fixed-term contract without determining first whether those expectations have been met.\nFixed-term faculty may not be promoted to a tenure-track position, although such faculty may apply for such positions when openings occur and national searches to fill them are announced.\n3.\u00a0Provisions of this policy relating to academic promotions apply to all faculty members of The Pennsylvania State University, except for those academic appointments specified in Section IV.2A and\nB. Definitions of the respective academic ranks are provided in\u00a0HR21.\nTENURE STATUS AND NOTIFICATION:\n4.\u00a0Each standing appointment of an eligible person to the full-time regular rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, librarian, associate librarian and assistant librarian shall be provisional, as defined in Section IV.5, until notification in writing of change of status is sent to the appointee by the appropriate academic officer of the University.\nFor a faculty member on a standing appointment who is serving on a provisional basis, such notification shall be made prior to the expiration of the sixth year, and shall indicate that the faculty member will have permanent tenure at the expiration of the sixth year or will be terminated at the expiration of the seventh year provisional period. When continuing faculty are awarded tenure, tenure status should be effective July 1 immediately following the decision. Those who are not awarded tenure in their sixth year will be given written notice that University employment will terminate at the end of their seventh year. In the extraordinary circumstance that a faculty member is, through inadvertence, not notified of his or her status prior to the end of the sixth year, such notice shall be given at the end of the seventh year, in accordance with the standards of notice specified in Section IV.8A (3).\nFailure to notify the faculty member of his or her status prior to the end of the seventh year shall result in an automatic grant of tenure.\nA faculty member who is awarded tenure shall thereafter be terminated only for adequate cause or under circumstances described in Section IV.10. The traditional privilege of academic freedom applies equally to all faculty members regardless of tenure status.\nPROVISIONAL OR PRE-TENURE PERIOD:\n5.\u00a0The provisional appointment period in the University shall be seven years. However, up to and including the equivalent of three years of professional service at other accredited institutions of higher learning, or in an earlier appointment at The Pennsylvania State University, may be applied toward this seven year provisional period. (See also\u00a0HRG17)\nCredit toward tenure for previous service at another university should be granted only after careful consideration and should not exceed three years. More years of credit toward tenure may be granted in extraordinary cases.\nA faculty member who is promoted to the rank of assistant professor or assistant librarian (or above) may, with his or her concurrence, and at the discretion of the appropriate administrative officer, be given up to four years maximum provisional status credit for time spent as an instructor or assistant librarian at this University.\nWith regard to promotion, decisions to promote should be based on performance and scholarly achievement in the light of the general criteria (see Section II) rather than by time in rank.\nAn initial appointment at the rank of associate professor or professor may be made with grant of tenure, with the approval of the Executive Vice President and Provost and the President of the University in accord with University guidelines that prescribe immediate tenure reviews.\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the provisional period of a faculty member may be less than seven years, subject to the concurrence of the Executive Vice President and Provost and the President. University guidelines are in place that describe procedures for nominating candidates for review for early tenure.\nEQUIVALENCE OF RANK AND POSITIONS:\n6.\u00a0Librarian, Associate Librarian, and Assistant Librarian: appointments to these positions correspond to other faculty appointments concerning promotion and grant of tenure as follows - the rank of librarian corresponds to professor, associate librarian to associate professor, assistant librarian to the rank of assistant professor, and affiliate librarian to the rank of instructor.\nSenior Scientist, Senior Research Associate, Research Associate, Senior Research Assistant, and Research Assistant: appointments to these positions correspond to faculty appointments concerning promotion as follows - the rank of senior scientist corresponds to professor, the rank of senior research associate corresponds to associate professor, the rank of research associate corresponds to assistant professor, the rank of senior research assistant corresponds to senior lecturer, and the rank of research assistant to instructor.\nCOMPUTING YEAR OF CREDIT TOWARD TENURE:\n7.\u00a0In order to facilitate the administration of tenure review procedures, the following apply:\n\tA.\u00a0Anniversary Date\n\t\tThere shall be a common tenure anniversary date of July 1 for all tenure eligible academic appointments. This tenure anniversary date will not necessarily coincide with the faculty member's date of initial appointment. A year of credit toward tenure is earned in any year in which a tenure-eligible faculty member has full-time active employment status for at least six months between July 1 and June 30. Since the purpose of the provisional period is to provide an opportunity for observing the faculty member, the time spent on leave of absence will not be considered as part of the provisional period.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tB.\u00a0Staying of the Provisional Tenure Period\n\t\tUpon the written request of a faculty member, the Executive Vice President and Provost may grant a temporary staying of the tenure provisional period, if in his\/her judgment, the academic performance of the provisional faculty member would be adversely affected by: the responsibility as primary care giver after the birth or adoption of a child, the placement of a foster child in the home, a serious personal illness, the provision of care for a seriously ill family member, or any similar situation.\n\t\tFaculty are eligible to stop the tenure clock for one year for each occurrence during the period leading up to tenure, for a maximum total of two years. During this period the faculty member would not be evaluated according to the tenure guidelines, and the year would not be counted toward the provisional period.\n\t\tWhen promotion and tenure committees are being charged, the statement below should be included as part of the charge. Also, the dean must include this statement in his or her letter when soliciting evaluations from external reviewers.\n\t\t\u201cThe time period for achieving tenure and promotion to associate professor can vary, including one or more extensions of the tenure clock. A faculty member who stops the tenure clock must be evaluated according to the number of years on the tenure clock, not the number of years since being hired. The faculty member should not be held to a standard higher than the one he\/she would have had to meet if the tenure decision had been made in the year it was originally scheduled.\u201d\n\t\tThis staying of the tenure provisional period is not necessarily linked to a leave of absence with or without salary.\n\t\tAt the end of the stayed year the faculty member would continue on the tenure track.\nNOTICE OF NON-REAPPOINTMENT AND TERMINATION:\n8.\u00a0Standards for notice of non-reappointment for tenure-eligible positions are as follows:\nA.\u00a0Dates\nFaculty members who will not be continued in tenure-eligible positions shall be notified in writing. Notification must come no later than March 1 of the first academic year of tenure eligibility if termination is to occur by June 30 of that year. Thereafter, notification must come at least 12 months before June 30 of the following academic year.\nB.\u00a0Transmittal of Notice\nIn case of negative decisions at the University level, the Executive Vice President and Provost shall inform the appropriate dean or deans informally regarding the reasons for the negative judgment. These reasons shall, if requested by the faculty member, be conveyed to him or her informally by the appropriate dean or department chairman.\nIn cases of negative recommendations at the college level, the dean, department head, or campus executive officer shall convey the reasons to the faculty member informally, if requested to do so by the faculty member. The objective for both of these procedures is to assure that ultimately the faculty member may be informed in private by his or her dean and\/or department head as to why tenure was denied and at what stage of the review process. Likewise, the relevant college, department, and campus review committees shall be informed in private, if they so request, by the appropriate administrator as to the reasons for tenure denial and the level of tenure denial.\nSTANDING JOINT COMMITTEE ON TENURE:\n9. In the event that a tenured faculty member may be dismissed for adequate cause, or if a tenure-eligible faculty member is released during the provisional appointment period with less advance notice than that specified in Section IV.8 (\"out of time\" dismissal), the faculty member shall be afforded due process, as required by applicable law, and an opportunity for a hearing before the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure, prior to termination. Cases of substantive dispute involving the termination of a tenured appointment for reasons of financial exigency or program elimination or revision as specified in Section IV.10, also shall be considered at a hearing by the Committee. The operating procedures for all cases considered by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure are set forth in\u00a0HR-70.\nThe Standing Joint Committee on Tenure will act in an advisory capacity to the President, who shall be the final decision-maker in all cases considered by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure.\nFINANCIAL EXIGENCY AND PROGRAM ELIMINATION OR REVISION:\n10. A tenured or tenure eligible appointment may be terminated for demonstrated financial exigency and the affected faculty member may seek review of this termination by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure under the \"Committee Procedural Rules\" described in\u00a0HR-70. Termination of a continuous appointment because of financial exigency should be demonstrably\u00a0bona fide. If a tenured appointment is terminated because of financial exigency, the released faculty member's place shall not be filled by a new appointee within a period of three years from the date of actual termination unless the released faculty member first has been offered and has not accepted the reappointment.\nA tenured or tenure eligible appointment may also be terminated on the basis of program elimination or revision. Elimination on this ground may be effected only in the most extreme cases where the University demonstrates that for compelling reasons and after due academic consideration, including consultation with an appropriate Faculty Senate body, elimination or substantial revision of the program in which the faculty member's normal range of duties falls is necessary. Careful advance program and academic personnel planning, with phased adjustments over time, should operate to limit the necessity of terminating a tenured appointment. In the case of program elimination or substantial revision affecting a tenured faculty member's appointment, a good faith effort shall be made to continue the faculty member concerned in a comparable capacity with the University in any of its campuses based upon the individual's competencies and the capabilities of the University.\nA tenured faculty member terminated for reasons of program elimination or revision shall receive one year's notification prior to the date of the impending termination and may seek review of this termination by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure under the \"Committee Procedural Rules\" described in\u00a0HR-70. If a tenured appointment is terminated because of elimination or substantial revision, the released faculty member's position shall not be filled by a new appointee within a period of three years from the date of actual termination unless the released faculty member first has been offered and has not accepted reappointment.\nADEQUATE CAUSE:\n11.\u00a0A tenured faculty member may be dismissed for adequate cause (see Section IV.9). Similarly, when adequate cause exists, a tenure-eligible faculty member may be terminated without adherence to the standards of notice specified in Section IV.8. Adequate cause shall mean lack of competence or failure to perform in relation to the functions required by the appointment, excessive absenteeism, moral turpitude, or grave misconduct. Dismissal will not be used to restrain or otherwise affect faculty members in the exercise of their individual or collective academic freedom or in contravention of other legal rights. Standards of notice as specified in Section IV.8 are not required in cases of dismissal for adequate cause.\nADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL:\n12.\u00a0Administrative personnel who hold academic rank may qualify for academic promotion and tenure by virtue of their academic merit and promise, according to the criteria of the University and the appropriate academic unit. Tenure applies only to the faculty appointment and not to the administrative position. Appointment to affiliate academic ranks outside of the tenure system may also be appropriate (see Section IV.2).\nGENERAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES:\n13.\u00a0A.\u00a0The precise terms and conditions of every appointment shall be stated in the contract and be in the possession of both the University officer making the appointment and the faculty member being appointed before the appointment is consummated. Prior to appointment, all faculty members should be informed by the appropriate officer of the University's policies and the procedures concerning promotion and tenure and, at least annually, as to the faculty member's responsibility to teaching, research and\/or scholarly activity.\nB.\u00a0All tenured or tenure-eligible appointments are made in an academic college or the University Libraries. With the mutual consent of the individual and the appropriate academic officer, and subject to the concurrence of the Executive Vice President and Provost and the provisions of Section IV.10, tenured faculty members may retain their tenure upon transfer among academic units of the University. In addition, tenured appointments may be held at two or more of the academic units if the tenure conditions and procedures applicable to each are fulfilled.\nC.\u00a0Promotions to the rank of assistant professor, or the equivalent, are made by the appropriate dean of the college or University Libraries. The award of tenure and promotions to the ranks of associate professor and professor, or the equivalents, are authorized by the President of the University. Faculty members shall be notified in writing by the appropriate dean in cases of promotion to assistant professor or the equivalent, and by the President of the University in cases awarding tenure and of promotion to associate professor or professor.\nD.\u00a0At the time of appointment of a faculty member to a tenured position in the University, the appointment must be covered in the total General Fund Budget of the college or campus in which the appointment is held. In the case of an appointment to a tenure-eligible position, the appointment must be capable of being covered in the existing total General Fund Budget of the college or campus in which the appointment is held by the time the appointed faculty member is to receive tenure. Exceptions to this provision may be made by the Executive Vice President and Provost when it has been adequately demonstrated that other funding sources exist which indicate full continuing coverage of costs associated with tenure.\nEFFECTIVE DATE OF POLICY:\n14.\u00a0The effective date of this policy shall be July 1, 2005. This policy shall apply in its entirety to all full-time regular academic personnel.\nPOLICY REVIEW AND AMENDMENT:\n15.\u00a0The provisions of this policy shall be reviewed periodically by the University administration and the University Faculty Senate.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nhttp:\/\/www.psu.edu\/vpaa\/\nHR-70\u00a0Dismissal of Tenured or Tenure-Eligible Faculty Members\nREVISIONS:\nMay 17, 2017\nChange to Composition of Review Committees section title to Composition of Unit Review Committees and clarify language added regarding eligibility to vote.\nJuly 1, 2016\nComputing Year of Credit Toward Tenure, Section B.

University units seeking to fill academic administrative positions should give consideration to their respective affirmative action goals as outlined on their most current Affirmative Action Audit Report. This is particularly important for those units that historically have had significant under representation of women and\/or minorities in their staffing.\n\tb. National advertising is required on all standing academic administrative positions. Exceptions to this policy may be approved by the Executive Vice President and Provost in consultation with the Affirmative Action Officer. In such instances, however, the unit must provide equal promotional opportunity to women and minorities, documented by advertising the vacancy in the Intercom and considering fairly all applicants internal to the University. Additional efforts should be made to encourage Penn State women and minorities to apply. Exceptions will not be granted for the following positions: academic dean, campus chancellor, academic vice presidents, and the Executive Vice President and Provost.\nRESPONSIBILITY:\nThe next highest administrative office will be responsible for appointing advisory search committees.\nGUIDELINES:\nThe following general guidelines will apply:\n1. Advisory search committees will participate in the various phases of the search.\n2. The majority of faculty members on an advisory search committee will be members of the academic unit within which leadership is sought.\nIn the case of Interdisciplinary and Defense-Related Research Units, the academic unit embraces those colleges and departments in which faculty in Interdisciplinary and Defense-Related Research Units hold joint appointments. Exceptions to this guideline require that the appointing authority obtain written approval from the next higher level of administrative authority.\n\ta. Advisory search committees, whenever possible, will include women and members of minority groups. When women and minorities are not represented on a search committee, written documentation explaining the lack of representation of each group shall be included in the search file available for review.\n\tb. Advisory search committees, whenever possible, will include representation from all locations within the unit.\n3. The method of nominating faculty members to advisory search committees will be determined by procedures agreed upon by the faculty and the academic unit's academic administrator who is immediately above the position for which the search committee is formed.\n4. The list of faculty nominations for advisory search committees will not exceed twice the number of faculty members to be appointed by the appointing authority.\n5. The appointing authority will designate as chair one of the faculty members of the committee who comes from the academic unit within which leadership is sought. Exceptions to this guideline require that the appointing authority obtain written approval from the next higher level of administrative authority.\n6. Faculty members from other academic units, administrators and students will be included on advisory search committees as appropriate.\n7. The general charge to advisory search committees will be to identify qualified candidates. The appointing authority will provide specific charges as appropriate within the framework of this general charge applicable to all advisory search committees.\n\ta. Advisory search committees will report on efforts undertaken to locate women and minority applicants.\n\tb. Application deadlines should be at least 30 days from the date the vacancy is first publicized.\n8. Advisory search committees will participate in the determination of candidates to be interviewed and in the interviewing of those candidates.\n9. Prior to the final selection, advisory search committees will present their evaluations and recommendations of candidates to the appointing authority. At the request of either the committee or the appointing authority, a meeting to discuss recommendations will be held.\n10. When academic administrative positions are to be filled by internal processes, the following special guidelines apply:\n\ta. Advertising: position announcements should be placed in the Penn State Newswire and should be posted in the unit having the vacancy. The application deadline should be at least 30 days from its appearance in the Penn State Newswire.\n\tb. Promotions provide upward mobility for qualified current employees. As long as consideration is given to all qualified employees including women, minorities, handicapped persons, and veterans, if any, promotions will not conflict with equitable, affirmative employment practices.\n\tc. When an appointing authority utilizes the internal search method, a preappointment report will be provided to the Affirmative Action Office with the following information:\nCopy of position description.\nResume of selected employee.\nResumes of other employees who were considered for promotion.\nReason for selection of proposed employee.\nAffirmative action efforts made or considered.\n\td. At the discretion of the appointing authority, an advisory search committee may or may not be appointed for internal promotions. If an advisory search committee is not used, the form of faculty consultation to be used must be specified in the internal request for approval to use internal search processes. Faculty consultation will include matters noted in the guidelines numbered 2, 7, 8, and 9.\n\te. No employee may be transferred (or promoted) from a Fixed-Term Appointment (non-continuing) to a Standing Appointment (continuing) without going through an affirmative action search unless the person selected on the Fixed-Term Appointment was chosen after a formal search.\nThe above general guidelines apply in all search processes for academic administrative positions such as, but not limited to,\ndepartment head,\n\tdivision head,\n\tprogram head,\n\tacademic institute director,\n\tassistant dean,\n\tassociate dean,\n\tacademic dean,\n\tcampus chancellor,\n\tcampus director of academic affairs,\n\tacademic vice president,\n\t\u200bexecutive vice president and provost.\nIn the case of central administrative academic officers, the committee will be appointed by the President of the University with faculty membership being representative of the total University as nominated by the appropriate Senate mechanism.\nIn accord with Section 101.03 of the Rules of the Board of Trustees for Governance of the University, in selection of a President, the Board shall consult with representatives of the faculty and the student body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To state University policy concerning the search process for filling vacancies in academic administrative positions."},{"university":"psu","name":"ip01","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwnership and Management of Intellectual Property (Formerly RA11 - Patents and Copyrights [Intellectual Property]) | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesOwnership and Management of Intellectual Property (Formerly RA11 - Patents and Copyrights [Intellectual Property]) \n\n\n\nIntellectual Property Policies\n\nIP01\nOwnership and Management of Intellectual Property (Formerly RA11 - Patents and Copyrights [Intellectual Property])\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Research>\nContents:\nPurpose\nPolicy\nResearch Intellectual Property \nInstructional and Scholarly Intellectual Property\n\nDefinition of Terms\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nPOLICY:\nResearch Intellectual Property -\nThe protection of research intellectual property with commercial potential is an essential aspect of the technology transfer process. Rights to research intellectual property conceived, reduced-to-practice or created by University employees with the use of University facilities or resources, or in the field of expertise and\/or within the scope of responsibilities covered by employees\u2019 employment\/appointment\/association with the University are governed by the Penn State Intellectual Property Agreement that assigns such rights to the University.\nAs a condition of employment, the Intellectual Property Agreement is required to be completed and signed by individuals first appointed or transferred to the following classification categories: (1a) executive, administrator, academic administrator, and academic throughout the University; (b) faculty, staff exempt, staff nonexempt, and technical service in academic or academic service units throughout the University; (2) for any existing employee in the above classification categories who has not previously signed this IPA; (3) graduate assistants\/fellows\/trainees at the time of their first appointment; and (4) undergraduate\/graduate students, postdoctoral trainees\/research associates, wage payroll employees, visiting scholars\/scientists\/students, emeritus\/retired faculty and others who may be in a position to make, conceive or reduce to practice inventions or otherwise develop technology.\nPlease Note: The requirement to have individuals identified in item 2., above, sign an intellectual property agreement arises from: (1) the University's obligations under the Federal Bayh-Dole Act to patent and effectively transfer inventions arising from Federally sponsored research results to industry for the public benefit and to grant the government a license to use such inventions for government purposes; (2) the University's compliance with contract terms under industry-sponsored research; and (3) the University's responsibility to protect the intellectual property of our faculty and students. It is not intended to restrict the free exchange of scholarly information or prohibit free and open collaborations between scholars or scientists.\nIt shall be the responsibility of the appropriate budget executive or budget administrator to ensure that the Intellectual Property Agreement is presented to, and signed by, any individual meeting the conditions specified above. Letters of offer shall contain a statement that the signing of the attached Intellectual Property Agreement is a condition of employment.\nThe signed copy of the Intellectual Property Agreement shall accompany the personnel action (\"NAPP\" in EASY) appointing or transferring an individual to a position covered by this policy. Personnel actions requiring, but not including, a signed Intellectual Property Agreement shall not be processed until the agreement has been signed.\nThe Office of the Vice President for Research manages research intellectual property through the Office of Sponsored Programs and the Office of Technology Management.\u00a0 The Office of Sponsored Programs manages all relationships with sponsors on behalf of the University and negotiates agreements with sponsors that determine how research intellectual property developed under a research project will be administered.\u00a0 The Office of Technology Management handles all the patents, copyrights, trademarks, and tangible research intellectual property issues when the University has full or partial ownership of the research intellectual property.\u00a0\u00a0 University personnel have an obligation to disclose promptly to the Office of Technology Management, through the cognizant University administrators, research intellectual property developed either with University Resources or within the fields of expertise and\/or within the scope of employment for which the University retains them.\nInstructional and Scholarly Intellectual Property -\nThe University encourages faculty, staff, and students to create scholarly and instructional intellectual property. In this context, copyright ownership of such works generally rests with the creator(s) unless their creation is directed by the University, or is subject to a sponsor's agreement that provides for a different ownership.\u00a0 University-directed works are those created at the specific direction of a University unit for the University\u2019s ownership and use.\u00a0 Instructional Intellectual Property will be deemed a University-directed work if it is created pursuant to a written agreement between the faculty member or staff member and the University unit or if the work is considered University-directed by the standing policy of the unit.\nThe University is granted the non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use any instructional intellectual property created while the creator was a member of the University community, if that work could be reasonably construed to be related to the scope of the University employment. \u00a0In cases of University-directed works, the creators of instructional intellectual property will be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use the materials for their own limited purposes outside of the University.\u00a0 Rights of members of the University community to create and use scholarly and instructional intellectual property are subject to University policies on consulting activity and other activities external to the University, as well as to any unique contractual obligations related to the production of scholarly or instructional materials.\nUniversity personnel who enter into publishing contracts should consult with the Office of Technology Management to ensure that the contract does not conflict with elements of this policy or should obtain an explicit written exemption from the cognizant University administrator if the publishing contract might conflict. In particular, personnel are encouraged to reserve in those contracts the right to use the associated material freely for their own classroom instructional purposes. Creators of instructional intellectual property may consider obtaining a Creative Commons license and can contact the Office of Technology Management, through the cognizant University administrators, for assistance.\nUniversity personnel are expected to assist other members of the University community in fulfilling the University\u2019s educational mission.\u00a0 This includes sharing of instructional intellectual property within the University for internal instructional usage, understanding that developers and users of instructional intellectual property are expected to use the material ethically and to give appropriate credit to all source material and coauthors.\u00a0 Usage of instructional intellectual property by University employees should be accompanied by appropriate attribution of the source of the instructional intellectual property, and the original creator(s) should be consulted regarding the appropriate attribution and usage when possible.\u00a0 The original creator(s) should also be given the option not to be listed as a source of the material if they prefer not to be associated with its subsequent usage. \u00a0Any questions regarding the appropriate attribution of authorship should be referred to the cognizant University administrator.\u00a0 Faculty members who dispute the cognizant University administrator\u2019s decision regarding attribution may seek a review by the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee of the University Faculty Senate in cooperation with the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.\nIntellectual property that spans one of the boundaries between research, scholarly, and instructional as defined in this policy should be considered on a case-by-case basis by the cognizant University administrator.\u00a0 Faculty members who dispute the cognizant University administrator\u2019s decision may seek a review by the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee of the University Faculty Senate in cooperation with the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.\u00a0 In cases that involve research intellectual property, final authority rests with the Vice President for Research.\nDEFINITION OF TERMS:\n\tCognizant University administrator\n\tincludes deans, department heads, program and center directors, office directors, or other individuals delegated by the budget executive to administer such matters.\n\tInstructional intellectual property\n\tis the term used to describe materials produced for instruction in any format, including (but not restricted to) print materials, video recordings, audio recordings, and digital materials.\n\tResearch intellectual property\n\tis the term used to describe the discoveries, inventions and creations with potential commercial value that result from research activities.\u00a0 Most research intellectual property developed at the University can be protected by patents, but some University research intellectual property (i.e. software) is more appropriately protected by copyright.\u00a0 Although some research intellectual property may be protected by trademark or trade secret, it is rare for the University to utilize these methods of protection.\n\tScholarly intellectual property\n\tis the term used to describe materials resulting from scholarly, literary, and artistic work such as journal papers, books, essays, poems, paintings, sculpture, musical scores, etc. in any format, including (but not restricted to) print materials, video recordings, audio recordings, and digital materials.\n\tTechnology transfer\n\tis the process by which inventive, creative and scholarly works may be put to public use and\/or commercial application.\n\tUniversity Resources\n\tis the term used to define any support administered by or through the University, including but not limited to funds, facilities, equipment or personnel.\u00a0 The term also includes funds, facilities, equipment, or personnel that are provided through funding from governmental, commercial, industrial, or other public or private sources and administered by the University.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nIP02 - Co-authorship of Scholarly Reports, Papers and Publications\nIP03 - Courseware\nEffective Date: January 7, 2013\n\tDate Approved: September 14, 2012\n\tDate Published: January 7, 2013 (Editorial changes- November 19, 2015)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 19, 2015 - Editorial changes.

Off-Campus Rates\nExceptions to Recovering Full F&A\nRequesting Waivers of F&A\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nDEFINITION:\nFacilities and administrative (F&A) costs (also referred to as indirect costs or overhead) are those expenses that are essential to the conduct of sponsored awards but which cannot be readily attributed and directly charged to specific individual projects without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. (See Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.56.) F&A costs include such items as:\u00a0\nDepartmental administrative costs in support of research, such as administrative and technology support staff\nCosts of supplies and general use equipment (e.g., copiers, telephones, printers and related supplies)\nCentral administrative services (e.g. accounting, human resources, purchasing, security, environmental health and safety), custodial services, building and grounds maintenance.\nCapital expenses associated with laboratory and office space, classrooms and other facilities\nUtilities\nLibrary services\nSponsored program administrative services (e.g. research administration, research protections)\nNEGOTIATING RATES:\nF&A cost rates are determined periodically from actual cost records through a detailed accounting procedure specified by federal cost principles (Uniform Guidance\u00a02 CFR 200, Appendix III). \u00a0These rates are developed by the Corporate Controller's Office and audited and approved by the federal government. Separate F&A cost rates are calculated for research and instruction, and on- and off-campus sponsored activities. More rate detail\u00a0including rate summaries.\nIn accordance with federal regulations, the rates are expressed as a percentage of modified total direct costs (MTDC) expended, where per\u00a0Uniform Guidance 2 CFR\u00a0200.68:\n\"MTDC means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and subawards and subcontracts up to the first $25,000 of each subaward or subcontract (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards and subcontracts under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward and subcontract in excess of $25,000. Other items may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs, and with the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.\"\nFor more detail, see negotiated rate agreement link:\u00a0http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/osp\/documents\/rates\/FA-Current.\nPer the\u00a0Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.414(c):\n(1) The negotiated rates must be accepted by all Federal awarding agencies. A Federal awarding agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by a Federal awarding agency head or delegate based on documented justification as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.\n\t(2) The Federal awarding agency head or delegate must notify OMB of any approved deviations.\n\t(3) The Federal awarding agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.\n\t(4) As required under \u00a7200.203 Notices of funding opportunities, the Federal awarding agency must include in the notice of funding opportunity the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement, matching, or cost share as approved under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. As appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into Federal awarding agency outreach activities with non-Federal entities prior to the posting of a notice of funding opportunity.\nCertain costs are not permitted to be incorporated into the F&A cost calculation. \u00a0University Guideline FNG05 \u2013 Expenditure Guidelines for Costs Not Allowable under Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200, provides detailed information on these costs and the procedure for excluding them from the indirect cost pool.\nDETERMINING APPLICABLE RATES:\nThe principles defined in the Uniform Guidance are used to determine the applicable F&A rates for both federal and non-federal projects:\n\"Federal agencies must use the negotiated rates . . . in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the Federal award . . . \"Life\" for the purpose of this subsection means each competitive segment of a project. A competitive segment is a period of years approved by the Federal awarding agency at the time of the Federal award. If negotiated rate agreements do not extend through the life of the Federal award at the time of the initial award, then the negotiated rate for the last year of the Federal award must be extended through the life of Federal award \"(Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200, Appendix III, Part C.7).\"\n\"Time of Initial Award\"\u00a0is defined as the effective date of the agreement, rather than the execution date since agreements can be signed by both parties well before or after the effective date of the agreement. If pre-award costs are authorized which cut across the first day of a fiscal year, indirect cost charges will reflect the rates in effect at the time of the expense.\n\"Life of the Federal Award\"\nIf the federal agency has committed to a multi-year award and has provided the allocations and\/or estimates for the individual out-years,\u00a0then the rates should be fixed for the life of the agreement (generally, but not always, NSF, NIH, DOD).\nIf the federal agency has committed to a multi-year award but only provides funding for the first year and then requests a proposal for the second year,\u00a0then only the first year should have the rates fixed. When the second year funding comes in, the rates will be fixed again at the time of the second year award (generally, but not always, NASA and EPA). Any request for proposal beyond what has been defined as the period of performance will result in a proposal that will contain the new rates.\nIf submitting a proposal for a supplement to an existing award that does not extend the period of performance and the existing award has fixed rates for the life of the agreement,\u00a0then the proposal for the supplement should contain the rates established for the life of the agreement.\nON-CAMPUS VS. OFF-CAMPUS RATES:\n\"Off-campus project\" means research\/instruction conducted at a research\/instruction site or facility not owned or centrally leased by the University.\nThe investigator should develop the budget according to where the anticipated costs will be expended, on-campus or off-campus. \u00a0In allocating the anticipated costs, the investigator shall distribute the portion of direct salary and wages (including any cost sharing) that will be incurred off-campus excluding any cost to third party subcontractors. \u00a0If the salary and wages anticipated to be incurred off-campus are greater than the salary and wages to be incurred on campus, the negotiated off-campus rate shall apply to the entire project. See Q4 of the F&A FAQ for more detailed examples.\nPrincipal Investigators shall work with their assigned research coordinators in building their sponsored budgets to determine the appropriate indirect rate. \u00a0In reviewing and making the determination of the rate, the research coordinators shall review the project scope to ensure that the work truly involves costs conducted off-campus. \u00a0When a determination cannot be easily made, the Office of Sponsored Programs or the Office of Corporate Controller shall be consulted to assist in rendering a decision.\nEXCEPTIONS TO RECOVERING FULL F&A:\nSponsored awards are expected to recover full F&A costs, except as provided below.\u00a0Failure to recover F&A from a sponsor places the recovery of those costs on other revenue streams such as tuition, endowments or discretionary funds.\nThe following guidelines are used for the recovery of F&A costs:\nIf under the sponsor's published guidelines the University is required to cost share, or when an academic unit of the University proposes voluntary committed cost sharing and that cost sharing is to come from a contribution of F&A costs, the approval of the Vice President for Research (for research projects) or the Corporate Controller (for non-research projects) is necessary before submission or acceptance. (See procedures below for requesting approvals.)\nIf a sponsor is a not-for-profit or governmental [non-foreign] entity and has published guidelines (or otherwise verifiable written policy, statute, or legislation) prohibiting or limiting the recovery of F&A costs, the University may accept the lesser rate or amount, if it considers the program desirable for University participation (as evidenced by the approval of the College\/Unit on the\u00a0appropriate Internal Approval Form), without requiring central approval. The University considers the loss of F&A cost recovery, in these cases, to be usable for cost sharing when allowed by the agency. If the sponsor is foreign or for-profit, a lower F&A rate will not be accepted unless a formal waiver is approved by the Vice President for Research (for research projects) or the Corporate Controller (for non-research projects).\nIf a sponsor which is associated with a particular industry and which is financed from voluntary contributions from member companies (e.g., Electric Power Research Institute, etc.) has issued an RFP or contract prohibiting or limiting the recovery of F&A costs, the University requires the approval of the Vice President for Research (for research projects) or the Corporate Controller (for non-research projects) before submission or acceptance.\nIf a sponsor is a for-profit entity and has an established, competitive grants program open to universities, and their published guidelines prohibit or limit the recovery of F&A costs to all applicants, the University requires approval of the Vice President for Research (for research projects) or the Corporate Controller (for non-research projects) prior to submission or acceptance.\nThe University waives the recovery of F&A costs on all gifts since there is no \"deliverable\" required. The University has established RA04,\u00a0Gifts, Grants, and Contracts (The Funding Matrix),\u00a0that stipulates policy regarding the recovery of F&A on charitable grants, unrestricted grants, restricted grants, contracts, and industry membership agreements.\nOther than identified above, restrictions on F&A recovery from a for-profit company are not acceptable, except in rare circumstances (such as when the project solely funds a student's research and the student is free to publish the results) that require special review and approval by the Vice President for Research (for research projects) or the Corporate Controller (for non-research projects).\nFor Commonwealth of Pennsylvania projects, the University shall attempt to recover F&A whenever possible. The following parameters should guide budget requests:\nThe Commonwealth is required (under Pennsylvania Governor's Office Management Directive 305.21) to identify whether they are funding a specific project with federal funds, state funds, or a combination of both. If the Commonwealth funds a project with federal funds, the University should request full F&A costs at the same level as if the University were contracting directly with the federal agency involved. If the Commonwealth funds a project solely with state funds, the University will charge the amount permitted by the state agency.\nMore information can be found in the\u00a0F&A FAQ.\n\nNote:\u00a0An imposition of an overall ceiling on the total amount of award by an agency is not considered adequate justification for a waiver of F&A costs; rather, the scope of work for the project should match the funding available from the agency. Requests for waivers of full cost recovery that are the result of an agency recommending funding at a level less than proposed does not constitute adequate justification for cost sharing; rather the scope of work should be reduced to match the funds recommended for award.\nREQUESTING COST SHARING OR WAIVERS OF F&A:\nProposal solicitations in some instances call for institutional cost sharing as a condition for an award. While the University is firmly committed to assisting faculty in the pursuit of outside funding for research initiatives and program development, the resources available for cost sharing are limited. All cost sharing must be approved by an appropriate institutional official who administers the source of funds providing the cost sharing. All cost sharing must be documented in accordance with University and sponsoring agency policy.\nRequests for waivers of F&A costs or for institutional cost sharing through the use of F&A costs must be submitted in writing to the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP). Originating with the PI\/PD, such requests shall identify the Principal Investigator, the proposal title, the agency and program to which the proposal is being submitted, the total amount requested, the amount of institutional cost sharing proposed, the amount of cost sharing the academic units involved are providing, and the rationale and justification (such as sponsor's written policy) for utilizing F&A costs for cost sharing or for waiving F&A costs.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nFNG05 - Expenditure Guidelines for Costs Not Allowable Under Uniform Guidance\nRA04 - Gifts, Grants and Contracts (The Funding Matrix)\nRA50 - Cost Sharing\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published:\u00a0February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating parts of RA06, RAG06 and RAG07) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nNovember 26, 2013 - Editorial change in the POLICY section.\nMarch 19, 2013 - Editorial changes in the DEFINITIONS (F&A Costs) section, providing the correct links for F&A and MTDC, respectively.\nFebruary 24, 2010 - Minor revision in the DEFINITIONS (F&A Costs) section, changing subgrant to subaward.\nJanuary 1, 2010 - Editorial change to position titles\nNovember 8, 2006 - Editorial change to position titles\nJune 29, 2006 - Revisions made to all sections to reflect current handling\nAugust 27, 2003 - Editorial change: Under the POLICY section, guideline #2, \"College\/IRP\/Unit\" was changed to \"College\/Unit\" and \"Clearance Data Form\" was change to \"appropriate Internal Approval Form.\"\nFebruary 28, 2003 - Editorial change: form URL updated.\nOctober 11, 2001 - Removed the mention of blanket approval from the guidelines that are used for the recovery of F & A costs.\nFebruary 20, 1998 - Reformatted for GURU in February 1998 from OSP dated September 1994\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To define the appropriate Facilities and Administrative (F&A) rates to use for federal and non-federal proposals and to identify circumstances when full F&A is not assessed."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr01","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair Employment Practices | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesFair Employment Practices \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR01\nFair Employment Practices\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPurpose\nNondiscrimination\nEqual Access\nEmployee Recruiting Through Agencies or Societies\nReports on Fair Employment Practices\nCross References\n\n\nNONDISCRIMINATION:\nThe University has affirmed a policy of nondiscrimination in all of its employment programs or activities.\nEQUAL ACCESS:\nThe University is committed that all persons shall have equal access to employment without regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by University policy, contract, or state or federal authorities, and that the University does not discriminate against any person because of age as defined by law, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, genetic information, national origin, race, religious creed, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.\nEMPLOYEE RECRUITING THROUGH AGENCIES OR SOCIETIES:\nIn all solicitations to placement agencies or societies, a statement must be made indicating that all qualified applicants will receive fair and equitable consideration for employment.\nSince it is the responsibility of the Employment and Compensation Division to coordinate all help wanted advertising, that office will see that suitable statements are included in the appropriate advertisements.

The budget executive, budget administrator and Financial Officer may delegate approval authority to others as outlined in this policy, but are ultimately responsible for the proper management and oversight of the operation of the unit.\u00a0\nBudget executives, budget administrators and budget assistants are stewards of the financial accounts under their authority, and have a responsibility to assure that all financial transactions posted to these accounts are appropriate and reasonable, based on various criteria:\nThe transactions support or advance the unit\u2019s mission and goals\nThe transactions are aligned with budget priorities\nThe transactions are compliant with legal requirements and stakeholder expectations\nBudget executives, administrators and assistants are accountable for judgments and decisions made regarding expenditures on accounts for which they are responsible.\nThe Financial Officer and Financial Assistant are responsible for assuring that adequate and appropriate funds are available and that the transaction is compliant with University policy and procedure, especially to assure compliance with external laws and regulations.\nBudget executives and budget administrators retain the option of requiring that all documents, or only selected documents in addition to those required in this policy, be brought to their attention for approval. This policy specifies minimum approval requirements; setting a higher level of approval lower dollar thresholds) is permissible. Multiple documents may not be processed for the same transaction in order to avoid the dollar limits established in this policy.\nThis policy applies to all University funds (all fund types), unless otherwise specified.\nDEFINITION OF TERMS:\nBudget Executive - Those individuals who are responsible to the President, Executive Vice President and Provost, or a senior vice president for the management of an administrative area. These individuals are normally the President's administrative staff, academic Deans, and Chancellors.\nThe budget executive approves transactions at the upper dollar levels and specified categories, affirming the action meets the mission and goals of the unit and the University, demonstrates good stewardship of University resources, and that the action is appropriate within University Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures.\nBudget Administrator - Those individuals designated by the budget executive as being responsible for operating and controlling specific budget areas within the budget executive's administrative area. These individuals approve documents in their own name within the limits of the authorization policy stated below. This group normally includes associate deans, division heads, and department heads.\nThe budget administrator approves transactions at the specified dollar levels and categories, affirming the action meets the mission and goals of the unit and the University, demonstrates good stewardship of University resources, and that the action is appropriate within University Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures.\nBudget Assistant - Those individuals delegated by the budget administrator (with the concurrence of the budget executive and Financial Officer) to approve transactions in their own name for the budget administrator within the limits of the authorization policy stated below. Budget assistants are typically regular staff positions with knowledge of the unit's mission and goals and a level of judgment suitable for making decisions regarding transactions, as determined by the accountable budget administrator.\nThe budget assistant approves transactions at the specified dollar levels and categories, affirming the action meets the mission and goals of the unit and the University, demonstrates good stewardship of University resources, and that the action is appropriate within University Policies and Guidelines.\nFinancial Officer - Those individuals who represent the Corporate Controller in the various budget executive areas. This position has the responsibility of assuring that expenditures are budgetarily controlled, assets of the University are protected, and that all actions are in compliance with University Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures. The Financial Officer is also responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all documents\/actions through all financial.\nFinancial Assistant - Those individuals delegated by the Financial Officer to approve transactions in their own name for the Financial Officer within the limits of the authorization policy stated below. This position aids the Financial Officer in assuring that expenditures are controlled, assets of the University are protected, and that all actions are in compliance with University Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures. The financial assistant also ensures the accuracy of all documents\/actions through all financial systems.\nFinancial assistants are typically regular staff positions with knowledge of University policy and procedure and a level of judgment suitable for making decisions regarding transactions, as determined by the accountable Financial Officer. The individual delegated authority must have the concurrence of the Assistant Controller.\nAuthorized approver - A budget executive, budget administrator or Financial Officer.\nDesignated approver - An individual authorized to serve in the budget executive or budget administrator role with full authority for transaction approval.\nDelegated approver - Budget assistant or financial assistant.\nProxy approver - An individual authorized by a budget executive, budget administrator, or Financial Officer to approve actions (documents) when the budget executive, budget administrator, or Financial Officer is unavailable to perform their approval duties for a period of time that would be disruptive to the normal business process. The proxy may not approve actions (documents) when the budget executive, budget administrator, or Financial Officer is present.\nExpenditure document - Transactions (documents) resulting in a direct * central encumbrance or expense primarily to the allotment portion of a budget and not personnel or budgetary actions.\nBudgetary document - Transactions (documents) resulting in a direct * permanent or temporary transfer or reallocation of funds between\/among budgets, or resulting in the establishment, closing, or change to a budget\/allocation.\nPersonnel document - Transactions (documents) having a direct * affect on positions, appointments, reappointments, terminations, or an employee's gross compensation across all classes of employees, including wage payroll.\n* \"Direct\" infers that this is the final time in which the action will be brought before the required approvers to approve\/disapprove the action before the stated results become effective. Certain University documents exist that secure the preliminary approval for an action. These preliminary documents then become support documents that accompany, or are referenced by, one of the classes of documents defined in this policy. Such preliminary documents are excluded from the guidelines of this policy.\n\n\n TYPES OF APPROVAL AUTHORITY:\nAUTHORIZED APPROVALS:\nAn individual functioning as a budget executive, budget administrator or Financial Officer has inherent approval authority granted to him\/her by this policy. Documentation relating one of these functions to an actual individual is discussed under \"Documentation of Approval Authority,\" below.\nDESIGNATED APPROVALS:\nA senior administrator, Chancellor or Dean may designate another individual to approve as the budget executive for transaction approval.\u00a0 This individual must be at a higher level of authority within the unit, with knowledge of the mission and goals of the unit and a high level of integrity and judgment. \u00a0Those designated to approve as budget executives must be approved by the Corporate Controller. Designated approvers may also be established for Budget Administrators with approval from the Budget Executive and Financial Officer.\nDELEGATED APPROVALS:\nA budget administrator or Financial Officer may identify one or more individuals as a delegated approver to approve certain documents on his\/her behalf on an ongoing basis. This delegated approver shall approve paper documents by using his\/her own full name, or approve electronic documents by using his\/her own userID. Documents excluded from delegated approvals are those from categories that specifically require a budget executive's, budget administrator's or Financial Officer's personal approval (as previously listed), and certain other forms as stated on the forms themselves.\nThe individual delegated approval authority by the budget administrator is known as a budget assistant. The individual delegated approval authority by the Financial Officer is known as a financial assistant.\nNOTE: Budget assistants and financial assistants may not identify delegated approvers. In the absence of the budget assistant and financial assistant, approval reverts to the authorized approver. \n\nFinancial Officers, or the proxy approver in their absence, must personally approve all documents specifically requiring the budget executive's approval. (This may not be delegated approval.)\nPROXY APPROVAL:\nThe following authorized approvers should identify one or more individuals to approve documents by proxy in their absence from the University:\nbudget executive,\nbudget administrator,\nFinancial Officer.\nIt is recommended that these proxy designations be on-going in nature rather than issued\/rescinded each time the authorized approver is absent\/present.\nOn paper documents, the proxy approver will approve a document in his or her own full name and print the initials of the budget executive, budget administrator or Financial Officer. For IBIS documents, a proxy will be shown in an approval path by the userID of the person authorizing a proxy, followed by the userID of the person assigned  as proxy. (e.g., \"ABC1\/XYZ2\" where ABC1 is the absent budget executive, budget administrator, or Financial Officer, and XYZ2 is the authorized proxy.) Other administrative systems will reflect proxy approval as designed for that system.\nNOTE: Budget assistants and financial assistants may not identify a proxy for purposes of approving a document in their absence. However, when there are multiple delegated approvers at one level of an approval path, of which one approver is the default, the primary way the other delegated approvers can get to the forms awaiting the default is to be listed as a proxy for the default.\nSome forms do not permit proxy approvals - those forms will be identified in the signature area of the respective form.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF APPROVAL AUTHORITY:\nAn authorized approver may not assign authority to a proxy or delegated approver that goes beyond the authority specified in this policy. However, the authorized approver may choose to limit the authority of a proxy or delegated approver, or assign authority any way he\/she sees fit within the bounds of this policy. For example, a budget administrator or Financial Officer may identify two or more budget or financial assistants and have them all approve documents equally (to handle the volume of forms), or to split approvals functionally (one for general funds and one for miscellaneous funds). All assignments must be documented per the following:\nDOCUMENTATION OF APPROVAL AUTHORITY:\nWhile this policy defines the authority and responsibilities for those individuals identified as budget executive, budget administrator, Financial Officer, budget assistant, financial assistant, delegated and proxy (where permitted), it recognizes that only the term \"Financial Officer\" reflects an actual position title. The remaining identifiers exist only to delineate differing levels of authority and responsibility necessary to properly administer this policy. Therefore, the level of FN18 authority may not always be clearly derived from a person's actual position title, particularly at the lower levels of authority. While a dean usually functions as a budget executive by the inherent responsibilities of the position, the same cannot be said of individuals functioning as budget assistants, for example.\nTo provide a reasonable level of control and to satisfy any auditing requirements within the University and by external agencies, the Financial Officer must maintain evidence of approval authority of all FN18 approvers for their respective administrative area. Such evidence must identify the name of the approver, the approval function (role) to be performed (budget executive, budget administrator, budget assistant, Financial Officer, financial assistant, delegate or proxy), and the scope of the approval authority.\nBudget Executive authority must be approved by the Corporate Controller.\nBudget Administrator authority must be approved by the Budget Executive and Financial Officer.\nFinancial Officer authority must be approved by the Assistant Controller, University Financial Officers.\n\nIBIS APPROVAL PATH GUIDELINES:\nThe following requirements must be observed by Financial Officers when establishing or maintaining approval paths (mandatory approvals within IBIS:\n1) It is the responsibility of the Financial Officer to ensure that the required approvers for a particular IBIS form appear in the corresponding approval path for that form.\n2) The user-ID of the individual authorizing proxy approval or delegated approval must appear on the same level of an approval path as the proxy or delegated approvers.\n3) The Financial Officer (or his\/her delegated approver) must appear in the default column on the final level of all approval paths PRIOR to a document\/action routing to a central office.\n4) No proxy approver may appear in the default column of any path. (Refer to Electronic Approval Paths.)\n5) Because the approval paths have no symbol for permitting two or more budget assistants or financial assistants to have EQUAL approval access to the default column to process awaiting forms, the Proxy symbol \"\/\" must be used in setting up the path. The budget administrator and Financial Officer must create delegated authorization via the Authorized Approval System or through completion and approval of the Workflow ROLE form, establishing identical approval authorizations (rather than completing Proxy authorization).\n\t\t6) Approval paths may also contain additional individuals not performing any of the roles required by this policy. Typically, such individuals will appear on level 9 of departmental paths, but may appear elsewhere in the path as long as the provisions of this policy are met. These individuals perform no officially-recognized approval function and therefore require no documentation of approval authority.\n\nPOLICY:\n1. The budget executive role MUST approve:\na) all expenditure actions (documents) of $100,000 or more,\n\nb) all permanent budget actions of $100,000 or more except those Budget Amendments generated automatically through IBIS personnel actions (documents) affecting General Funds.\n\nc) all actions required by other University policies.\nNOTE: THE ABOVE BUDGET EXECUTIVE APPROVALS, EXCEPT WHERE NOTED, MAY NOT BE DELEGATED TO A LOWER LEVEL. (Budget Administrator or Budget Assistant)\n2. The budget administrator role (unless otherwise restricted by the budget executive) MUST approve and may not delegate approval of:\na) all expenditure actions (documents) from $10,000 to $99,999 inclusive,\n\nb) permanent budget actions up to $99,999, and all temporary budget actions of $10,000 or more,\n\nc) Budget Amendments generated automatically through IBIS personnel actions,\n\n d) personnel actions involving all Standing Appointments, Fixed-Term Multi-Year appointments and Fixed Term I appointments, including supplememental pay, and\n\ne) all actions required by other University policies.\nThe budget administrator role (unless otherwise restricted by the budget executive) MAY approve or delegate approval of:\na) all other expenditure, budgetary, or personnel actions not restricted above.\n3. The budget assistant role, (unless otherwise restricted by the budget administrator) may inherently approve the following actions:\na) personnel actions involving fixed term II appointments, Graduate Assistants, Post-Doctorals, and Scholars,\n\nb) expenditure and budgetary actions (documents) UNDER $10,000,\n\nc) Budget Amendment for Restricted Accounts (BARA), regardless of the dollar amount,\n\nd) Request For Cash Advances UNDER $5,000, and\ne) wage payroll transactions (\"WAPP\" and \"WAGC\").\n\nAll other approval rights must be explicitly assigned to the budget assistant by the budget administrator via the Authorized Approval System or Workflow ROLE form.\n4. The Financial Officer role must establish appropriate approval paths or approval roles in all administrative systems as determined by this policy and approve all expenditure, budgetary and personnel transactions (documents) that directly affect a budget through an encumbrance or an immediate expense that the budget executive and budget administrator are required to approve (as specified in #1 and #2 above).\na) Wage appointments (\"WAPP\"), wage terminations (\"WTER\"), and IBIS ROCRs need not be approved by the Financial Officer or financial assistant, and\n\nb) all actions required by other University policies.\n5. The financial assistant role, (unless otherwise restricted by the Financial Officer), MAY inherently approve the following:\na) Expenditure and budgetary actions (documents) UNDER $10,000 (except budget executive's travel settlements),\n\nb) Personnel actions involving Non-Standing Appointments (except Fixed-Term Multi-Year),\n\nc) Personnel actions involving nonexempt staff and technical-service Standing Appointments (i.e., overtime shift differential),\n\nd) Budget Amendment for Restricted Accounts (BARA) regardless of dollar amount, and\n\ne) Wage payroll actions (\"WAGC\").\n\nAll other approval rights must be explicitly assigned to the financial assistant by the Financial Officer via the Authorized Approval System or Workflow ROLE form.\nMISCELLANEOUS:\n6. None of the approvers specified in 1-5 are permitted to approve a document that pertains to themselves. For example, a budget administrator may not approve travel settlements for his or her own travel. In such circumstances, an approval must be obtained at the next higher level. A budget assistant would defer approval to the budget administrator; a budget administrator would defer approval to the budget executive; the budget executive would defer approval to a senior level position (generally the Corporate Controller); financial assistant would defer approval to the Financial Officer; and a Financial Officer would defer approval to the Assistant Controller.\n7. Unless an action (document) is identified as requiring only one approval, all forms must be approved by at least two different  individuals. This means that a form requiring a minimum of two approvals cannot be approved by the same individual acting in different capacities. (For example, an action cannot be approved by ABC1 as a delegated approver and by ABC1 as a proxy approver.)\n8. Rubber stamps will be permitted ONLY on duplicate or carbon copies of internal University documents. No \"Signature\" stamps or electronic duplicated signatures are permitted on original paper expenditure, budgetary, or personnel action documents. If a stamp is used, it must state that the original document was signed by the individual responsible for the specific document stamped.\n9. Digital signatures are permitted for internal University documents only, and are not permitted for personnel, budgetary or financial transactions covered by this policy.\n10.

Whether it is through advertising, media relations, brochures and direct mail, promotional videos, TV commercials, web pages, or other means, the consistent application of strategies to promote and protect the Penn State brand is of vital importance to the institution.\nThe decentralized structure of University management creates dozens of administrative areas with communications needs, often leading to conflicting and inconsistent messages about the University. Successful marketing strategies and communications efforts cannot ensue from isolated or ad hoc tactics. For the University to properly communicate with a consistent voice, it is essential that the communications activities of Penn State be coordinated through one central office.\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of the Pennsylvania State University that the development and application of marketing and communications strategies across the breadth of the University rest with the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications.\nThe Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications is charged with oversight for the development of marketing and communications strategies, and for coordinating the external communications activities of the entire University. No marketing consultants, marketing research firms, social media consultants, advertising agencies or graphic design firms may be hired without the prior approval from the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications.\nAll external communications activities of the University will be coordinated through, and approved by, the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications. These activities will include, but not be limited to:\nPublications (including print and \"digital\");\nLogos and unit identity (see section below and AD07);\nAdvertising (See AD08) (Including traditional media channels such as TV, radio, billboards, magazine, newspaper, etc., as well as marketing communications that utilize new media channels, such as web sites, email solicitations, product placement, and other activities involved in marketing the University);\nGeneral Media Relations (distribution of press releases, development of external newswires, faculty expert data bases, and all other activities related to media relations);\nPromotional Videos (see AD25);\nFirst Level Web Pages (see AD54);\nEmergency Communications;\nMarket Research; and\nSocial Media (see section below).\nSTAFFING\nThe hiring of staff responsible for marketing, communications or media relations will be done in consultation with the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications. The Vice President for Strategic Communications, or his\/her designee, will participate in the interview of the final candidates for such positions.\nLOGOS AND UNIT IDENTITY\nIndividual unit logos generally are not permitted. Exceptions and special needs for unit identities will be handled through the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications. No logos, word marks, or identity symbols incorporating the name of the unit or University may be developed without prior approval from the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications.\nInformation about the University\u2019s institutional graphic identity system, and guidelines for using the University mark, is available at\u00a0http:\/\/visualidentity.psu.edu. Guidelines for using the Intercollegiate Athletics logo and other symbols, is available at:\u00a0http:\/\/visualeditorialstandards.psu.edu\/graphic-identity-system\/intercol...\nUNIVERSITY STATIONERY\nUniversity stationery, including letterhead, envelopes, and business cards will conform to the standard designs and formats provided through the University\u2019s Multimedia and Print Center.

In order to accomplish this, Penn State and its campuses, colleges, and departments have official social media accounts, including but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Linked-In, blogs, etc., These accounts are only to be used for the purpose of communicating and promoting an individual college, campus or unit as well as the University at large, and are under the jurisdiction of the University. As such, they are subject to all applicable University policies. Misuse of official social media accounts by an employee, including posting racist, sexist or other discriminatory posts, can lead to disciplinary action.\nEmployees may not use University accounts as their own personal accounts. Employees\u2019 personal social media accounts may not give the appearance of officially representing the University or an individual college, campus or unit. Permission to use any Penn State logo or trademark on a personal or non-University account must be obtained from the Office of Licensing Programs. Further information on use of University services and equipment for personal social media accounts can be found in Policy FN14.\nThe Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications will monitor and assist in coordinating the use of social media by all University units. Guidelines for the use of social media are available that discuss best practices to use these forums effectively, protect the University\u2019s reputation, enhance the University\u2019s image, and help units and staff follow University policies.\nCOUNCILS AND COMMITTEES\nTo facilitate the integration of marketing activities across the University, the University Marketing Council will include representatives from Intercollegiate Athletics, Enrollment Management, Outreach, the Alumni Association, Hershey Medical Center, University Development, Information Technology Services, Public Broadcasting, a campus location, and an academic college.

For example, this Policy does not apply to various operational procedures or forms to inform faculty, staff and students how to proceed with respect to various administrative processes such as admissions, registration, benefits, health, safety, research compliance, information technology, risk management and the like. As a further example, this Policy does not apply to Administrative Policies and Procedures.\nThis Policy does not apply to governance documents such as the Bylaws and Standing Orders of the Trustees.\nThis Policy does not apply to the policies and procedures of the University Faculty Senate.\nIn deciding whether a particular policy or procedure is a University Policy that must be reviewed and adopted as required here, individuals may consult with the Office of the Vice President and General Counsel or the Vice President for Administration.\nRESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL:\nA Responsible Official includes the President, members of the President\u2019s Council, and an employee specifically delegated by such individuals to develop a University Policy.\nDEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW OF A UNIVERSITY POLICY:\nA University Policy may be initiated by a Responsible Official with authority and responsibility for the subject area addressed. The Responsible Official should oversee the drafting and development process and may designate and authorize others to assist. Responsible Officials should also periodically review and update policies to ensure compliance with best practices, laws and regulations and seek approval of any material changes. In developing or amending a University Policy, the Responsible Official should confer with others in the University who may be significantly affected by the Policy or who have relevant expertise in the subject matter. Responsible Officials may consult with the Office of the Vice President and General Counsel at any stage in the development process and in interpreting Policies that have been adopted.\nAPPROVAL:\nThe approval process stated here applies to adoption of new University Policies and significant amendments to existing University Policies.\nThe approval processes for University Policies that are posted on Penn State Policies are as stated in the \"Introduction\" of each Section on the policies website. To the extent not stated there, and except for Administrative Policies, the Responsible Official for the subject matter addressed by the Policy has the authority to approve the Policy.

The Research Quality Assurance Program is located at the College of Medicine campus and audits human subject research conducted at the College of Medicine and the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and its satellite locations.\u00a0 The RQ programs do not audit research conducted at the Pennsylvania College of Technology.\u00a0\nREGULATORY AGENCIES:\nHuman participant research is regulated by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and\/or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the RQ programs take their direction from these governmental authorities through the Institutional Review Board (IRB).\u00a0 Regulations related to audit or the review of research in 45 CFR 46 (Code of Federal Regulations. Title 45A- Department of Health and Human Services; Part 46 \u2013 Protection of Human Subjects) and 21 CFR 56 (Code of Federal Regulations. Title 21, Chapter 1 \u2013 Food and Drug Administration, DHHS; Part 56 \u2013 Institutional Review Board) are \"currently interpreted as granting the institution, the IRB, and\/or its representative(s) the authority and responsibility to audit research\" to ensure the safety of participants. (Bankert, EA & Amdur, RJ.\u00a0 2006. Institutional Review Board, Management and Function, p. 53)\nAUTHORITY OF RESEARCH QUALITY PROGRAMS:\nRQ programs have the authority and are mandated by the Organizational Officials to conduct reviews of human participant research and other activities, to include, but not limited to:\nRoutine and directed reviews prior to IRB approval (for FDA-regulated research) or following IRB approval\nOngoing reviews throughout the course of FDA-regulated research conducted by a sponsor-investigator (a\u00a0sponsor-investigator is a person who both initiates and conducts an FDA-regulated study; that is, an individual who (i) holds an IND or IDE; and (ii) serves as the principal investigator in one or more studies conducted under that IND or IDE).\u00a0\nRequire the investigator to provide written documentation from the FDA for Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption determinations.\u00a0\nObservation of the consent process\nObservation of the conduct of research\nReview of all research-related documentation\u00a0\nReview of facilities and research personnel regarding suitability and preparedness to conduct research, especially research that is FDA-regulated.\nAt the College of Medicine, with some limited exceptions, only a licensed physician may be an Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) holder.\nAt all campuses and colleges except the College of Medicine, the ability of an investigator to serve as an IND\/IDE holder is evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\nOversee compliance with clinicaltrials.gov registration and reporting.\u00a0\nThe RQ program staff provides the results of all reviews to the IRB, including any recommendations for corrective actions.\u00a0 The Organizational Officials, as appropriate, are provided with the results of reviews.\nINVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES (as they relate to this policy):\nGeneral responsibilities as they relate to quality research (see Policy RP03).\nCooperate with RQ program staff as they carry out their responsibilities.\nContact the RQ program staff for guidance as needed.\nAdditional responsibilities for sponsor-investigators conducting FDA-regulated research:\nContact the RQ program for assistance in determining if you are a sponsor-investigator.\nContact the RQ program staff for assistance in determining whether an IND\/IDE is needed.\nContact the RQ program prior to FDA submission of an IND\/IDE application.\nContact the RQ program \u00a0prior to the time of submission to the IRB of a new study that will be FDA regulated.\nWork with the RQ program staff to arrange a review to gather information regarding research personnel qualifications and site suitability for the proposed research.\nMeet with the RQ program staff to discuss responsibilities as a sponsor-investigator prior to IRB approval.\nProvide any follow-up information requested by the RQ program staff.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nRP03 -

To dispose of an item, it is required that the department owning the item use the preferred form for disposal, the \"Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets-\"DISP\"). In those cases where an area does not have access to the IBIS system, areas may complete and process the paper version, Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets) per the instructions in GURU.\nNOTE: For the collection of high quality\/high value furniture, partitions and office furnishings, Lion Surplus will coordinate collection efforts with the Furniture Reuse Store, as specified in \"Furniture Reuse Program,\" below.\nTRADE-IN OF TAGGED EQUIPMENT:\nDepartments have the privilege of using their tagged equipment as a trade-in when new equipment is purchased. However, Property Inventory must be notified so that University records are properly updated. This process must occur via departmental completion of the \"Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets-\"DISP\"). In those cases where an area does not have access to the IBIS system, areas may complete and process the paper version, Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets) per the instructions in GURU. For such transactions, the \"trade in\" field\/box must be selected.\nTRANSFERS\/SALES BETWEEN UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS:\nUniversity departments may transfer or sell certain surplus items on a direct basis between themselves. Prior to transfer or sale, a Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer of Tangible Assets form must be completed and forwarded to Property Inventory to record any property originally valued at $5,000 or higher that was tagged by Property Inventory. An Interdepartmental Transfer (IBIS \"IDCC\") is used to transfer funds for those items which are eligible to be sold.\nUniversity departments may transfer office furniture, partitions and office furnishings to other departments within their college or unit at no cost. At no time can a department sell these office furnishings internally to other departments, colleges or units. Please refer to the \"Furniture Reuse Program\" (below) for the required handling and procedures.\nIn no event may any department sell or donate equipment, supplies, and\/or materials directly to any private individual or organization.\nProperty being transferred or sold between departments must receive appropriate care in its disposition, in accordance with the guidelines specified in \"Disposal of Electronic Media and Office-Generated Paper.\"\nTRANSFER OR DISPOSAL OF VEHICLES:\nWhen a University department transfers or disposes of vehicles, that department must notify the Office of Property Inventory by completing a \"Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets-\"DISP\") form. In those cases where an area does not have access to the IBIS system, areas may complete and process the paper version, Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets) per the instructions in GURU.\nTERMINATION OF VEHICLE LEASES OR LOAN AGREEMENTS:\nUpon termination of lease contracts, or when loaned vehicles are returned or transferred by a University department, that department involved must also notify the Office of Property Inventory by completing a \"Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets-\"DISP\") form. In those cases where an area does not have access to the IBIS system, areas may complete and process the paper version, Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets) per the instructions in GURU.\nPURCHASE OF ITEMS FROM LION SURPLUS BY UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS:\nUniversity departments may purchase items from Lion Surplus. The Penn State Purchasing Card is the authorized and preferred method of department payment. However, an Interdepartmental Transfer (IDCC) may also be used. Regardless of the method of purchase, the Property Inventory department must be notified of such purchases so that accurate record keeping can be maintained, and PSU tag numbers can be included\/recorded.\nRegistered student organizations may also purchase items from Lion Surplus by submission of the appropriate Associated Student Activities' Purchase Order.\nThe IDCC or valid student organizations' Purchase Order must be processed within five (5) working days of the visit, or the items will be reallocated for another department. Upon receipt of the IDCC \/ student organization Purchase Order, Lion Surplus will arrange for delivery, or advise the department to make arrangements with Physical Plant Operations if the items are too large for Lion Surplus personnel to handle.\nPurchases over fifty dollars will be delivered to the department at no cost. Purchases under fifty dollars will be assessed a handling charge, or the department can arrange their own pick-up within five days of purchase. Any item not picked up within five days will be reallocated.\nSALE OF SURPLUS ITEMS BY LION SURPLUS:\nLion Surplus will dispose of surplus items at public auctions held periodically throughout the year, by sales to the public on competitive bid, or through the Sales Store. Lion Surplus also sells surplus items to other University departments. (See above and Policy FN16.)\nINCOME FROM SURPLUS ITEMS SOLD BY LION SURPLUS:\nA percentage of the net sale from obsolete or surplus equipment and\/or supplies and materials will be credited to the administrative area that transferred the equipment to Lion Surplus. Net income is the sale price less the associated costs of disposition such as advertising, handling, warehousing, etc. Departments should contact Lion Surplus as far in advance as possible when disposing of high value or unique items in order to advertise and identify the optimal market value for the item(s).\nLion Surplus will not issue credit to departments for scrap material that has been collected by Lion Surplus.\nTRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT WHEN FACULTY LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY:\nIn order to transfer equipment acquired through research funds to a different facility, in conjunction with a move by a faculty member to that facility, the following five steps are required.\nThe equipment must be available for transfer; i.e., either it belongs to the University and the terms of the grant or contract do not prohibit such transfer to another institution, OR, if the University is accountable to another party (e.g., property owned by a Federal Agency Sponsor), that agency has approved the transfer. The Cost Analysis and Property Inventory Office will work with all parties involved to insure that the proper paperwork is completed and that everything is in compliance with applicable regulations for the transfer.\nThe equipment to be transferred must be requested by the departing faculty member.\nA written request for transfer must come from the budget administrator or budget executive involved, along with the confirmation that the equipment is of no value in other teaching or research programs at the University.\nA letter is required from the recipient institution agreeing to accept title, with the understanding that the equipment is for the initial use of the new faculty member. The recipient institution must indemnify and hold harmless The Pennsylvania State University from all loss, damage, or liability arising from the said transfer.\nA Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets-\"DISP\") (or the paper version of the form if the area does not have access to IBIS) must be prepared by the department holding the equipment if the relocation is expected to last more than one year. If the relocation is expected to last from two weeks up to and including one year, then a Report of Temporary Relocation of Tangible Assets must be processed.\nAll such equipment disposition must be approved by the Vice President for Research and processed through the Office of Sponsored Programs.\nTo properly protect the interests of the University with respect to potentially sensitive information, such property must receive appropriate care in its disposition, in accordance with the guidelines specified in \"Disposal of Electronic Media and Office-Generated Paper.\"\nDISPOSAL\/TRANSFER OF GOVERNMENT OR SPONSOR-PROVIDED PROPERTY:\nGovernment or Sponsor-provided property shall not be disposed of\/transferred prior to receiving proper approval, as follows:\nPrincipal Investigators (PI) must obtain and complete a Disposition\/Transfer Request Form, available from the Cost Analysis and Property Inventory Office.\nUpon PI completion, the Disposition\/Transfer Request Form is forwarded to the appropriate department property administrator, who will add the following information:\nAgreement Number\nFund Number\nReason for request\nCondition Code for the item(s)\nReceiving Agreement\/Fund that the PI wishes to transfer the property to\n\nThe department property administrator will forward the completed Disposition\/Transfer Request Form to the Cost Analysis and Property Inventory Office.\nThe Cost Analysis and Property Inventory will submit all requests for disposition\/transfer of equipment to the government\/sponsor Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), with a copy to the appropriate contracts department.\nProperty must be disposed of\/transfered in accordance with the guidelines specified in \"Disposal of Electronic Media and Office-Generated Paper.\"\nDISPOSAL OF SCRAP ITEMS:\nTo insure proper disposal, departments having operations which result in the accumulation of scrap items are required to coordinate disposal of such items through Lion Surplus. Scrap items will subsequently be collected and accumulated by Lion Surplus. Non-precious scrap items will be picked up by a contracted scrap dealer, upon coordination and request by the Manager of Lion Surplus. Lion Surplus exchanges the services of hauling away these scraps for the value of the scraps. As market conditions dictate, the contract with the scrap dealer will be renegotiated.\nAny precious\/semi-precious metal scraps received will be accumulated separately, then made available for sale through the Lion Surplus Sales Store, or at their annual public auction.\nDISPOSAL OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA AND OFFICE-GENERATED PAPER:\nItems found to contain University proprietary or confidential data must receive appropriate care in disposition; i.e., they must be shredded, securely wiped, or rendered unreadable, as applicable. Regardless of format, all property capable of retaining data must be checked and certified by the department or area as University \u201cdata-free\u201d before they may be transferred, passed on for resale, or sent for destruction.\nData can reside on paper, electronic hard drives and other media, and may include information that is sensitive and must be kept confidential (such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), student or employee records, email, health information, etc.) This policy helps to ensure that confidential information is not accessible by someone who is not authorized to view that information. Additionally, this policy will help to mitigate the potential exposure of PII, such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs), Driver\u2019s License numbers, credit card numbers and bank account numbers, all of which are considered to have notification responsibilities if proper disposal or storage was not followed.\nUsers shall ensure that data covered by Policy AD35, University Archives and Records Management is copied and securely stored before their disks are securely erased.\nIf more stringent security requirements exist that have been established for special purpose items, such as grant-funded research data, data covered by the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) related data, those more stringent requirements shall be followed with respect to this policy. Systems located at Hershey Medical Center should refer to HMC Policy C-08 in the Hospital Administrative Manual (Disposal of Information, Sanitizing of Electronic Media, and Destruction of Hard Copy Documents).\nProcedures for Disposal:\nPaper files left in drawers of furniture or equipment that contain PII or other sensitive-related paper-based data shall be shredded using an office cross-cut shredder or sent for secure disposal using the University Blue Bag Program (http:\/\/www.libraries.psu.edu\/psul\/speccolls\/psua\/records\/inactive.html). Locations which do not have access to the University Blue Bag Program may use an approved third party company with which the University already has a contract in place for shredding.\nAny electronic device destined for Lion Surplus shall be securely erased by Lion Surplus or a 3rd party under contract with Lion Surplus. No special action is required from the sending department or end-user, unless they wish to securely erase the electronic device prior to sending to Lion Surplus. Electronic devices include but are not limited to: removable media (CDs, USB flash drives), Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), wireless email devices, mobile phones and any other hard drive capacity device not already mentioned.\nElectronic devices which are transferred to another individual inside of the department or out of a department to somewhere other than Lion Surplus, must be securely erased by the department prior to the transfer. The responsible Budget Executive shall certify the computer has been securely erased by indicating so on the Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer\/Relocation of Equipment (Tangible Assets-\"DISP\"). This includes, but is not limited to, the following:\nComputers being transferred from one department to another.\nComputers being returned directly to a vendor or other 3rd party. This includes systems being returned that had been rented, loaned, leased, or part of a trade-in program. The one exception that applies is if a contract is in place with the vendor to securely erase the data to the Penn State standard upon return of the device; then no sanitizing is required by Penn State prior to return.\nComputers being sold directly to employees for personal use unless the machine has physically gone to Lion Surplus to be securely erased and purchased.\n\nAny electronic device or media (not mentioned above) that has the capacity to store University data shall be considered to have sensitive information on it. Examples include photocopier memory, fax machine memory, lab equipment, and computer network hubs and routers. If such units are to be transferred to another department, Lion Surplus, or otherwise disposed of, the originating department should contact the manufacturer for procedures to erase the data as securely as possible. If the units\/devices are destined to be returned to the vendor, the data must be securely wiped by the department prior to return unless the vendor has a contract in place to securely wipe the data upon return.\nFURNITURE REUSE PROGRAM:\nFurniture, office furnishings and partitions that become surplus often have reuse potential. Such items can be donated within the college, department or unit at no charge. Costs for relocation of these items will be the responsibility of the receiving college, department or unit. Sales between departments, colleges or units of these items are not allowed. Surplus furniture, office furnishings and partitions should not be stored on campus unless for temporary needs or a specific short duration of time. When surplus furniture, furnishings or partitions are identified, the Coordinator for the Furniture Reuse Program must be contacted. The Coordinator will make arrangements to review the furniture to determine the reuse potential. All furniture that is donated for reuse will be removed and relocated at no cost. Any furnishings not accepted for reuse can then be transferred to Lion Surplus.\nThe Furniture Reuse Program is not available to the general public.\nFurniture Reuse Process for the University Community:\nThe Furniture Reuse Program is available for all Penn State campuses, colleges and locations. Donated furniture, office furnishings and partitions are available on a first come, first serve basis.\nSelected surplus items will be picked up and transferred free of charge to the Furniture Reuse Program site.\nThe current location for the Furniture Reuse Program is at Penn Logistics off the Benner Pike. It is open to the University Community. Interested areas may contact the Coordinator to schedule a time to tour the facility and select furnishings.\nThe only cost will be the transport of furniture, office furnishings and partitions to the new location within Penn State facilities.\nAll deliveries must be made and coordinated by the Coordinator to assure the integrity of the program.\nFurniture and other items selected for reuse by a College, Department or Unit must be delivered within two weeks of selection to the new site or it will be returned to inventory.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD35 - University Archives and Records Management\nHMC C-08 - Disposal of Information, Sanitizing of Electronic Media, and Destruction of Hard Copy Documents\nProcedure BS2011 -Lion Surplus Operation, Including Sales Store\nEffective Date: May 1, 2015\n\tDate Approved: April 30, 2015\n\tDate Published: May 1, 2015\n\u00a0\nMost Recent Changes:\nMay 1, 2015 - Changes to the PURPOSE, RESPONSIBILITY, APPLICABILITY and REPORTING INFORMATION sections to reflect current operations.

This term does not include teaching engagements at other institutions of higher education. Teaching engagements at other institutions of higher education are governed by Policy AD77 Engaging in Outside Professional Activities (Conflict of Commitment). This term also does not include outside activities outside the faculty's field of expertise. A faculty member's field of expertise shall be as defined by his\/her department head or unit head and\/or Dean or cognizant Administrative Officer.\nOutside activity:\nOutside consulting or other professional activity or service, paid or unpaid, that is beyond the scope of the individual's University employment responsibilities. Such consulting or other professional activity or service is in the general area of expertise for which the faculty member is employed by the University. Outside commitment involves the use of the employee's expertise, the practice of his or her profession, or any activity that contributes to the employee's professional competence and development.\nPOLICY:\nFaculty:\nWith prior approval, as outlined below (\"Required Prior Approval\"), a faculty member may engage in consulting up to an equivalent of four (4) days per month, for a maximum of forty (40) hours per month, during the duration of his\/her appointment period. Thus, faculty with a thirty-six (36) week appointment may consult for a maximum of forty (40) hours per month for the nine months of his\/her appointment period, but no more than 360 hours total during that nine month period; and, faculty with a forty-eight (48) week appointment may consult for a maximum of forty (40) hours per month for the twelve months of his\/her appointment period, but no more than 480 hours total during that twelve month period. Any consulting engaged in by faculty:\nShall not interfere with the performance of his\/her University duties or other contractual obligations to the University (including non-classroom and non-research responsibilities expected of all faculty members).\nShould enhance his\/her professional stature or academic proficiency;\nShall not adversely affect the University's interests or mission or violate University policies or regulations including, but not limited to, policies or regulations related to intellectual property, conflict of interest, private consulting, use of University's name or its resources, etc.; and\nShall not exceed the maximum monthly time as outlined above. In extraordinary circumstances, if faculty need to exceed the monthly limit of hours (but not exceed the total appointment limit of either 360 or 480 hours), approval of this exception must be obtained as outlined below (\"Required Prior Approval\").\nAdditionally, private consulting may create the potential for or perceptions of a conflict of interest between the faculty's financial interests created by the consulting and his\/her related Penn State research. In addition to the prior approval process necessary to engage in consulting that is outlined in this Policy, such potential or perceived conflicts may need to be disclosed and properly managed or eliminated prior to consulting, in accordance with Policy RA20, Individual Conflict of Interest.\nCertain activities are expected of a faculty member as part of his or her normal scholarly activities and are not regulated by this Policy (even if a faculty member is paid to do them by a person or entity other than the University). These include, but are not limited to:\nPresentations at professional meetings and other similar gatherings\nPeer review of articles and grant proposals\nLeadership positions in professional societies\nPreparation of scholarly publications\nEditorial services for educational or professional organizations\nService on advisory committees or evaluation panels for governmental funding agencies, nonprofit foundations, or educational organizations\nService with accreditation agencies (e.g., AAALAC, AAHRPP, etc.)\nConducting workshops for professional societies\nMusical and other creative performances and exhibitions, if there is an expectation in the faculty member's discipline that he\/she will engage in such performances or exhibitions\nStaff:\nThis Policy does not apply to consulting by staff. Staff must follow all University Human Resource policies concerning time worked and time reporting applicable to staff. Permission to engage in consulting by staff and how those hours are accounted for is at the discretion of his\/her supervisor and not subject to this Policy.\nGraduate Students and Post-Doctoral Scholars or Fellows:\nThis Policy does not apply to consulting by graduate students and post-doctoral scholars or fellows. Consulting by these individuals is at the discretion of his\/her supervisor or academic program and must comply with all applicable University policies related to his\/her University employment or contractual agreement.\nREQUIRED PRIOR APPROVAL:\nA faculty member must request and obtain prior written approval from his\/her department head or unit head prior to engaging in private consulting. (For consulting that occurs entirely outside the faculty members' academic appointment period, prior approval is not required. However, all other provisions of this Policy (e.g. Use of Facilities and Resources, Involvement of Students) and all other University policies will still apply.) Such requests are made by completing the Consulting Approval Form and submitting the completed Form to the appropriate department head or unit head. Department heads and unit heads shall review all Consulting Approval Forms submitted for approval to ensure the proposed consulting does not violate this Policy and is appropriate in relation to the performance of the faculty member's regular University duties. Department heads and unit heads may request and require additional information or clarification from the faculty member regarding the proposed consulting if such information or clarification is deemed necessary in order to make a decision to approve or disapprove the consulting request. A written decision regarding the proposed consulting will be recorded on the submitted Consulting Approval Form and the original Form shall be maintained by the department\/unit head and a copy shall be returned to the faculty member.\nIf the request to engage in consulting exceeds the monthly consulting time limits set forth above in this Policy (see \"Policy\" above), then the proposed consulting and Consulting Approval Form must be approved by both the relevant department\/unit head and dean's office or next highest level of authority.\nCompleted Consulting Approval Forms shall be maintained by department\/unit heads for a period of three (3) years from the conclusion of the consulting relationship.\nA faculty member may not provide special service to the Commonwealth for additional compensation without prior written approval of the President of the University. Please see Policy HR42 Payment of Personal Compensation by a State Agency or Department of the Commonwealth for more information on this topic.\nREQUIRED REPORTING:\nReports shall be submitted annually by department heads and chancellors to their deans or vice presidents, who shall in turn submit a summary report to the Provost, concerning the levels and amount of private consulting by those faculty and staff within their administrative authority. The reports shall not identify individuals by name.\nReports from department heads and chancellors to their deans or vice presidents are due by June 1. Summary reports from those officials to the Provost are due by July 1. External Consulting Summary forms for department head use, and Consulting Summary Report forms for submittal to the Provost, are available.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR PRIVATE CONSULTING SERVICES:\nThe University assumes no responsibility for private consulting services performed by members of its faculty. The name of the University is not in any way to be connected with the service rendered or the results obtained. The faculty member must make it clear that his or her consulting work is a personal matter. A faculty member shall not accept or retain employment which would bring him or her as an expert or in any other capacity, into conflict or in competition with the interests and purposes of the University or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and federal agencies.\nPlease see Appendix A for important information regarding intellectual property issues that can arise in consulting and for recommendations regarding these, and other related, issues.\nUSE OF UNIVERSITY FACILITIES AND RESOURCES:\nPolicy FN14 Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services prohibits the use of University facilities and resources including specialized equipment, specialized software, supplies and services for faculty consulting activities. Faculty consultants may access University facilities for consulting in the same manner available to non-University personnel. The utilization of University resources for consulting purposes must be approved by University administrators and documented in a Facility Use Agreement. The Facility Use Agreement clearly identifies the extent and nature of the facilities being utilized and establishes use charges based on the cost to the University of maintaining said facilities. The financial officer of the College or administrative unit should establish the appropriate charge out rate. Faculty consultants may utilize standard office facilities, including internet, local telephone, University-provided computers, etc., if reasonable and if the University incurs no additional incremental cost for said personal use. No administrative approval or Facility Use Agreement is needed for the use of standard office facilities as described above.\nINVOLVEMENT OF STUDENTS AND STAFF:\nThe involvement of students and staff in faculty consulting activities should be undertaken with caution. Faculty cannot involve students or staff in consulting activities within the scope of the student's or staff member's University duties. Faculty may hire students or staff to assist with faculty consulting activities outside the scope of the student's or staff member's University duties. Such arrangements require the full knowledge and prior approval of the faculty's department head or unit head and the student's faculty advisor or dean of graduate education or the staff member's direct supervisor. There is a section on the Consulting Approval Form to request and document the required approval related to staff and students. Safeguards must be instituted on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the performance of University duties and the scholarly mission of the University are not compromised. In particular, faculty must avoid even the appearance of directing students into research activities that serve their own personal interests at the expense of scholarly achievement. Such arrangements with students may also require review and approval by the University's Individual Conflict of Interest Committee pursuant to the requirements outlined in Policy RA20, Individual Conflict of Interest.\nRATE OF COMPENSATION AND TAX CONSEQUENCES:\nThe University will not comment on or offer input regarding the rate of compensation or the tax consequences associated with faculty consulting activities.\nINTERNAL CONSULTING:\nFaculty and staff members cannot serve as consultants for University activities, either directly as private consultants, or through a third-party. In situations where consulting services are required from currently employed faculty and staff, compensation must be as an employee, whether within the scope of their appointment or through supplemental compensation.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD47 - General Standards of Professional Ethics.\nFN14 - Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services\nHR35 - Public Service by Members of the Faculty and Staff.\nHR42 - Payment of Personal Compensation by a State Agency or Department of the Commonwealth.\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest.\nAD77 - Engaging in Outside Professional Activities (Conflict of Commitment)\nRP02 - Handling Inquiries\/Investigations Into Questions of Ethics in Research and in Other Scholarly Activities.\nRP06 - Technology Transfer & Entrepreneurial Activity (Faculty Research).\n\u00a0\nAPPENDIX A\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUES:\nAll faculty are required to sign the Penn State Intellectual Property Agreement which states that all faculty agree as a condition of employment by the University to abide by the University's Intellectual Property Policies and Procedures.\nFaculty may, within the scope of a consulting agreement, assign rights to intellectual property developed under consulting agreements to organizations engaging their services where the organization has a legitimate prior claim to the technology being developed. Examples include consulting activity leading to the refinement of an organization's existing product or process or to a development for which the organization has background patents or prior art claims.\nIt is inappropriate for faculty consultants to assign Penn State intellectual property to organizations engaging their services.\nConsulting agreements should be examined to ensure that the assignment of rights to intellectual property evolving from consulting activities does not conflict with the Penn State Intellectual Property Agreement.\nFaculty consultants must avoid entering into consulting agreements that are in violation of the terms of their employment by the University.\nFaculty members should be cautious that by assigning intellectual property rights to organizations engaging their services faculty consultants may: 1) be prohibited from further activities in that field, 2) limit opportunities to profit from commercial applications or their work, 3) limit opportunities to obtain funding from industry and 4) restrict freedom to publish.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS RECOMMENDED FOR INCLUSION IN FACULTY CONSULTING AGREEMENTS:\nConsulting agreements should recognize that all faculty members have signed the Penn State Intellectual Property Agreement and that Penn State intellectual property cannot be transferred to a company via a consulting agreement. Consulting agreements should also recognize that a faculty member's first duty and first responsibility is to Penn State. The University recommends including the following language:\n\"Company agrees and understands that Consultant is an employee of The Pennsylvania State University. Consultant's primary responsibility is to the University. In connection with such employment, Consultant has entered into certain agreements with the University relating to ownership of intellectual property rights, conflicts of interest and other matters, and is subject to certain policy statements of the University (collectively the \"Institutional Agreement\"). If any provision of this Agreement is hereinafter determined to be in conflict with the Institutional Agreement, then the Institutional Agreement will govern to the extent of such conflict, and the conflicting provisions of this Agreement will not apply. Consultant is not aware of any such conflict.\"\nConsulting agreements should acknowledge the importance of documenting the nature and scope of the consulting activities and outline a process for preparing a written summary or minutes of the consulting activities. All written information provided by the company to the consultant should be clearly marked \"Confidential\" or \"Proprietary\". The University recommends including the following language:\n\"The Company shall from time to time prepare a written summary or \"minutes\" of the consulting activities of Consultant. Consultant shall also record all documentation relative to Consulting Services separate from his\/her other work, including work for the University. The parties shall have the right to periodically compare said documentation to ensure both parties have a consistent understanding as to the scope and nature of consulting services provided hereunder.\"\nConsider including language such that the consultant has the right to refuse to accept company confidential information. The University recommends including the following language:\n\t\t\u00a0\n\"Prior to disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder, Company shall make a non-enabling summary disclosure to Consultant so that Consultant may determine whether to accept disclosure. Said summary shall be sufficient to enable Consultant to determine whether the disclosure involves technology or information already under development in Consultant's University Laboratory, or whether he\/she is otherwise bound by confidentiality concerning related information and\/or technology.\"\n\"Company will take reasonable precautions to clearly mark information disclosed hereunder as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary.\" Company will provide to Consultant a written summary of the matters discussed or considered during consulting provided hereunder in a timely manner.\"\n\"The confidentiality restrictions hereunder will not apply where the information was previously known to or developed by Consultant or Consultant's research group, where the information is part of the public domain, or where the information came into the possession of Consultant through no fault or wrongdoing of Consultant.\"\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS TO BE AVOIDED IN FACULTY CONSULTING AGREEMENTS:\nConsultants required to accept \"fiduciary\" responsibility should be covered by insurance protection provided by the company.\nConsulting activities should be performed in a relatively narrow and well-defined field. Avoid broad definitions such as \"Company Business\".\nAvoid or use caution in accepting exclusive consulting arrangements. Consider the ramifications of agreeing to consult with only one company in a broad field.\nCarefully consider the term (duration) of the consulting agreement. Is there an exit? Can the faculty member terminate the consulting agreement \"without cause\"?\nCarefully review any requirements for representations and warranties, especially with regard to intellectual property issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the conditions governing private consulting by individuals holding a faculty appointment.This policy does not apply to University staff or graduate students."},{"university":"psu","name":"tr01","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Travel Requirements | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesInternational Travel Requirements \n\n\n\nTravel Policies\n\nTR01\nInternational Travel Requirements\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nSubject Matter Expert:\u00a0\n\n    Gary Langsdale,\n    814-865-6308,\n    \n      gwl3@psu.edu    \n\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nOffice of the Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nOverview\nScope \nDefinitions\nUse of the Travel Safety Network \nEmergency Preparedness Workshop- Students, Faculty Leading Student Groups \nTraveling with Technology\nTraveling to Countries on the Insurance Industry's List of Restricted Countries, and the U.S. State Department Warnings List\nUniversity-Sponsored Student Group Trips\nExport Control and International Travel\nWho May Participate in University Affiliated Student Group International Travel\nUse of Tour Providers\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nOVERVIEW:\nInternational travel affords unique educational, research and business opportunities to the members and affiliates of the Pennsylvania State University (\"Penn State\" or \"University\") community. While supporting these opportunities, the University must manage the risks associated with them, balancing safety obligations to its participants while honoring restrictions placed upon the University by applicable laws and\/or University academic, research or business partners.\nSCOPE:\nThis policy applies to all University employees, students, authorized volunteers and guests of the University\u00a0while travelling as part of any University Affiliated International Travel, regardless of the funding source, including individuals and groups of students participating in for-credit academic study-abroad experiences.\nDEFINITIONS:\nUniversity Affiliated International Travel - Any travel by University employees, students, authorized volunteers and guests\u00a0to an international destination which is for educational, research, or business purposes tied to the traveler\u2019s affiliation with the University. This includes travel by groups affiliated with the University, such as Recognized Student Organizations and travel to professional conferences\/meetings regardless of the funding source including if the University travelers\u2019 costs are paid by an outside organization.\nUniversity Affiliated Student Group International Travel \u2013 All international travel outlined in Policy FN20 as well as international travel by Recognized Student Organizations which includes at least two students.\u00a0 This includes travel to professional conferences\/meetings even if paid by an outside organization.\nMembers and Affiliates of the University Community - University employees, undergraduate students, graduate students, authorized volunteers and guests travelling as part of any kind of University Affiliated International Travel. For purposes of this Policy, Graduate Assistants traveling in their work capacity will follow the same requirements and guidance as faculty and staff. For programs sponsored by Education Abroad, \"students\" includes recent graduates who enrolled in the University Affiliated International Travel while still a student even though the travel takes place after graduation.\nAuthorized Volunteers - Individuals who are not included in the definition of Members and Affiliates of the University Community, who accompany a\u00a0University group at the request of the group leader with the support of the College or Campus executive, for the purpose of enhancing the group's experience based on their subject matter, linguistic skill, or geographical knowledge. Notification and approval by the Vice Provost of Global Programs is required.\nUSE OF THE TRAVEL SAFETY NETWORK:\nThe Travel Safety Network (TSN) at Penn State is a database and network of resources to support international engagement across the institution and enhance the safety and security of University travelers. Global Programs oversees the TSN. Global Programs staff monitor events (e.g., political unrest, infectious outbreaks, natural disasters, etc.) that may impact travel. The TSN enables Penn State to more quickly and efficiently provide travelers with emergency assistance (e.g., medical or security), in the event of an emergency or crisis overseas. As part of this network, Global Programs works with University Risk Management, Student Activities, Export Compliance, and others across the University.\nAll students traveling on University Affiliated International Travel must record the trip with the TSN prior to travel, if their travel is not part of a University-affiliated group trip which has already been recorded. Employees must enroll their University Affiliated International Travel prior to travel in order to be compliant with AD89, University Export Compliance Policy (see \"Export Control and International Travel,\" below). Students and employees traveling internationally on an Education Abroad program will have their travel recorded by Education Abroad and do not need to complete a TSN record for these programs. Complete travel enrollment information must be submitted not less than 30 days prior to individual travel or as soon as possible if the decision to travel is made less than 30 days prior to departure. For group travel, all individual and group enrollment information must be submitted and receive final approval 30 days prior to travel. TSN data should be updated as the traveler\u2019s itinerary changes by contacting TSN@psu.edu. Enrollment of all faculty, staff, and student travel in advance of the trip shall be mandatory as a predicate to the individual being reimbursed for their travel expenses.\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WORKSHOP FOR STUDENTS\u00a0AND FACULTY\/STAFF LEADING STUDENT GROUPS:\nAll students who are traveling abroad on University Affiliated International Travel must participate in an Emergency Preparedness or pre-departure orientation session offered by the Global Programs prior to departure. Students must attend a session once every two years as a condition of participating in University Affiliated International Travel.\nFaculty and\/or staff traveling with a group of students internationally are also required to participate in an emergency preparedness session for leaders offered by Global Programs prior to departure.\u00a0 Faculty and staff operating in this capacity must attend a session once every two years from their last workshop participation as a condition of participating in University Affiliated International Travel with students.\nUniversity employees not supervising students but traveling internationally for research, conferences, or other University Affiliated International Travel reasons may participate in the emergency preparedness sessions for their own information, but it is not required.\nTRAVELING WITH TECHNOLOGY:\nTraveling with technology presents concerns and challenges. When travel involves crossing an international border, concerns center on the traveler\u2019s safety and security, as well as securing data and devices, and safeguarding the integrity of Penn State systems and networks. Travelers should review Traveling with Technology on how to safeguard University equipment and devices as well as personally identifiable information.\nTRAVELING TO COUNTRIES ON THE OFAC LIST OF RESTRICTED COUNTRIES, THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY\u2019S LIST OF RESTRICTED COUNTRIES, AND THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL WARNING LIST:\nThe University is always concerned with the safety of all members of the University Community while traveling as part of any University Affiliated International Travel. Therefore, the following restrictions have been instituted:\nFACULTY AND STAFF: The University does not by policy prohibit its faculty or staff from traveling to any country in the world.\u00a0 However, the U. S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) places travel restrictions on certain locations or activities. Further, the University's workers\u2019 compensation insurance voices serious travel and safety concerns for travel to the countries on the Insurance Industry\u2019s List of Restricted Countries. Travel to the countries on these lists must be reviewed and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nTravel and security plans related to any of the countries identified on the Insurance Industry\u2019s List of Restricted Countries must be reviewed in advance of departure by the International Restricted Travel Committee in order to engage resources to understand the specific risks, develop a safety plan to mitigate the likelihood of injury, and determine the best path forward.\u00a0 Travel to any of the countries identified on the Insurance Industry\u2019s List of Restricted Countries cannot take place until approval is given concerning the identified risks. The review is initiated by completing a Restricted Travel petition as part of a TSN travel record for individual travel, or as part of the proposal phase for an Education Abroad program.\nThese requirements apply for all University Affiliated International Travel for faculty and staff, including when hosting or attending Student Group travel.\nSTUDENTS (INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP): Students on University Affiliated International Travel, including Recognized Student Organizations, are restricted from traveling to countries with a U.S. State Department Travel Warning or a country on the Insurance Industry's List of Restricted Countries, unless approved through completing an exception petition described below.\u00a0\nRESTRICTED TRAVEL PETITION: Travelers must utilize the following procedures which have been integrated into the TSN enrollment process or Education Abroad program proposal process:\nEmployees planning travel to a country on the\u00a0Insurance Industry\u2019s List of Restricted Countries must complete a Restricted Travel Petition as part of creating a travel record in TSN.\nStudents planning University Affiliated International Travel to a country with a U.S. State Department Travel Warning\u00a0or a country on the Insurance Industry's List of Restricted Countries must complete a Restricted Travel Petition as part of creating a travel record in TSN or an Education Abroad program application.\nFaculty\/Staff traveling with Students to a country with a U.S. State Department Travel Warning must complete a Restricted Travel Petition as part of creating a travel record in TSN or an Education Abroad program proposal.\nFor Undergraduates who wish to travel on University Affiliated International Travel in countries subject to a Travel Warning issued by the U.S. State Department, see Undergraduate Policy R-7.\nGraduate Students shall refer to Graduate Student Policy for Travel to Countries on the U.S. State Department Warnings List.\nInternational travel by Recognized Student Organizations shall not be permitted to countries with a U.S. State Department Travel Warning or countries on the Insurance Industry's List of Restricted Countries without approval of a Restricted Travel Petition created as part of the group TSN record. Recognized Student Organizations should contact their campus Student Activities Office for instructions on this process.\nUNIVERSITY-SPONSORED STUDENT GROUP TRIPS:\nRefer to Policy FN20 for the approval guidelines for any international travel by a student group sponsored by the University. As defined in policy FN20, student group travel refers to a group consisting of two or more students accompanied by a University employee with a purpose that is relevant to the University's mission. Groups of five (5) or more student participants that include undergraduate students\u00a0must be accompanied by a minimum of two (2) University employees, and additional employees should be considered for large groups in consultation with Global Programs.\u00a0The requirement for accompaniment is not applicable for travel involving exclusively graduate students, medical students,\u00a0or law school students. In all cases, regardless of group size or student status as undergraduate or graduate, if the student group travel is part of an Education Abroad program, participants must be enrolled in credit-bearing course(s) at the University. No unenrolled participants may travel with the program as \"students\" or guests.\nEXPORT CONTROL AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL:\nAs specified in Policy AD89, the United States Government has established certain laws and implemented certain regulations and guidelines to restrict, prevent and\/or inhibit access to or provision of certain information, materials, equipment, services and\/or financial resources by, to, or for the benefit of unauthorized foreign nationals.\u00a0 These laws, regulations, and guidelines are often collectively referred to as \"Export Controls.\"\nAll University employees must comply with all U.S. laws and regulations when traveling internationally on University Affiliated International Travel, including the complex set of U.S. laws and regulations governing the export of controlled materials, software, technology, data, financial resources and services. It is required under Policy AD89, therefore, that an export compliance review be obtained prior to commencement of any University Affiliated International Travel to evaluate the proposed international travel event against any applicable Export Control laws or regulations.\nFor the convenience of the international traveler and to streamline the processes in place at the University, as well as to satisfy federal record retention requirements under applicable Export Control laws and regulations, the required export compliance review for University Affiliated International Travel has been integrated into the TSN enrollment process.\u00a0 Notification of completed enrollments in the TSN will be provided automatically to the University Export Compliance Office. In the event any additional information about a travel event recorded in the TSN is necessary in order to complete the required AD89 export compliance review, the traveler will be contacted directly by a University Export Compliance Specialist for further follow-up.\u00a0University employees who have completed the required TSN enrollment will have met the requirement of AD89 to obtain the prior export compliance review of the travel event.\u00a0 Additional documentation and guidance information about the application of Export Control laws and regulations to University Affiliated International Travel is available within the TSN system.\nUniversity Affiliated International Travel which cannot, for whatever reason, be recorded in the TSN, must be submitted directly to the University Export Compliance Office (UECO) for completion of the AD89 required export compliance review, subject to the same timing requirements outlined above for enrollments in the TSN (30 days prior to travel or as soon as travel plans are completed for travel arranged within 30 days of travel).\u00a0 Forms for submission of non-TSN eligible University Affiliated International Travel are available on the UECO website.\nNo export review is required for employees traveling internationally on personal vacation or attending conferences or other events solely at their own personal expense. However, a review is required if the University or any third party contributes to funding any costs associated with the travel, including, but not limited to, salary reimbursement, travel expenses or incidental expenses. If there is any doubt about whether a particular travel event is subject to the AD89 export compliance review requirement, it is recommended that the traveler simply submit such travel event for review via TSN enrollment or completion of the non-TSN eligible forms.\nThe failure to comply with any applicable U.S. Export Laws and Regulations may result in personal civil and\/or criminal liabilities for the traveler, up to, and including, debarment, fines and\/or imprisonment.\u00a0 More information about export compliance at the University is available in Policies AD89, ADG09, RA40, and RAG40, or at the UECO website.\nWHO MAY PARTICIPATE IN UNIVERSITY AFFILIATED STUDENT GROUP INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL:\nPenn State employees leading academically-related international travel with a group of students are expected to devote their attention to the oversight of the students when involved in course activities, non-academic activities which they arrange and\/or participate, and while traveling. All travelers are expected to comply with all relevant University Policies, local laws and applicable policies of host institutions; additionally, students are expected to adhere to the Penn State Student Code of Conduct.\u00a0\u00a0Spouses\/domestic partners (except for a faculty\/staff spouse\/partner who is co-teaching the program\u2019s academic content) and children of faculty and staff\u00a0engaged in such a program may be permitted to accompany such travel with prior authorization as part of the program application process, to be granted by the Vice Provost for Global Programs, after consultation with the Risk Management Office and the program\u2019s College Dean or Campus Chancellor.\nCommunity members (including alumni, spouses and children of students) are not permitted to accompany University Affiliated Student Group International Travel. Rare exceptions may be made for community members serving as official University volunteers, and permission for such an exception may only be granted by the by the Vice Provost for Global Programs, after consultation with the Risk Management Office and the sponsoring unit\u2019s Budget Executive, Dean or Chancellor.\nUSE OF TOUR PROVIDERS:\nFor any University Affiliated Student Group International Travel programs, the Risk Management Office has established contractual requirements for tour service providers, and either Procurement Services or the Risk Management Office must process such agreements for authorized University signature in accordance with these contractual requirements.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of Global Programs or the Risk Management Office.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD89 \u2013 University Export Compliance Policy\nADG09 \u2013 Export Compliance Definitions, Procedures and Implementation Guidelines\nFN20 - Student Group Travel Policy\nRA40 - Compliance with Federal Export Regulations for Sponsored Research Efforts (Formerly RA18)\nRAG40 - Guidelines for Ensuring Compliance with Export Control Policy RA40 (Formerly RAG11)\nR-7: International Travel Policy for Penn State Undergraduate Students\nGraduate Student Policy for Travel to Countries on the U.S. State Department Warnings List\nPenn State\u2019s Travel Safety Network (TSN)\nInternational Travel Information\nStudent Organization Travel Policy\nUniversity Export Compliance Office (UECO)\nPenn State Travel Policy\nEffective Date:\u00a0\n\tDate Approved:\u00a0\n\tDate Published:\u00a0\nMost Recent Changes:\nJanuary 4, 2018 - to modify the language around family members of faculty accompanying them on trips.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMay 16, 2016 - New policy.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nJanuary 19, 2018>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nJanuary 19, 2018>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nJanuary 22, 2018>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"All requirements of the Penn State Travel Policy apply for University-affiliated travel.

All changes to committed cost sharing must be updated in IBIS through the UACT screen.\nTo ensure compliance with the documentation requirements for committed cost sharing, all committed cost sharing from general funds for a specific agreement should be accounted for through a general fund cost sharing account cost center, using the same budget function (function code) as the agreement (Instruction, Research, Continuing Education). Committed cost sharing from miscellaneous funds, such as gifts and endowments or MGR, must be accounted for through a miscellaneous fund cost sharing account, using cost centers to identify the match for each grant or contract. The name of the cost center must include the current fund number of the agreement for central reporting purposes.\nOther cost sharing should be accounted for as follows:\nFringe benefits: If the fringe rates are identical for the cost sharing account and the sponsored award, no additional documentation is required. If the rates differ, then the difference should be calculated manually and included in any reporting of itemized matching costs.\nTuition: Tuition for graduate assistants paid from the grant-in-aid budget can be reallocated to the cost sharing cost center for the sponsored award \u2013 although temporary budget dollars from the general funds GIA account cannot be reallocated without advance approval from the Assistant Controller. Cost sharing can also be tracked within the GIA account through use of a cost center.\nF&A costs for cost sharing accounted for on general funds is to be calculated manually and separately in accordance with approved rates and included in any reporting of itemized matching costs.\nThird Party Contributions to Cost Sharing (e.g. an industrial grant)\nManaged by the University - If a portion of the grant is used as cost sharing, use a cost center to track the portion of that account used for cost sharing (The cost center name should include the fund number of the grant for which the match is being made).\nIncurred by Third Party \u2013 The third party should provide a written report documenting their contributions to the committed cost sharing for a particular grant or agreement. Sample Third Party Cost Share Commitment Letters and Confirmations can be found here. See RA50, Cost Sharing, for specific valuation guidance.\n\nUNCOMMITTED COST SHARING:\nUncommitted cost sharing is not and must not be identified specifically in the proposal budget or award or any modification, and must not be documented or accounted for as part of the award.\nAdditionally, uncommitted cost sharing, per clarification in Memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001, \"must be treated differently from committed effort and should not be included in the organized research base for computing the F&A rate or reflected in any allocation of F&A costs.\" Given this requirement, uncommitted cost share has specific requirements for documentation:\nMust not be reported to the sponsor. Therefore, it is prohibited from being included with committed cost share in the same cost sharing accounts or cost centers.\nMust be tracked for internal reporting purposes to assure these costs are appropriately categorized for calculation of the F&A rate.\nUncommitted cost sharing should be posted to an account which is NOT categorized as organized research. However, if it is accounted for in the organized research base (through posting to an account coded as organized research) for other purposes, uncommitted cost sharing must be segregated and reported centrally to assure these costs are reclassified for purposes of the F&A rate calculation performed by Cost Analysis.\n\nMust be specifically identified and charged to assure these costs are not inappropriately charged to another federal award. For example, if a PI spends 50% of their effort on an award, but only 40% of their effort may be charged to the award, then the additional 10% must be treated as uncommitted cost sharing. The 10% additional effort must be accounted for in a separate account to appropriately account for 100% of the PIs effort.\nPlease refer to Cost Sharing FAQs for more detail regarding cost sharing.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially the following:\nRA10 - Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards\nRA50 - Cost Sharing (Formerly RAG10)\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nApril 16, 2018 - Links added to sample Third Party Cost Share Commitment Letters and Confirmations\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new guideline has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"Policy RA50 provides policy regarding cost sharing.

Indirect (F&A) Costs\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\n\nFEDERAL POLICY:\nAs a condition of receiving federal grants and contracts, Penn State agrees to follow federal policies, including 2 CFR Part 200 - UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS, also referred to as the Uniform Guidance. The Uniform Guidance, specifically Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles, provides detailed requirements regarding costs on sponsored awards as well as definitions of direct, indirect, allowable and unallowable costs. In addition, the Uniform Guidance requires that Universities comply with certain regulations, including Title 48: Federal Acquisition Regulations System, Part 9905 - Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) for Educational Institutions:\nCAS 9905.501 \u2013 Consistency in Estimating, Accumulating and Reporting Costs\nPIs and administrative support staff must ensure compliance by maintaining consistency in the manner in which proposal budgets are prepared and how the funds are budgeted and expenses accounted for during the life cycle of the award.\n\nCAS 9905.502 \u2013 Consistency in Allocating Costs Incurred for the Same Purpose\nPenn State complies by ensuring costs incurred for the same purpose, in similar circumstances, are treated consistently in our accounting system.\u00a0\n\nCAS 9905.505 \u2013Accounting for Unallowable Costs\nPIs and administrative support staff must ensure that costs defined as \"unallowable\" are not directly charged to Federal projects.\n\nCAS 9905.506 \u2013 Cost Accounting Period\nPenn State must comply with several rules governing how costs are treated for the purposes of calculating and negotiating our F&A rate.\n\nALLOWABLE, ALLOCABLE, AND REASONABLE:\nAllowable costs:\nAllowable costs are specifically related to the sponsored agreement, benefit the sponsored agreement in the proportion to the amount charged, and conform to the policies and procedures of Penn State. The costs must be necessary for the performance of the project. A particular cost may be allowable on one project, where it is specifically needed for performance, but unallowable on another project where no similar performance requirement exists.\nDetailed factors affecting the allowability of costs are outlined in Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.403. These factors include:\nCosts must be necessary and reasonable\nCosts must be given consistent treatment\nCosts must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the sponsored agreement or in the Federal Cost Principles (See Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.420 Considerations for selected items of cost)\nMore detail is available in FNG05 \u2013 Expenditure Guidelines for Costs Not Allowable under OMB\n\t\t\t\tUniform Guidance\n\nCosts cannot be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements for any other federally-financed program.\nCost must be adequately documented.\nIt is the purpose of the charge, not necessarily the type of charge that determines its allowability.\nAllocable costs:\nAllocable costs are those that provide direct benefits to the project and can be specifically identified to that project with a high degree of accuracy.\nThe detailed criteria to meet the allocability standard are available in the Uniform Guidance - \u00a7200.405 Allocable costs. A cost is allocable to a sponsored agreement if:\nIs incurred solely to advance the work funded under the sponsored project;\nBenefits both the sponsored project and other work of Penn State in proportions that can be clearly documented\n\t\tthrough reasonable methods.\nA cost may also be allocable to multiple projects. It is important that the costs be allocated appropriately across all projects which benefit. It is not appropriate to charge all of the cost of an item to one sponsored award if it benefits more than one award\u2013 each cost needs to be allocated based on how it benefits the various projects. Per Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.405-(d)\nDirect cost allocation principles. \"If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost should be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then ... the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset involved when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required.\"\nSome costs may only partially benefit a sponsored award \u2013 in such cases, the costs should be allocated to the sponsored award based only on the percentage of benefit derived from that cost item, with the balance of the cost charged to an appropriate non-sponsored account.\nThe Uniform Guidance also discusses transfers of costs under the allocability standard:\nUniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.405-(c) - Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award under the principles provided for in this part may not be charged to other Federal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal awards, or for other reasons. However, this prohibition would not preclude the non-Federal entity from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.\nIn other words, costs which are truly allocable to an award may be transferred or shifted if allowable under the award to which it is being transferred, but cost overruns may not be transferred to another federal award.\nReasonable cost:\nReasonable costs reflect the actions a prudent person would take at the time the decision was made to incur the costs. Reasonable costs are those that are generally recognized as necessary for the success of the sponsored agreement and are consistent with the sponsor requirements and Penn State policy.\nThe detailed considerations to determine reasonableness of a given cost are available in the Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.404 - Reasonable costs. A cost is considered reasonable if:\nIt is generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the performance of the sponsored project;\nIt does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of business; in other words, would this cost be reasonable if being paid personally? Does it compare to market prices for comparable goods and services?\nIt meets the requirements imposed by Federal and State regulations, terms and conditions of a sponsored agreement, or agency guidelines;\nThe individuals acted with prudence in considering their responsibilities to Penn State, its employees, its students, State or Federal Government, and the public at large; and\nThe actions taken to incur the cost are consistent with established institutional policies and practices applicable to the work of the institution generally and inclusive of sponsored projects.\nDETERMINATION STRATEGY:\nWhen incurring costs against sponsored awards the PI, with assistance from the administering staff, must ensure only allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs are charged to sponsored agreements. To determine whether a particular cost is allowable, allocable and reasonable, apply the \"prudent person\" test. If the answer to any of the following questions is \"no,\" then the costs should not be charged to a sponsored award:\nIs the cost necessary for the performance and\/or successful completion of the technical scope of the project?\nIs the cost to be charged reasonable?\nCould you comfortably explain to someone outside the University why this item was charged to your project?\nIs charging this expense consistent with PSU policies?\n\nThe primary question to ask in making a determination as to whether a particular cost is allowable, allocable and reasonable is: Does the cost benefit the project?\nSeveral documents are available which in most circumstances will provide a measure of confidence as to whether a certain expense is allowable, allocable, and reasonable.\nThe agency-approved budget for the project. The allowability of a cost is first determined by examining the budget that the agency approved for the project. Does the proposed expense show up under a line item of the budget? If the item does not appear in the budget, then other reviews must be conducted to determine if the item is allowable under rebudgeting authority that may be granted in the situation, or if the item may be allowable if prior approval is obtained in writing from the agency. If the budget has not been incorporated into the award document, then allowability must be determined in accordance with allowable cost principles of the agreement (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200 Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles), plus agency deviations).\nNOTE: Any approval from an agency regarding costs must be coordinated through the appropriate Research Administrator for the sponsor. Technical contacts do not have the authority to make decisions regarding the allowability of costs. The Sponsor's Research Administrator can ensure that the appropriate administrative authority of the sponsor is contacted and that written approval is received before determination is made that a cost is allowable, allocable and reasonable.\n\nThe award document issued by the sponsor. Allowability of certain costs may be addressed within the award document or the contract\/agreement issued for the sponsored project. For example, grant awards may identify certain costs that are specifically unallowed by the agency based upon recommendations from the peer review system.\nAgency Guidelines on award administration. Even if the type of expense proposed appears on the budget, the specific expense may not be allowable. Most Federal agencies have guidelines for administering grants. These guidelines give direction on the allowability of certain costs. For example, travel costs may appear in the budget, but the specific cost for airfare to Europe for a meeting may require prior approval according to the guidelines of the specific sponsoring agency.\nUniform Guidance. The OMB Uniform Guidance Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles details types of costs which are and are not allowable and must be followed for all federal awards.\nDIRECT VS. INDIRECT (F&A) COSTS:\nDirect Costs\nDirect costs are those expenses that are essential to the conduct of sponsored institutional activities and which can be readily attributed and directly charged to specific individual projects. They include expenditures for such items as personnel (salaries and fringe benefits), supplies, equipment, travel and other direct costs necessary for conducting the sponsored activity. See Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.413 Direct Costs.\nIndirect Costs - Facilities & Administrative Costs (F&A)\nFacilities and administrative (F&A) costs (also referred to as indirect costs or overhead) are those expenses that are essential to the conduct of sponsored institutional activities but which cannot be readily attributed and directly charged to specific individual projects. (See Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.56, 2 CFR 200.414, and RA30 for further definition and guidance.)\nDetermination of Direct vs.F&A\nDetermining if a cost should be included as a direct cost must be done at the proposal stage. There are certain departmental costs which are included as F&A, and therefore, should not be included as a direct cost. PIs should work closely with the Research Administrator to ensure that costs normally considered F&A are not included as direct costs in a proposal, unless there is a compelling reason to do so.

In addition to Vice Presidents', Academic Deans, and Chancellors, such offices shall include the following: offices of Assistant and Associate Vice Presidents; Assistant and Associate Deans; Department or Division Heads; Directors of Research Units; and Directors of Academic Affairs at the non-University Park locations.\nPROCESS:\nBecause of the diversity of the University, the specific process for periodic review of academic administrative officers and their offices is not prescribed for each unit.\nEach academic administrative officer directly responsible to either the Executive Vice President and Provost or the Senior Vice President for Health Affairs and Dean of the College of Medicine shall, in consultation with either the Executive Vice President and Provost or the Senior Vice President for Health Affairs and Dean of the College of Medicine and the appropriate administrative and faculty groups for this office, develop a process for the review of those academic administrative officers and their offices reporting to him or her within guidelines listed below.\nThe processes shall without exception include mechanisms whereby a central office at the provost\u2019s level, as well as faculty of the pertinent unit shall be informed when the review is started, when the review is completed, and that the next highest academic administrative officer has been informed of the results of the review and has prepared and distributed a summary to faculty and staff in the academic unit.\nGUIDELINES:\nAcademic administrative officers and their offices ordinarily shall be reviewed at regular intervals. The offices of Deans and their Associate or Assistant Deans, as well as Chancellors and the Directors of Academic Affairs, may be scheduled for simultaneous or separate reviews. Such reviews, however, shall be conducted in addition to conventional annual evaluations. The typical period between reviews shall be five years; however, some flexibility is afforded depending upon circumstances. It is always desirable to initiate an exit review when a principal academic office is vacated, e.g., by resignation or retirement, or when significant changes are proposed.\nResponsibility for initiating and implementing the periodic review of academic administrative officers and their offices rests with the administrator at the next highest level.\nAcademic members of the unit being reviewed shall be significantly involved in the review process. Appropriate academic members from other related units, and academic administrative peers, are recommended to be included in the review process.\nThe general results of the review shall be made known to the responsible academic administrative officer by the next highest academic administrative officer. Within 30 days, the administrator under review shall submit a response concerning actions taken, underway, and planned. In general terms that do not violate the confidentiality of the review or the incumbent\u2019s response, the administrator supervising the review shall prepare a summary of the major findings and the incumbent\u2019s objectives and goals for the next five years. This summary shall be distributed to faculty and staff in the academic unit. Confidentiality of personnel evaluations shall be maintained.\nAs part of the conventional annual review referenced above, each administrator shall submit to\u00a0his or her supervisor a progress report based on the five-year goals enumerated in his or her most recent AD14 review or if prior to the administrator\u2019s first AD14 review, goals outlined in consultation with his or her supervisor.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs.\nMost recent changes:\n\nMay 1, 2018 - Moved from Administrative Policy (AD14) to Academic Policy (AC14).

The arrests and convictions that must be reported are listed on the self-disclosure form.\nFailure to report any arrest or conviction may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Employees of consulting companies and\/or contractors are expected to inform their employers, who will review the situation with the Office of Human Resources, Talent Acquisition Division.\nInformation will be used only if job related and will not necessarily affect employment. The Office of Human Resources will notify the employee's department of an arrest or conviction only if it is determined that the arrest and\/or conviction is pertinent to the employee's ability to carry out the duties or functions of his or her position. Depending on the facts and the employee's involvement in the events leading to arrest and\/or conviction, arrests and convictions reported to the employee\u2019s department may subject the employee to discipline, up to and including termination.\nCONFIDENTIALITY:\nRecords gathered as a result of a background screening check will be maintained as confidential records by the University, and will be maintained in accordance with the Penn State records retention schedule.\nRELATED DOCUMENTS:\nSummary of rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act:\nwww.ftc.gov\/bcp\/edu\/pubs\/consumer\/credit\/cre35.pdf \nPenn State Arrest and Conviction self-disclosure form\nPenn State Information for Completing PA Publicly Available Background Checks\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD29 - Statement on Intolerance\nAD33 - A Drug-Free Workplace\nAD39 - Minors involved in University-sponsored Programs or Programs held at the University and\/or Housed in University Facilities\nAD41 - Sexual Harassment\nAD42 - Statement on Nondiscrimination\nAD72- Reporting Suspected Child Abuse\nBS17- Use and Procurement of External Consultants\nHR11 - Affirmative Action in Employment at The Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy outlines a process for ensuring background checks are completed for any individuals, age 16 and over, (paid or unpaid) who are engaged by Penn State in any work capacity.

ROLL OVER\nAt some campuses, the previous course offering is \"rolled forward\" to create the new course offering. The following criteria apply to the assignment of classroom(s) during the \u201croll over\u201d process:\nA. \u00a0All previously assigned departmentally controlled classrooms are maintained.\n\tB. \u00a0All previously assigned general purpose classrooms will be maintained unless:\nThe classroom is unavailable due to renovation or construction.\nClassroom seating capacity has been reduced.\nThe type of seating has changed.\nClassroom has been reclassified.\nPrevious semester course enrollment was below the seat utilization ratio of 70% *\nCourse does not satisfy the technology requirement in order to be scheduled back into the room.\nCourse is ineligible for scheduling into the room because it does not meet the college\/department priority scheduling requirement.\n2. PRIORITY SCHEDULING OF GENERAL PURPOSE CLASSROOMS (University Park)\nA number of GPCs at University Park have been designated by the Facilities Resources Committee (FRC) for \"priority\" scheduling by special agreement. The academic college or department with priority scheduling will have first opportunity to schedule. The specific dates when scheduling begins for priority GPCs are available on the Office of the University Registrar website at http:\/\/www.registrar.psu.edu\/staff\/activity_calendar\/activity_semester_index.cfm .\nCollege\/Department Credit Courses: Department staff can schedule credit courses into their priority assigned GPCs provided the section limit is at least 70% of the room capacity.\nOther Credit Courses: After the college\/department that has scheduling priority has scheduled all of their credit courses in their assigned GPC priority classrooms, other colleges\/departments will have the opportunity to schedule credit courses in these classrooms.\nDepartments may not block schedule a priority GPC at any time to prevent scheduling by other users. If this is an evident practice, the priority scheduling arrangement will be revoked. The Facilities Resources Committee can change priority assignments at any time for GPCs.\n3. GENERAL CREDIT\nGeneral purpose classrooms are scheduled for credit courses according to the following priority:\nstandard sequence courses\nnon-standard sequence courses\nCourses that follow a standard sequence will be scheduled first in order to maximize student access to courses and minimize time to degree.\nWhile it is recognized that some courses, for pedagogical reasons, do not fit neatly into the standard scheduling periods, extensive use of non-standard scheduling patterns makes it difficult for students to create a viable class schedule which can impede students\u2019 degree progress. It is therefore necessary to minimize the use of non-standard scheduling periods.\n4. INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT\nGPCs may be scheduled for instructional support activities such as evening exams, orientation and advising, or speakers directly related to a course after all credit courses have been scheduled.\n5. CO-CURRICULAR\nGPCs are available for student activities and special events after all credit courses have been scheduled. \u00a0All student events and activities that are scheduled must be sponsored by a Recognized Student Organization with an officer report form on file. \u00a0All Recognized Student Organization events held in GPCs must be scheduled by contacting the Student Affairs Office.\n6. \u00a0NON-CREDIT AND EVENTS\nThe University sponsors and supports many activities, conferences, meetings, special events, community outreach and service programs beyond those associated with credit-bearing programs. GPCs are available after credit-bearing programs have been accommodated on a room available basis in the following order:\nweekend events\nevening events\ndaytime events (scheduling begins one week after the start of the semester)\n\u00a0\nScheduling General Purpose Classrooms: GPCs will not be available for non-credit-bearing activities until all credit courses are first scheduled. GPCs will not be held in reserve for possible conference use. At University Park, requests for exceptions to this policy should be addressed to Vice President and Dean for Undergraduate Education. \u00a0At locations other than University Park, requests for exceptions should be addressed to the Vice President for Commonwealth Campuses.\nScheduling Other Spaces: Availability and use of rooms controlled by academic colleges or administrative units must be negotiated directly with the college or unit assigned the space requested.\n\u00a0\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the University Registrar.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD62 - Use of General Purpose Classrooms\nMost recent changes:\nDecember 1, 2015 - Editorial changes.

(Rates for this work must be approved by the Corporate Controller.) Permitted work includes, instructional work for credit and non-credit courses, conferences, workshops, institutes, training programs, etc.; support for faculty research, publications, presentations, and outreach activities; services for recognized student organizations; and services for other organized student extramural activities.\nUniversity tangible assets and services may not be used for personal gain, by employees for purposes outside the scope of their employment (see also Policy HR35 ), or by students beyond their instructional requirements. University resources are to be used for University business. Following are further policy statements regarding the policy on personal use of University equipment, staff and services:\nThe use of email, internet, and office phone services for reasonable personal use is permitted if the University incurs no additional incremental cost for personal use.\nThese services may never be used in the conduct of a personal business or any other for-profit venture from which the employee (or member of their family) would receive personal gain.\nEmployees should not use these services for personal use if additional costs are incurred (i.e., long-distance phone calls). If incremental charges are incurred, the University must be reimbursed for the cost.\nExcessive personal use which interferes with the employee's job performance is not appropriate and can be limited as needed by supervisors to assure employee productivity.\n\nThe use of University-owned equipment for personal use is generally not permitted, with the exception of technology equipment used for reasonable personal use as noted above.\nUniversity-owned technology equipment, such as computers and PDAs, may be permitted to be housed at an employee's home, but only if there is a business need for the use of that equipment at home and appropriate accountability forms are completed.\n\nThe use of University employees for services that would be considered personal, such as running errands or typing personal documents, is not permitted.\nThe use of non-public University facilities (those not available to the general public) for personal meetings or family events (see AD02 for additional policy statements) is not permitted.\nREPORTING NONCOMPLIANCE:\nEmployees are encouraged to report instances of noncompliance with this policy. Employees can report concerns or observations of misuse or theft of University assets or services to any of the following: the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor (unless they are the individual conducting the misuse), Internal Audit, the Employee Relations Division in the Office of Human Resources, their Financial Officer or Human Resources Representative, the University\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Office and\/or University Police. Alternatively, an employee can file a report with the University\u2019s Financial and Compliance Hotline at 1-800-560-1637 or at https:\/\/psuethicsandcompliance.tnwreports.com\/. If an employee reports a concern about or observation of misuse or theft to his or her immediate supervisor, the supervisor should contact any of the above-named remaining units or individuals. If the Financial Officer or the employee\u2019s work unit\u2019s Human Resource Representative receives a report from the employee or the employee\u2019s supervisor, they should contact Employee Relations, Internal Audit, the Ethics and Compliance Office or University Police.\nWhen a report of misuse or theft of University assets or services is received by Internal Audit, Employee Relations, and the University\u2019s Ethics and Compliance Office, they may consult and discuss with each other as necessary to insure the matter is properly addressed. If a decision is reached that the matter should be turned over to University Police, the Senior Vice President for Finance & Business\/ Treasurer should be notified concurrently with the referral of the matter to the Assistant Vice President for University Police\/Public Safety.\nWhen a report of misuse or theft of University assets or services is received directly by University Police, they shall have sole discretion as to how best to proceed with the investigation of the reported activity to ensure that the matter is appropriately and successfully addressed.\nEXCEPTIONS:\nPolicy AD06, \"Community Charity Solicitation of University Employees,\" outlines the specific exception for the use of services by a non-University entity.\nReasonable personal phone calls and faxes may be permitted at the discretion of the budget executive or budget administrator, and if authorized, any tolls and extra charges must be reimbursed by the employee to the University budget charged for the initial service.\nAny other exception dealing with the offering of services would be for services not commercially available within the region of the campus. University departments may perform such services for non-University organizations or individuals only with written approval in advance from the Corporate Controller. (see also Policy AD15)\nUSING UNIVERSITY ASSETS AWAY FROM THE UNIVERSITY:\nIf any tangible asset is to leave University owned or leased locations, a Request for Authorization to Use University Tangible Assets at a Non-University Location form must be completed and approved by the budget executive. Upon return of the tangible asset to the originating department in good condition, a departmental representative must sign a closing copy of the form to evidence the return of the tangible asset.\nIf the tangible asset is to leave University owned or leased locations for more than 30 days, and is individually tagged, Property Inventory must be notified. This notification must be via copy of the Request for Authorization to Use University Tangible Assets at a Non-University Location form. Also, upon return of the tangible asset to the originating department in good working order, a second copy of the Authorization form, signed by a second departmental representative indicating receipt, must be forwarded to Property Inventory.\nOTHER SITUATIONS:\nThe Request for Authorization to Use University Tangible Assets at a Non-University Location form does not have to be completed, nor Property Inventory notified, if:\n1) The asset is being transported for relocation to another University location. If the relocation is to last from thirty days up to and including a year, then a Report of Temporary Relocation of Tangible Assets must be completed. If the relocation is to last more than one year, then a Report of Disposition or Permanent Transfer of Tangible Assets  must be completed.\n2) The tangible asset is routinely used at a non-University location and the use is approved and documented (and reported to Property Inventory if tagged) by other means (e.g., the use of a University vehicle via \"VRES,\" etc.).\n3) The use of the tangible asset is in response to an emergency situation risking life or property. However, if the situation extends to thirty days, a Report of Temporary Relocation of Tangible Assets must be processed.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially:\nAD06 - Community Charity Solicitation of University Employees,\nAD15  - Fees and Charges For Facilities and Services,\nAD67 - Disclosure of Wrongful Conduct and Protection From Retaliation,\niP06 - Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurial Activity (Faculty Research),\nHR35 - Public Service by Members of the Faculty and Staff,\nHR80 - Private Consulting Practice, and\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest.\nEffective Date: June 17, 2016\n\tDate Approved: June 17, 2016\n\tDate Published: June 17, 2016\nMost Recent Changes:\nJune 17, 2016 - Revision in paragraph #2 of the REPORTING NONCOMPLIANCE section, clarifying the process\/notification requirements when a decision is made that noncompliance with the policy should be reported.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nApril 7, 2014 - Addition of a REPORTING NONCOMPLIANCE section, to provide guidance to employees for reporting concerns or observations of misuse or theft of University assets or services.\nSeptember 27, 2013 - Editorial changes.

However, the authority to maintain accounts receivable and collect payments on such receivables is granted only when there is a justifiably compelling reason to do so.\nSeveral areas have been granted an inherent right to maintain receivables. They are: Bursar (general receivables), Bursar (ISIS - student receivables), Financial Officers at Non-University Park locations, the Office of Research Accounting (receivables for sponsored activity), and the Hershey Medical Center Finance Office (Hershey Medical Center patients).\nOther areas may be granted a right to maintain receivables by their budget executive and Financial Officer.\nGUIDELINES:\nThe University has established general basic minimum performance criteria applicable to any area granted the authority to maintain its own receivables. These criteria appear in the University Procedure CR2066 - Guidelines for Accounts Receivable. That procedure also indicates the steps to be taken to procure the authority to maintain accounts receivables.\nBILLING TERMS:\nBilling terms of the University are `net payable upon receipt.'\nAreas of the University Which Have NOT Been Authorized to Maintain Accounts Receivables\nFor areas of the University which have NOT been authorized to maintain its own accounts receivable, all materials and permitted services (per Policy FN14) that are sold on a charge sale basis must be billed via CARP (Central Accounts Receivable Portal).\nAll checks received in payment of a billing must be made payable to The Pennsylvania State University.\nPayment must be mailed (or taken) to the Office of the Bursar. In the event that payments for charge sales are received at the department initiating the Invoice, such payments must be taken to the Bursar at once, without preparing a Report of Cash Receipts\nAreas of the University Which HAVE Been Authorized to Maintain Accounts Receivables\nFor areas which HAVE been authorized to maintain their own receivables, all materials and permitted services sold on a charge sale basis must be billed on the  Invoice (or an invoice meeting the requirements delineated in Procedure CR2066 - Guidelines for Decentralized Accounts Receivable).\nAll charge sales are reported to the University by the area authorized to maintain its own receivables when the remittances are received and the ROCR is prepared by the department.\nAll checks received in payment of a billing must be made payable to The Pennsylvania State University.\nPayments must be mailed (or taken) to the area designated for processing accounts receivables. An area may have various departments generating invoices and a central department maintaining the receivables. The payments are always to be remitted to the area authorized to maintain its own receivables.\nCREDIT ADJUSTMENTS:\nCredits covering the cancellation or adjustment of charges previously billed are to be reported in the same manner as the original charge sale. Details on the credit invoice should include the reason for the credit and a reference to the original billing.\nUNCOLLECTIBLE CHARGE SALES:\nFOR BURSAR'S RECEIVABLES\nIn the event that a charge sale processed through the Bursar is deemed uncollectible, the Office of the Bursar will request that the originating department issue a \"CREDIT\" to offset the existing charge. If a department refuses to or cannot issue a \"CREDIT,\" the Office of the Bursar will initiate a Journal Voucher to charge back the corresponding department and fund number that was credited on the original invoice. An invoice will be considered uncollectible if:\nIt was improperly addressed by the department which prepared the billing; or\nThe account remains unpaid following 6 months of consecutive collection attempts by the Office of the Bursar.\nBILLED UNDER APPROVED DEPARTMENTAL RECEIVABLES:\nThe area should make every effort to pursue all invoices in order to receive all the revenue due the department. However, if it is evident that there will be no remittance from a customer, all services should be withheld until all invoices (current, past due, and those which may have been written off of the local receivables) have been paid. Since these sales are not credited to the department's budget until a payment is processed, there is no central documentation to institute.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual may have specific application and should be referred to, especially;\nCentral Accounts Receivable Portal (CARP)\nFN07 - Electronic Payments - Credit Cards (formerly Credit Card Sales),\nFN14 - Use of Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services,\nFN16 - Interdepartmental Transactions, and\nProcedure CR2066 - Guidelines for Accounts Receivable\nEffective Date: September 23, 2014\n\tDate Approved: September 22, 2014\n\tDate Published: September 23, 2014\nMost recent changes:\nSeptember 23, 2014 - Revision to the AUTHORITY section, adding the Office of Research Accounting as one of the areas which has an inherent right to maintain receivables.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

The University Must Possess a Record of the Transaction\n2. The Person (or Organization) Paying Must Receive an Acknowledgement that the Revenue was Received by the University\n\nSeparation of Duties\nFurther Information\n\n\nTRANSACTION DOCUMENTATION:\nIt is important to comprehend that Policy FN01 recognizes the documentation of a transaction as two separate but related functions:\nthe University's possession of a record of all transactions, and\nthe need to provide an acknowledgement in certain situations to the person making payment.\n1. THE UNIVERSITY MUST POSSESS A RECORD OF THE TRANSACTION-\nThe primary reasons for this requirement are to capture information necessary.....\nfor determining what University budget\/fund is to receive credit for the revenue\nfor use in updating a department's internal customer records and management reports\nfor supporting sales tax and similar collections and remittances\nfor reconciling to the actual cash count at the conclusion of a business day\nfor problem resolution, should a future question occur related to the transaction\nfor updating inventory records as appropriate\nAs long as the documentation of a transaction captures the information indicated in Policy FN01  AND is protected so that it cannot be easily misplaced or modified without possible detection and it is readily retrievable, documentation may be hand-written, printed, or electronically or optically stored. This allows for the use of a wide variety of methods for recording a transaction including, but not limited to, cash registers, prenumbered receipt books, transaction logs, point-of-sale terminals, registration forms, and computer systems.\nIt should be noted that the documentation used to meet this requirement of the University possessing a record of the transaction does not necessarily have to be the same media as the acknowledgement that is given to the person paying. For example, a Center for the Performing Arts transaction may be recorded on a computer's hard disk, but the person paying receives tickets as the acknowledgement of the transaction.\nThere are two major risks faced by the University when revenue is accepted and the record of the transaction is not properly recorded, controlled and safeguarded. First, the loss of the information can result in additional work by the department participating in the transaction, and can reflect poorly upon the department and the University. For example, sound business practice dictates that the revenue-on-hand be reconciled to the records of transactions at the conclusion of each business day. If a transaction is not recorded or is lost, a successful reconciliation obviously will not occur and time will be spent trying the resolve the imbalance. If a record of a transaction does not exist, inventory records or a customer's account may not be updated. Second,  the recording of a transaction may be purposely avoided or destroyed in an attempt to cover up misappropriation of funds. If an individual removes both the record of a transaction and the revenue pertaining to that transaction, then a reconciliation between the revenue-on-hand and the transactions documentation for the day may balance although funds are missing.\nIt is in response to these two risks that Policy  FN01 calls for the control of transaction documentation. While it may not be cost-effective and possible to totally prevent misappropriation, controls should exist to make lost transaction records less likely, and if they occur, easier to detect. This was the premise behind the use of a prenumbered receipt. Since prenumbered receipts are to be issued in a consecutive manner, a missing receipt would be detectable as a missing number in the numeric series. Cash registers afford a similar control in that transactions are recorded on the control tape. In order to remove a transaction, the transaction would physically have to be cut from the control tape.\nIt should be noted that Policy FN01 indicates that a record of a transaction \"must be generated by the individual initially  accepting the revenue on behalf of the University.\" Once the revenue has been initially accepted by the University, no duplicate records of the transaction should be generated. For example, if a department has an office on one side of the campus that receives revenue and records transactions, then transfers the revenue to its business office at the end of the day for deposit, a University receipt must not also be issued by the business office to indicate acceptance of the revenue. This is merely a transfer of revenue within  the University that should be documented by an Accountability Transfer Form or other suitable transfer log or document. There should be only one official receipt\/record per transaction and the total of the recorded amounts of the transactions must reconcile to the associated revenue collected and the related Report of Cash Receipts.\nCredit card transaction slips may be a suitable record of transaction if they meet the criteria delineated in Policy FN01. In operations where a cash register or other means of recording transactions are considered the primary means, credit card transaction slips become supporting documentation, and therefore are not in conflict with the \"one record per transaction\" rule. Each area should clearly establish what documentation will be considered the \"record of transaction\" and what will be deemed support.\nEach area's Financial Officer has the responsibility for determining the adequacy of documentation and local procedures.\n2. THE PERSON (OR ORGANIZATION) PAYING MUST RECEIVE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE REVENUE WAS RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSITY:\nThe primary reasons for this requirement are:\nto provide the person paying with feedback that the University recognizes that the payment was made,\nas a courtesy to provide the person paying with a convenient proof of payment should the transaction need follow-up (e.g., the payment not properly being credited to person's account, the goods or services needing an adjustment or a refund, etc.). Refund Policy FN08 requires evidence of the original transaction, and\nreturns of merchandise.\nThis requirement applies regardless of the form of payment. A cancelled check by itself does not constitute a sufficient acknowledgement since it does not provide the required information specified by Policy FN01, Also, money orders and traveler's checks do not get returned to the person paying, once they are cancelled.\nThe concept of an acknowledgement is broader than the definition of a receipt. In fact, a receipt is defined as \"the written acknowledgement of payment received.\" Payments made in person will most commonly result in a cash register receipt or a prenumbered receipt being issued to the person paying. Acknowledgements to persons paying by mail may seem less obvious. For example, registration by mail for a University seminar should result in an enrollment confirmation being sent to the person paying. A mail order for something offered from the Alumni Association should result in a packing list\/statement being sent along with the goods to the person paying; and payments to a student's account should be reflected in the next account statement. Therefore, documentation which may not normally be termed a \"receipt\" may nonetheless qualify as an acknowledgement.\nSEPARATION OF DUTIES:\nThe processing of revenue is comprised of three main functions: collection\/recording of the revenue; depositing the money; and reporting\/reconciliation of revenue with the record of the transactions.Ideally, each function should be performed by a different individual. If at all possible, employees responsible for these functions should be rotated periodically without prior announcement. If staff is limited to two individuals to perform the processing functions, the individual collecting the revenue and recording the transactions should also deposit the revenue. The second individual should perform the reporting\/reconciliation of revenue with the record of the transactions and process the\u00a0Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) . At no time may one individual have control over the entire process.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: September 19, 1994 (Reviewed 07-26-16, with no changes)\n\tDate Approved: September 19,1994\n\tDate Published: September 19, 1994 (Reviewed 07-26-16, with no changes)\nMost Recent Changes:\nJuly 26, 2016 - Reviewed by Associate Controller and Assistant Controller\/Director-Financial Officers; information is still accurate.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 6, 2016 - Editorial changes in the TRANSACTION DOCUMENTATION section.

The purpose of the program is to promote research by U.S. companies engaged in innovation and commercialization of technology.\u00a0 Small companies can partner with universities to facilitate innovative research and technology development.\nOnly small for-profit businesses are eligible to apply for these Federal awards. \u00a0Although not required, small businesses receiving SBIR grants often choose to collaborate with universities and other non-profit research institutions.\u00a0 The Federal Government, however, places strict limits on subcontracting under SBIR awards\u2014specifically, the Principal Investigator for the small business must be a full-time employee (at least 51%) of the small business; for Phase I awards, no more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the SBIR award can be performed by any research institution; and for Phase II awards, no more than fifty percent (50%) can be performed by any research institution.\nAs a non-profit research institution, the University is not permitted to apply for SBIR grants on its own.\u00a0 The University does, however, collaborate as a subcontractor with small businesses and receives funds through SBIR subawards. \u00a0University faculty and other members of the campus research community are encouraged to participate in SBIR-funded research. \u00a0Startup companies formed by University inventors routinely seek SBIR funding.\nWhile small business-related research is encouraged, it can give rise to specific conflict of interest and conflict of commitment concerns.\u00a0 The University\u2019s Policy on Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests (Policy RP06, Formerly RA20, hereafter as the \u201cUniversity's Conflict of Interest Policy\u201d), addresses conflicts of interest in research. Additional conflicts and issues surrounding the use of University resources in connection with the performance of an SBIR award can also arise where the University Personnel and\/or their immediate family are a co-founder and\/or have an ownership interest in the small business awardee. \u00a0The purpose of this policy is to assure compliance with federal regulations and the University\u2019s policies.\nDEFINITIONS:\nUnless otherwise defined herein, all terms in this Policy should have the same meaning as defined in the University's\u00a0Conflict of Interest Policy\u00a0and the University\u2019s\u00a0STTR Collaboration Policy.\n\u201cUniversity Personnel\u201d means any faculty, investigator, employee, staff, and\/or any researcher, whether paid or unpaid, and including temporary or \u201cvisiting\u201d researcher or scientist appointments.\n\u201cImmediate Family\u201d means a spouse, domestic partner, or dependent children.\nSCOPE:\nThis Policy applies to all University Personnel, whether as a University employee or otherwise, in any research funded under a SBIR award.\nPOLICY:\nAll University Personnel who intend to participate in an SBIR subaward in any way with any small business must comply with this Policy, and all other applicable laws and University policies.\nDISCLOSURE AND REPORTING REQUIREMENT:\nAll faculty members, employees, staff, investigators, and researchers are responsible for disclosing financial interests in accordance with the University\u2019s Conflict of Interest Policy.\u00a0 In addition, faculty members, employees, investigators, and researchers are obligated to seek advice from the Office for Research Protections to discuss any possible conflict of interest prior to the University\u2019s acceptance of any SBIR subaward.\u00a0 Faculty members, employees, investigators, and researchers must also consult with the Office of Technology Management regarding any potential licensing or intellectual property issues prior to the University\u2019s acceptance of any SBIR award.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES:\nParticipation in the SBIR program requires observing the following principles:\nAll work performed for, or in connection with, any small business using University facilities, equipment, materials, employees, and\/or students related to an SBIR must be performed under a fully negotiated and executed: (a) sponsored research agreement or (b) other agreement approved by the Office of Sponsored Programs, that is in compliance with the University\u2019s Policy on the Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies, and Services (FN14); the University\u2019s Policy on Fees and Charges For Facilities and Services (AD15); and the University\u2019s Policy on Private Consulting Practice (AC80).\nNo University Personnel with an ownership interest, or whose Immediate Family has an ownership interest, in a small business entity may participate in research at the University related to an SBIR award involving that same small business.\nUniversity Personnel compensated under an SBIR subcontract cannot receive any compensation for the same SBIR-funded research from the small business.\u00a0 For example, University Personnel cannot concurrently have a consulting role with the company paid under the SBIR award and participate in a University portion of that same SBIR subaward.\nThe Principal Investigator for the University's subaward may not personally submit any proposals for any work to be performed using University facilities, equipment, materials, employees, and\/or students to be included in any submission by the small business to a funding agency for an SBIR application.\u00a0 Only University personnel with delegated signature authority to submit proposals on the University\u2019s behalf may submit such proposals. (See RA20 \u201cProposal Submission\u201d).\nNo faculty member is permitted to hold a full-time appointment at the University and concurrently serve as the Principal Investigator of an SBIR award for a small business entity.\nThe Principal Investigator for a small business and the Principal Investigator for the University subaward must be separate individuals, and may not be immediate family members.\nNo University Personnel are permitted to hold a management or officer position, a position as a member of the Board of Directors or the Scientific Advisory Board, or undertake any responsibilities with a small business having received SBIR grants absent prior approval as required by University Policy AC80. \u00a0Any such position or responsibilities must also be consistent with all other University policies, including the University's Policy on Engaging in Outside Professional Activities (Conflict of Commitment) (Policy AD77), and the University\u2019s Conflict of Interest Policy.\nNo University student, staff member, or visiting researcher or visiting scientist may perform research related to the University\u2019s portion of a small business\u2019 SBIR award, and concurrently serve as an employee or intern of that small business.\nIf a small business applicant for an SBIR award might require a license from the University for intellectual property prior to commencing research under the SBIR award, the University requires that the small business promptly contact the University\u2019s Office of Technology Management sufficiently in advance of submitting its proposal to the sponsoring agency, in order to discuss the availability of relevant intellectual property and whether a license is needed.\nNo University Personnel may utilize their position at the University to influence or participate on behalf of a small business in making business decisions, or negotiating agreements, between that outside entity and the University.\nShould any violation or potential violation of these principles arise or be discovered at any time after the application for and\/or award of SBIR-funded research, it is the obligation of the Investigator who discovers or becomes aware of such violation or potential violation to notify immediately the Office for Research Protections so that appropriate remedial action, if necessary, can be taken.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research, or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may also apply, especially:\nAC80 -

The Act provides that, upon the completion of a degree program, the alien is to promptly depart from the United States. However, the Act provides that an alien student may request permission to accept employment in order to obtain practical training. Practical training is not a necessary part of a foreign student's educational process in the United States and permission may be denied. Practical Training will be denied if the Immigration Service determines that the alien is being employed rather than performing duties of a training nature.\nCRITERIA FOR PRACTICAL TRAINING:\nThe following criteria for practical training must be met:\nSuch practical training must be recommended by a person so authorized by the University, and\nThe proposed training must be in the student's field of study.\nPermission for employment will not be granted until the student has completed all requirements for the degree sought, including any dissertations required, and\nA certifying University official must describe the duties to be performed and provide a plausible explanation as to why such training is not available to the student in the student's country of residence.\nAPPLICATION FOR PRACTICAL TRAINING:\nIt shall be the responsibility of the alien student to request an application for practical training from the appropriate International Student Affairs office at the institution at which the course of study was completed.That office has the responsibility of determining that the student is eligible to apply, and that the proposed training is in the student's field of study. The application for practical training shall be submitted to the Regional Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service having jurisdiction over the educational institution.\nPERIODS OF EMPLOYMENT:\nPermission to accept temporary employment to obtain practical training may be granted in increments of not more than 6 months each for a maximum of not more than 12 months in the aggregate for a foreign national on a F-1 visa, or not more than 18 months in the aggregate for a foreign national on a J-1 visa. However, if the course of study is completed in less than the 12 month or 18 month periods, the maximum period may not exceed the length of the course of study.\nREQUESTS FOR EXTENSION OF PRACTICAL TRAINING:\nSubsequent applications to continue employment for practical training shall consist of:\nAn extension of stay form obtained from and signed by the appropriate International Student Affairs office at the institution in which the course of study was completed, and\nA supporting letter from the employing department stating that the duties being performed are training and describing the duties.\nEach period of practical training is reviewed on an individual basis by the appropriate Immigration and Naturalization Office. Subsequent applications to continue practical training are increasingly difficult to obtain. Approval of one period does not guarantee approval of subsequent requests. Applications for an extension of stay for practical training are filed with the district office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service having jurisdiction over the place where training is being conducted.\nCONCLUSION OF PRACTICAL TRAINING:\nWhen an alien has completed the maximum of two periods of practical training (F-1), or three periods of practical training (J-1), he\/she is expected to return home to utilize the education and training received in the United States. Further offers of University employment should be discouraged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide information concerning the employment of foreign students by the University."},{"university":"psu","name":"fn09","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholarships | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesScholarships \n\n\n\nFinancial Policies\n\nFN09\nScholarships\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nOffice of the Corporate Controller>\nContents\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nStudent Eligibility \nOverawards\nSelection\/Awarding\nTiming of Awards\nScholarship\/Award\/Grant Contributions\nProcessing Scholarship\/Award\/Grant Monies \nDisbursement to Students\nResponsibilities\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS:\n1) UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS\/AWARDS (USCH)\nUniversity Scholarships\/Awards (USCH) are awarded to students by campus, college, and administrative unit scholarship\/award committees. Qualified recipients are selected from a pool of students who meet particular scholarship\/award criteria. The primary characteristic of a University scholarship\/award lies in the individual selection of qualified students from a larger eligible student pool. University scholarship\/award sources fall into one of three categories: a) ENDOWED University scholarship\/award sources established primarily by private donors; b) ANNUALLY FUNDED University scholarship\/award sources established by private donors; c) INSTITUTIONAL University scholarship\/award sources established by campuses, colleges, or administrative units of the University for the purpose of making scholarships\/awards.\na) ENDOWED \nEndowed University scholarships\/awards are established with cash gifts or the fair market value of securities which are used to buy units in the University investment pool. Annual spending is determined by the number of units and spending per unit. Endowed University scholarship\/award sources are established and monitored by the University according to the official guidelines and are reported to the Board of Trustees (See  FN15 for the policy on establishing such scholarships\/awards.). Funds for this purpose are received, deposited, and processed according to Policy  FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 (FNG01). Endowed University scholarship\/award sources are assigned endowment accounts.\nThe University has established different types of endowed University scholarships\/awards. Any exceptions to the specific criteria for each type of scholarship must be approved by the Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations:\nAcademic Excellence Scholarships are University scholarships designed for the recruitment of high caliber students for the Schreyer Honors College. A freshman student accepted into the Schreyer Honors College automatically receives the Academic Excellence Scholarship. This scholarship is a four-year award, provided recipients continue to meet the required Honors College program requirements. New scholarship support for Schreyer Honors Students is established as Honors Scholarships (see below).\nAlumni Association Chapter Scholarships are University scholarships designed to recognize and support students from an Alumni Association Chapter\u2019s geographic region. Chapters raise funds that create endowed or annually funded University scholarships. The minimum endowment level for an Alumni Association Chapter Scholarship is $50,000.\nAthletic Scholarships are University scholarships designed to provide recognition and financial assistance to undergraduate students who are outstanding NCAA Division I student-athletes. The minimum endowment level for an Athletic Scholarship is $50,000. The Athletic Department also offers a donor the opportunity to endow a position in a sport (i.e., quarterback, forward). The minimum endowment level for a position Athletic Scholarship is $300,000.\nNOTE: \u2018Athletic Grant-in-Aid\u2019 is a term used by the NCAA to refer to a student\u2019s athletic scholarship(s). At Penn State, athletes are awarded private donor endowed or annually funded scholarships that provide their \u2018Athletic Grant-in-Aid.\u2019\nAwards are designed to provide recognition to students who exemplify a singular accomplishment that all students have the opportunity to achieve (i.e., acceptance into a major, academic merit, exceptional leadership). Award guideline criteria cannot and do not include preferences or eligibility requirements that are outside a student\u2019s control (i.e., diversity factors, gender, financial need). The minimum endowment level for an Award is $20,000.\nDestiny Scholarships are University Scholarships designed for first generation students who are often unfamiliar with the financial aid process and who show academic promise, but are historically less likely to enter college and graduate with a college degree without significant financial assistance. The minimum endowment level for a Destiny Scholarship is $50,000.\nEnrichment Scholarships are University scholarships designed, to the extent permitted by law, to promote a diverse and supportive environment for all individuals within the student body, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or other personal characteristics. Enrichment Scholarships demonstrate a donor\u2019s and the University\u2019s commitment to diversity and the belief that a diverse student body and faculty enhance the rigor, quality, and energy of the educational experience. The minimum endowment level for an Enrichment Scholarship is $50,000.\nUndergraduate Scholarships are University scholarships designed according to a donor\u2019s interests and\/or preference(s) for a particular campus, college, geographic area, academic merit, financial need, or any number of other eligibility specifications consistent with University policy. Each Undergraduate Scholarship has a specific and formal name chosen by the donor, distinguishing the scholarship\u2019s purpose. The minimum endowment level for a Undergraduate Scholarship is $50,000. Undergraduate scholarships designed for program support as well as student scholarship support (hybrid) will have a minimum endowment level of $50,000.\nGraduate Scholarships are University scholarships designed according to a donor\u2019s interests and\/or preference(s) for a particular campus, college, geographic area, academic merit, financial need, or any number of other eligibility specifications consistent with University policy. Each Graduate Scholarship has a specific and formal name chosen by the donor, distinguishing the scholarship\u2019s purpose. The minimum endowment level for a Graduate Scholarship is $250,000.\nScholarships that are designed to support both Graduate and Undergraduate students must have a minimum endowment level of $250,000.\n\"Combination\" Scholarships are those scholarships available for both graduate and undergraduate students. They are University scholarships designed according to a donor\u2019s interests and\/or preference(s) for a particular campus, college, geographic area, academic merit, financial need, or any number of other eligibility specifications consistent with University policy. Each Scholarship has a specific and formal name chosen by the donor, distinguishing the scholarship\u2019s purpose. The minimum endowment level for a Combination Scholarship is $250,000.\nHonors Scholarships are University Scholarships that are unique to the Schreyer Honors College, developed by the Honors College alone or developed by academic colleges in partnership with the Schreyer Honors College to recruit and\/or to recognize the academic merit and academic achievements of high caliber students enrolling or enrolled in the Schreyer Honors College. If the endowment is created as a partnership between an academic college and the Honors College, the college and Honors awarding units consult with one another to select recipients. The minimum endowment level for an Honors Scholarship is $50,000.\nRenaissance Scholarships are University scholarships designed for top students who have the greatest financial need. These scholarships are four-year awards, provided recipients continue to meet the academic merit and financial need requirements of the program. Renaissance Scholarships are equitably awarded across all undergraduate campuses. The program is under the oversight of the Renaissance Fund Board. The minimum endowment level for a Renaissance Scholarship is $30,000. \nTrustee Scholarships are University scholarships designed to provide financial assistance to undergraduate students who demonstrate the greatest financial need. High academic achievement is not a requirement. Donors may specify a campus or a college and one eligibility preference. The Trustee Matching Scholarship Program uses University funds in perpetuity to increase the impact of private philanthropy. A donor completes a pledge form and signs scholarship guidelines. The University \u201cmatches\u201d these gifts by agreeing to add to the donor\u2019s endowment spending account on an annual basis an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the donor\u2019s pledged amount so that the match and the endowment earnings can be awarded in the donor\u2019s name. This match will continue in perpetuity. Subsequent gifts to the endowment will also be matched in this manner until such time as the University\u2019s matching funds are fully committed. The campus, college, or administrative unit assigned to the management of the endowment chooses recipients from a pool of qualified students identified by the Office of Student Aid. The minimum endowment level for a Trustee Scholarship is $100,000.\nNOTE: Scholarships solely designed to support students pursuing J.D. or M.D. degrees have a minimum endowment level of $50,000, as opposed to a minimum endowment level of $250,000 for Graduate Scholarships.\nb) ANNUALLY FUNDED \nPrivate donor annually funded University scholarship\/award sources are established with monetary gifts contributed annually for a period of at least five years. Like endowed scholarship\/award sources, annually funded University scholarship\/award sources are established and monitored by the University according to the donor's guidelines and are reported to the Board of Trustees (See  FN15 for the policy on establishing such scholarships.). Funds for this purpose are received, deposited, and processed according to Policy  FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 (FNG01). Annually funded University scholarship\/award sources are assigned annually funded accounts.\nThe Office of University Development has established different types of private donor annually funded scholarships\/awards that correspond in gift commitments to the Alumni Association, Award, Destiny, Enrichment, General, and Honors Scholarship endowment levels noted above. A donor must contribute at least 5% of the minimum endowment level of any one of these endowment types and make a commitment to contribute that 5% annual amount for at least five years.\nc) INSTITUTIONAL \nInstitutional University scholarship\/award sources are established with monies allocated by a campus, college, or administrative unit of the University for the purpose of making scholarships\/awards, and can include general fund sources (permanent or temporary). These University scholarship\/award sources must have established criteria that have been developed by the campus, college, or administrative area allocating the funds and approved by the Provost or his\/her designee. These criteria are not subject to approval by the Board of Trustees.\nInstitutional scholarships managed by the colleges and campuses using general fund sources must be accounted for through 06-088-NN XX.\nThese scholarships will post initially to the Internal Scholarship account \u2013 06-090-NN XX 19800 with an assigned source code of IGFXX and then will be journal vouchered by the Financial Officer or delegate to the 06-088 \u2013NN XX 10010 account using object code 0420.\nAnnual reporting on Institutional Support awards for each campus, college and administrative area is required to assure appropriate accountability for the use of general fund sources. The Budget Executive will submit the report to the Provost Office as requested.\nInstitutional University scholarship\/award sources include, but are not limited to, the Internal Scholarship (INTXX or IGFXX) sources created for each campus, college, and administrative unit and awarded by these units; the University Trustee Scholarship and the Bunton-Waller Scholarship, awarded by the Office of Student Aid; the Chancellor\u2019s Award, awarded by the Undergraduate Office of Admissions and select campuses; the Chancellor\u2019s Scholarship-Behrend; the World Campus Scholarship.\n2) INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS (GRNT) \nInstitutional Grant funds are allocated annually by the University\u2019s central administration and provide financial support to eligible students. For some Institutional Grant funds, an entire cohort of eligible students is identified and all eligible students are awarded. For other Institutional Grant funds, an entire cohort of eligible students is identified and grants are awarded until funds are exhausted.\nInstitutional Grants include, but are not limited to, the Penn State Tuition Grant, Resident Assistant Housing Grant, professional development grant, and tuition waivers.\n3) OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS (OSCH)\nOutside Scholarships are funded by a third party sponsor. A third-party sponsor is an entity that has agreed to pay all or a specified portion of a student or a group of students\u2019 tuition, fees, books and other charges. Penn State requires a sponsor to provide an official document guaranteeing payment (i.e., letter, agreement, contract, certification, application). Some sponsors are invoiced directly for the charges they have agreed to pay; however, most sponsors do not require an invoice. The liability for payment of tuition and fees ultimately lies with the student if a sponsor fails to pay all amounts as agreed. Funds for outside scholarships may be received by Student Financial Services, World Campus, the Office of International Programs, and campuses. Funds are deposited and processed according to Policy  FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 (FNG01).\nOutside third-party sponsors may include, but are not limited to, corporations, employers, school districts, trade unions, foundations, tribes, clubs, charitable organizations, and foreign governments.\nNOTE: For all Endowed, Annually Funded, and Institutional University scholarship\/award sources, as well as all Institutional Grant and Outside Scholarship sources, Student Financial Services assigns source coding that identifies the origin, purpose, and\/or management of these funds.\nStudent Financial Services and the Office of Student Aid have created a definition grid that serves as the official guide for defining and coding sources in the Integrated Student Information System (ISIS). Student Financial Services is charged with accurately defining and coding accounts.\nSTUDENT ELIGIBILITY:\n1) UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS\/AWARDS (USCH)\nStudent eligibility for a) Endowed and b) Annually Funded  University scholarships\/awards established by private donors is determined per the guidelines approved by both the donor and the University Board of Trustees. In contrast, student eligibility for c) Institutional University scholarships\/awards established by campuses, colleges, or administrative units is determined per the guideline criteria developed and agreed upon by the campus, the college, or the administrative unit allocating the funds.\n*Unless University Scholarship\/Award guidelines specify otherwise, a scholarship\/award recipient must be a degree-seeking Penn State student. \nAn undergraduate scholarship\/award recipient must be enrolled in Penn State course credits during the awarded semester when the University scholarship\/award guideline agreement specifies enrollment. Although the focus of awarding should be to award University scholarships\/awards to students enrolled in course credits during the awarded semester, students who are not enrolled may be awarded a University scholarship\/award where the guideline agreement has no enrollment requirement. In those cases it is imperative for awarding staff to ensure that recipients are in good academic standing with the University and intend to continue their education at their Penn State campus and\/or college of enrollment.\nFor  graduate-level scholarship\/award eligibility, eligible recipients must be degree-seeking students enrolled in the Graduate School and registered for Penn State course credits or actively engaged in research\/scholarship during the awarded semester.\u00a0 Guideline agreements that do not require an enrollment status should include the verbiage \u201c. . . regardless of enrollment status, so long as the recipient is in good academic standing and intends to continue their education at the . . . Campus or in the College of . . . at the Pennsylvania State University.\u201d\nThe University\u2019s corresponding definitions of enrolled full-time, enrolled half-time, or enrolled part-time are the following: \nUndergraduate Students\nAll calculations apply to fall, spring, and summer.\nFull-time \u2013 12 or more enrolled credits\nHalf-time \u2013 6 to 11.5 enrolled credits\nPart-time \u2013 less than 6 enrolled credits\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, undergraduate students on co-op or internship are not considered full-time unless they are enrolled in 12 or more credits.\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, students approved for concurrent enrollment in the undergraduate\/graduate integrated program are identified and reported as undergraduate students. Therefore, their enrolled credits are defined at the undergraduate level.\nGraduate Students\nAll calculations apply to fall, spring, and summer. It is recognized that graduate students may be fully engaged in their programs and working toward degree completion in accordance with published programmatic requirements but not registered for credit. Scholarship awarding during such periods of non-registration requires confirmation of current, active engagement in research\/scholarship and academic progress.\u00a0 Confirmation will be entered by the awarding unit in eSteward and confirmed by the Graduate School.\nFull-time \u2013 9 or more enrolled credits\nHalf-time \u2013 5 to 8.5 enrolled credits\nPart-time \u2013 less than 5 enrolled credits\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, graduate students enrolled in Ph.D. dissertation 601 or 611 are considered full-time or half-time respectively.\nStudy Abroad Students\nAll calculations apply to fall, spring, and summer.\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, students participating in a Penn State study abroad program are enrolled in credits. Depending on their level of enrollment (undergraduate\/graduate) and their number of enrolled credits, students are considered full-time, half-time, or part-time.\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, students participating in a non-Penn State study abroad program have no enrolled credits and therefore, no Penn State enrollment status.\nThe University expects University-managed scholarships to be awarded to students participating in Penn State programs.\nLaw Students\nAll calculations apply to fall, spring, and summer.\nFull-time \u2013 12 or more enrolled credits\nHalf-time \u2013 6 to 11.5 enrolled credits\nPart-time \u2013 less than 6 enrolled credits\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, law students enrolled in a J.D.\/Ph.D. program taking dissertation 601 are considered full-time.\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, students approved for joint-degree enrollment in a law\/graduate program are identified and reported as either law or graduate depending on their current year curriculum. Therefore, their enrolled credits are calculated at the level of their enrollment in a given year (J.D. \u2013 FT at 12 credits; Ph.D. \u2013 FT at 9 credits).\nMedical Students\nAll calculations apply to fall, spring, and summer.\nFull-time \u2013 1 or more enrolled credits\nFor scholarship\/award eligibility, medical students enrolled in an M.D.\/Ph.D. program taking dissertation 601 are considered full-time.\n*If University Scholarship or Institutional Scholarship\/Award guidelines\u00a0specify demonstrated, proven or documented financial need, a scholarship\/award recipient must demonstrate financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n*University employees receiving educational privileges are not eligible for University scholarships\/awards, with the exception of endowed\/annually funded sources specifically established for the benefit of employees. See HR36 and HR38 for details. \n2) INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS (GRNT)\nStudent eligibility for Institutional Grants is determined by the Office of Student Aid and the Office of the Bursar in consultation with central administration.\n3) OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS (OSCH)\nStudent eligibility for Outside Scholarships is determined by the sponsor, per the instructions specified in the documentation provided by the sponsor.\nOVERAWARDS:\nAll scholarships\/awards and grants issued to a student via eSteward or the Integrated Student Information System (ISIS) must be validated through ISIS, as awards are subject to review by the Office of Student Aid to determine the cause and resolution of over award situations involving federal and state financial aid. Adjustments of financial aid must be resolved when financial aid is in excess of financial need, the cost of attendance, gift-aid budget allowances, etc. Beyond promoting general accountability, over award resolution is necessary to substantiate compliance with federal and\/or state aid programs, as required by the appropriate federal or state agency.\nPrior to the disbursement of any refund, a student's account must be checked for an over award situation. Even if it is subsequently discovered that an over award situation was not corrected properly or if the over award was not determined in time to correct a late award, regardless of when aid was received, a student recipient is required to make immediate repayment.\nSELECTION\/AWARDING:\nScholarship\/award committees at each campus and in each college and administrative unit must follow established, written procedures which they have developed, and which specify standards they are using when selecting eligible recipients and awarding scholarships\/awards.\neSteward and the Integrated Student Information System (ISIS) provide the platform for the coordination, validation, and entry of scholarships\/awards onto student accounts. eSteward \"eligible-student\" searches, based on individual scholarship\/award guideline criteria, provide the starting point for identifying qualified recipients. eSteward and ISIS provide the ability to post and monitor scholarships\/awards and recipients. Appropriate award letters that define the terms of scholarships\/awards should be prepared and distributed after final ISIS validation.\nNOTE: IRS regulations prohibit a donor from selecting scholarship\/award recipients for University scholarships\/awards. To make a charitable donation, donors must give up all rights to the property or cash given. Retaining a right to appoint gift usage is inconsistent with this principal. In order to receive a charitable contribution, a donor's gift must be out of \"detached and disinterested\" generosity. Retaining a right to select who uses the gift funds may indicate that there is a personal benefit in making the gift which would be inconsistent with a charitable donation.\nEXCEPTIONS: Any exceptions to the awarding of scholarships\/awards beyond the parameters specified in this policy must be articulated and discussed with a unit\u2019s Stewardship Coordinator, the Director of Stewardship, Student Financial Services, and if need be, the Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations.\nTIMING OF AWARDS:\nAwarding of University scholarships\/awards and grants can begin as soon as the upcoming fiscal year Available Spending is populated in ISIS and eSteward. Awarding units are expected to coordinate first-year and continuing student awarding with the Office of Student Aid\u2019s financial aid awarding in March for first-year students and in June for continuing students. The appropriate unit staff member(s) shall monitor accounts throughout the year so that unspent and newly available monies may be identified and subsequently awarded in a timely manner. If available monies remain unspent at fiscal year-end, the appropriate unit staff member(s) shall determine why monies were unspent and what plans are in place to ensure future expenditures.\n1) UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS\/AWARDS (USCH)\na) ENDOWED:  In February of each year, Student Financial Services estimates the available spending for endowed University scholarship\/award sources for the following academic year. For a given endowed scholarship, the available spending may increase throughout the year as additional gifts are received. The available spending can be viewed on ISIS screen AFWB, in eSteward, in EASIS, and on Student Aid Fund Balance Reports.\nb) ANNUALLY FUNDED:  In February of each year, Student Financial Services populates the available spending for annually funded University scholarship\/award sources for the following academic year. Because gift amounts for Annually Funded University scholarships may vary from year to year, the available spending on ISIS screen AFWB displays \u201c99999999\u201d for all annually funded sources. It is the awarding unit\u2019s responsibility to monitor annually funded sources so that budgets are not overspent at the fiscal year\u2019s end. eSteward displays the actual IBIS account balance to assist awarding units as they monitor annually funded account balances. Awarding units must communicate with donors in order to identify how much gift money their annually funded sources can expect to receive each year.\nEXCEPTION: Please see the \"Processing Scholarship\/Award\/Grant Monies\"section for the exception related to awarding new annually funded or early activated accounts that are not yet funded due to 90-day gift holding. \nc) INSTITUTIONAL:  At an awarding unit\u2019s request, Student Financial Services populates the available spending on ISIS screen AFWB. Due to the limited duration of these aid sources and the varying amounts of monies available to award, awarding units must provide annually to Student Financial Services the amounts available to award for each of their institutional scholarship\/award sources.\nEXCEPTION: For Internal (INTXX or IGFXX) scholarship\/award sources, in February of each year, Student Financial Services populates the available spending on ISIS screen AFWB with \u201c999999999\u201d for all Internal scholarship\/award sources (INTXX or IGFXX). Populating AFWB in this manner allows awarding units to post awards from Internal sources (INTXX or IGFXX) before the supporting funds have been transferred into the corresponding IBIS accounts. It is the awarding unit\u2019s responsibility to monitor their Internal scholarship\/award source (INTXX or IGFXX) and to make sure that the corresponding IBIS account ends the fiscal year with a zero balance. eSteward displays the actual IBIS account balance to assist awarding units as they monitor Internal (INTXX or IGFXX) scholarship\/award account balances.\n2) INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS (GRNT) \nAt an awarding unit\u2019s request, Student Financial Services or the Office of the Bursar populates the Amount Available on ISIS screen AFWB for all Institutional grants. Due to the limited duration of these aid sources and the varying amount of monies available to award, awarding units must provide annually to Student Financial Services or the Office of the Bursar the available spending for each of their Institutional grants.\n3) OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS (OSCH)\nOutside scholarships are awarded as documentation and\/or checks are received by Student Financial Services, World Campus, the Office of International Programs, and individual campuses.\nSCHOLARSHIP\/AWARD\/GRANT CONTRIBUTIONS:\nIt is imperative that contributions received for scholarships\/awards are deposited and recorded as quickly as possible upon receipt, in accordance with Policy  FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 (FNG01). Recorded contributions are subsequently transferred to the appropriate and unique scholarship\/award account in the administrative area responsible for processing the student scholarships\/awards.\n1) UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS\/AWARDS (USCH)\nStudent Financial Services and the Office of the Bursar are responsible for creating unique accounts for each campus, college, and administrative unit\u2019s\u00a0University scholarship\/award sources, to which scholarship\/award contributions are designated before they are awarded and disbursed.\na) CASH or CHECKS: Any cash or checks received for scholarships\/awards should be taken to the appropriate administrative unit office for preparation of a Gift Reporting and Transmittal (GRT) Form AND Report of Cash Receipts, in accordance with Policy  FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 (FNG01).\nb) SECURITIES: Most securities are received via wire transfer; however, any paper stock certificates\/securities that are received must be carried to the Office of Gift Planning immediately upon receipt, with a completed Gift Reporting and Transmittal (GRT)  form. The Office of Gift Planning will subsequently initiate the acknowledgment of receipt of the securities. The Office of Gift Planning will transmit the actual securities, GRT and all support documents to the Office of Investment Management, per Financial Guideline No. 01 (FNG01).\nAt other campuses where hand-carrying is not possible, this material must be forwarded to the Office of Gift Planning via Registered U. S. Mail. The Office of Gift Planning will subsequently transmit these materials to the Office of Investment Management.\n2) INSTITUTIONAL GRANTS (GRNT)\nStudent Financial Services and the Office of the Bursar are responsible for creating unique accounts for each campus, college, and administrative unit\u2019s institutional grant sources, to which grant contributions are designated before they are awarded and disbursed. \u00a0\n3) OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS (OSCH)\nWith the exception of World Campus and the Office of International Programs, all funds and supporting documents received at University Park must be forwarded, upon receipt, to Student Financial Services for Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) preparation and deposit to the appropriate University depository account. At campuses other than University Park, processing must be conducted in accordance with Policy  FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 (FNG01).\nPROCESSING SCHOLARSHIP\/AWARD\/GRANT MONIES:\n1) UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS\/AWARDS (USCH)\nStudent Financial Services and the Office of the Bursar are responsible for creating unique source codes for each campus, college, and administrative unit\u2019s University scholarship\/award source accounts, from which scholarships\/awards are awarded and disbursed.\nThe awarding unit posts a scholarship\/award to the account of the selected student via on-line entry to the appropriate ISIS or eSteward screen. In the case of travel awards or research expenditures, see policy FN10.\nScholarships\/awards must be posted to the unique source code created for the specific scholarship\/award source account from which the scholarships\/awards are disbursed.\nFor endowed\/non-endowed scholarship\/award sources used for student travel and research expenditures- See policy FN10  for details.\nEXCEPTION- New Annually Funded \/Early Activated Accounts: For new annually funded or early activated accounts that are not yet funded due to 90-day gift holding, awards may be made from another account in advance of receiving the held gifts. The following stipulations apply to this processing exception:\nExecuted guidelines must already exist for the new account.\nUnit awarding staff must take necessary steps to ensure that students awarded via the alternate account meet the awarding criteria of the new account.\nThe unit must follow proper procedure to replace student awards with the correct new account source code once held gift money becomes available for expenditure.\nEXCEPTION- Internal Scholarships: A campus, college, or administrative unit completes a Scholarship Award Form for each scholarship\/award awarded from their Internal scholarship source (INTXX). The completed Scholarship Award Form is approved by the appropriate unit official. Upon approval, the original copy of the Scholarship Award Form is forwarded to the authorized ISIS entry person in the awarding unit who posts the scholarship\/award in ISIS or eSteward. A copy of the Scholarship Award Form is sent to the awarding unit\u2019s Finance Office.

In most cases these plans will consist of business continuity plans, but other plans may be required as applicable.\nAn Emergency is defined as an event (expected or unexpected) that places life, property, or the environment in danger, and requires more than the routine public safety response.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nThe Office of Emergency Management, under the direction of the Assistant Vice President for Public Safety and Police Services, is responsible for:\nDeveloping, updating and exercising the overall University Emergency Operations Plan;\nOverseeing and coordinating emergency planning, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts at all locations;\nEducating the community on how to best protect themselves by following all applicable regulations and best practices;\nFacilitating exercises, and coordinating drills in support of the plans;\nNotifying the community upon declaration of a state of emergency, including appropriate external Emergency Management Agencies; maintaining the University\u2019s Emergency Operations Center; and supporting the Emergency Management Core Team; and,\nCoordinating centralized resources with responsible personnel at locations away from University Park if an emergency is declared affecting those units.\nThe Senior Vice President for Finance and Business, the President, Provost and the Vice President for Administration, shall constitute the Emergency Management Executive Policy Group and provide subject matter policy and direction for the entire University.\u00a0The Policy Group is also responsible for informing the Board of Trustees and providing timely status reports, as appropriate.

The Associate Vice President for Research and Director of Strategic Initiatives (AVPR-DSI), in close communication with the colleges\/institutes, is charged with implementing the process. For specific programs that are related to undergraduate education, the Office of Undergraduate Education is charged with implementing the process and follows other procedures. The Office of the Vice President for Research also works closely with the Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations when the funding opportunity originates from a private foundation.\nIt is the responsibility of the faculty or their college\/institute to contact limitedsubs@psu.edu if they identify a limited submission opportunity and want to pursue it. Faculty should not proceed with a response to a limited submission opportunity without their college\/institute obtaining approval from the Office of the Vice President for Research by contacting limitedsubs@psu.edu and pursuing the process outlined below.\n PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING INTEREST IN LIMITED SUBMISSION OPPORTUNITIES:\nLimited submission opportunities are identified in several ways, i.e., from invitations, funding agency announcements, national mailing lists, and faculty\/research administrators. Limited submission opportunities are handled in one of two ways, depending on the likely level of faculty interest, but, as noted above, proposal submission for any limited submission opportunity requires approval from Office of the Vice President for Research.\nFor those limited submission opportunities that are likely to be of interest to multiple faculty, the Office of the Vice President for Research will notify the research community and perform a downselect as detailed in the next section.\nFor those limited submission opportunities that are new or are targeted at relatively narrow fields of interest, the Office of the Vice President for Research will rely on the relevant administrative units to identify the opportunities which are appropriate for their faculty. A faculty member wanting to compete for an opportunity in this category must notify his\/her college research dean or institute director and the Office of the Vice President for Research at limitedsubs@psu.edu\u00a0at least two months prior to the sponsor's deadline for proposal submission. This will allow the Office of the Vice President for Research to determine the need for an internal downselect and conduct one if needed. Faculty who do not notify the Office of the Vice President for Research two months prior to the sponsor's deadline will not be guaranteed consideration in an internal downselect.\n  DOWNSELECT PROCESS:\nThe following limited submissions process is followed in most cases where a downselect decision is required. Exceptions are made in certain situations, for example, when the deadline is short, when the program is highly focused, or when a strategic interest of the University is impacted.\nUNIVERSITY ANNOUNCEMENT: Website postings and e-mail announcements are issued from the Office of the Vice President for Research to the URC, or a URC subset in the case of a program that has a very specific target audience, with copies to the Administrative Committee on Research providing a brief summary of the program, website location, timeline for response, pre-proposal\/ information requirements, and submission deadlines.\nCOLLEGE\/INSTITUTE ANNOUNCEMENT: URC members share e-mail announcements with their department heads and faculty.\nNOTICE-OF-INTENT: If a substantial response is anticipated, interested faculty are asked to submit a notice-of-intent to Office of the Vice President for Research, following the instructions on the announcement memo. This notice includes the name and title of the principal investigator and co-investigators, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and planned pre-proposal title. The primary purpose of the notice-of-intent is to enable the rapid initiation of the pre-proposal review process.\nPRE-PROPOSAL APPLICATION: Each faculty member who submits a notice-of-intent must submit an electronic pre-proposal application by the stated deadline, following the instructions on the announcement memo.\nSELECTION ADVISORY PANEL: The AVPR-DSI identifies a selection advisory panel based on the notices-of-intent to ensure the appropriate expertise is represented on the panel. For research proposals, panels are comprised primarily of research deans and institute directors representative of appropriate disciplines along with faculty identified by the research deans. In cooperation with colleges\/institutes, additional faculty may be recruited to serve on the panels in order to provide specialized expertise. For individual fellowships (such as from the Packard Foundation), faculty who have previously been awardees are typically invited to serve as panel members.\nSELECTION PROCESS: With staff support from the Office of the Vice President for Research, selection advisory panel members access, review, and rank the pre-proposals, and may meet to discuss the combined rankings. The panel should aim to determine which pre-proposal teams will have the best chance of success in external competition, and should also consider which pre-proposals are best aligned with the University's strategic goals. The recommendations are forwarded to the AVPR-DSI, who makes the final decision for the Office of the Vice President for Research in consultation with the VPR. Panel members are encouraged to provide written feedback to be shared with faculty, along with any informal feedback that may be helpful to formulating a final decision. Every attempt is taken to ensure that panel deliberations and final decisions are completed in a timely fashion, thereby optimizing the time available to the faculty for preparation of the final proposal.\nSELECTION NOTIFICATION: The Office of the Vice President for Research electronically notifies the appropriate URC members who then notify the faculty of the decision. The Office of the Vice President for Research also sends the URC members written feedback as provided by the panel.\nFACULTY RESPONSIBILTY:  Once a faculty member is selected to apply for a specific limited submission opportunity, s\/he has the responsibility to submit to that program by the designated deadline and to work with the appropriate administrative units within the University to prepare the best possible proposal. If a faculty member decides to decline the selection, s\/he must notify limitedsubs@psu.edu as soon as possible to permit another faculty member to compete externally.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tPublished Date: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This guideline (previously RAG19) has been edited to reflect current practice.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 19, 2012 - Editorial changes.

These complex rules and regulations may impact significant portions of the efforts of University faculty, staff and students as they pursue the research, academic and\/or business goals of the institution. In considering the potential impact of Export Controls on University activities, it is important to remember that the term \"Export\", as used in these laws and regulations, is very broadly defined to encompass many activities, such as the mere access to controlled information, materials or equipment by Foreign Persons in the United States, not typically considered to be an export.\nPOLICY:\nIn accordance with\u00a0AD88, it is the policy of the University to comply with all applicable U.S. laws, including any and all relevant and applicable laws, regulations or guidelines governing the export of goods, information or services.\u00a0 To facilitate such compliance, the University has directed and empowered the University Export Compliance Officer (\"UECO\") to develop and maintain an export compliance management program that is designed to assist University employees, faculty, students, trainees, visiting scientists, and other persons (herein referred to as \"University Persons\") in conducting all University activities in accordance with USG Export Controls.\nSpecifically, University Persons may not engage in any of the following potentially export controlled activities, unless authorized in advance as noted below:\nEngage in any action, activity or conduct prohibited by the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) or the Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) regulations, or any other government agency regulations or guidelines designated for the enforcement of applicable export laws;\nTransfer, release or provide access to any controlled item listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) or United States Munitions List (USML), including, but not limited to, any controlled technology and technical data, to any Foreign Person without the prior review and written approval of the UECO; or,\nUndertake any Foreign Transaction in association with any Embargoed Destination or Restricted Party\/Person without the prior review and written approval of the UECO.\nDeterminations concerning the application of, and ability to comply with, any relevant USG Export Controls may be obtained by requesting an export review to be completed by the UECO, or, for sponsored research activities subject to\u00a0RA40\u00a0and\/or\u00a0RAG40, by contacting the Office of Sponsored Programs.\u00a0 Such determinations, at a minimum, must be completed prior to any of the following Foreign Transactions:\nTraveling internationally;\nEngaging in science or technology-based research which involves the direct or indirect participation of any Foreign Persons, including any access to or use of research facilities by Foreign Persons as part of the research efforts;\nExecuting contracts or other agreements with Foreign Persons or which contain specific export compliance obligations,\nPurchasing of any high-technology devices or software, or\nEngaging in any other activity that may be directly affected by specific and identified USG Export Controls.\nUSG Export Controls are subject to change at the discretion of the USG agencies tasked with enforcement of these complex laws. It is the duty of all University Persons to be constantly evaluating their activities against the current policies and procedures of the University as they apply to USG Export Controls.\u00a0 Assistance from the UECO, including targeted training and educational resources designed to help University Persons keep current with current export compliance procedures and obligations of the University, is available upon request.\nQuestions regarding export compliance at the University may be directed to the UECO, in the University Office of Ethics and Compliance, via email correspondence addressed to\u00a0Export@psu.edu.\u00a0 Additional information about export compliance in general may be found at the UECO\u00a0website.\nPROCEDURES:\nCurrent procedures for review and\/or approval of any Foreign Transaction may be found at the University Export Compliance Office website and in\u00a0ADG09\u00a0\u2013 Export Compliance Definitions, Procedures and Implementation Guidelines.\u00a0 Additional guidance, direction or assistance regarding any such current procedures may be obtained from the UECO and\/or the University's Empowered Officials.\u00a0 Use of any forms provided to facilitate such reviews is recommended to enable timely and consistent review of all impacted Foreign Transactions.\u00a0 Training on current procedures is available by contacting the UECO at\u00a0Export@psu.edu.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the UECO at Export@psu.edu.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD67\u00a0- Disclosure of Wrongful Conduct and Protection From Retaliation\n AD88\u00a0- Code of Responsible Conduct\n ADG09\u00a0\u2013 Export Compliance Definitions, Procedures and Implementation Guidelines\u00a0\n RA40\u00a0- Compliance with Federal Export Regulations for Sponsored Research Efforts\nRAG40\u00a0- Guidelines for Ensuring Compliance with Export Control Policy RA40\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 22, 2015 - New policy.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nJune 15, 2015>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nJune 22, 2015>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nJune 22, 2015>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish the parameters for compliance with the various federal laws, regulations and guidelines commonly referred to as \"Export Controls\" in all operations of the University, including research, academic and general business activities."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad66","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Animal Policy | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesService Animal Policy \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD66\nService Animal Policy\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nUnder Review>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nScope\nPolicy\nDefinition\nWhen Service Animals May Be Removed or Prohibited In a Facility or Program\nRequests for Accomodations\nStudents\nEmployees\nVisitors\n\nRequirements for Service Animals\nOther Resources\nCross References\n\n\nSCOPE:\nThis policy applies to all facilities owned, leased and\/or under the control of The Pennsylvania State University excluding Hershey Medical Center, the College of Medicine, and the Pennsylvania College of Technology.\u00a0\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of the University that service animals assisting individuals with disabilities are generally permitted in all facilities and programs, except as described below.\nDEFINITION:\n\u201cService animal\u201d is defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended (ADA), as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to: guiding individuals with impaired vision; alerting individuals with impaired hearing to intruders or sounds; providing minimal protection or rescue work; pulling a wheelchair; or fetching dropped items. (28 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 36, Subpart A \u2013 General, 36.104 Definitions).\nIf they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ADA, regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government.\nWHEN SERVICE ANIMALS MAY BE REMOVED OR PROHIBITED FROM A FACILITY OR PROGRAM:\nA service animal may be removed from a Penn State facility or program if the animal\u2019s behavior or presence poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. For example, a service animal that displays vicious behavior towards people may be excluded. Excessive barking in a classroom or during a program is an example of disruption.\nService animals may also be excluded in areas where the presence of a service animal fundamentally alters the nature of a program or activity, or is disruptive. Examples may include, but are not limited to: research labs, areas requiring protective clothing, food preparation areas, and animal research labs.\nQuestions related to the use of service animals on campus should be directed to the ADA Coordinator at 814-863-0471.\nREQUESTS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS:\nStudents\nStudent requests for disability accommodations, including requests to have a service animal accompany a student on campus, in classrooms and in Penn State housing facilities, are determined by Student Disability Resources, through the reasonable accommodation request and review process. Students can reach Student Disability Resources at 814-863-1807, or visit the SDR Website.\nEmployees\nEmployee requests for reasonable accommodations, including requests to have a service animal at work, are handled through the ADA Coordinator within the Affirmative Action Office. Employees can view policy HR09, Reasonable Accommodations for University Employees, and may contact the Affirmative Action Office at 814-863-0471 voice and relay for information and assistance.\nVisitors\nService animals accompanying individuals with disabilities are welcome in all areas of campus that are open to the public (except in situations determined to apply as stated in \"When Service Animals May Be Removed or Prohibited,\" above). Specific questions related to the use of service animals on the Penn State campus by visitors can be directed to the ADA Coordinator via e-mail at AAO@psu.edu or by phone at 814-863-0471 voice and relay.\nREQUIREMENTS FOR SERVICE ANIMALS:\nService animals must comply with all applicable Pennsylvania dog laws. Information related to licensing, ID tags, vaccinations, rabies and other requirements under Pennsylvania Dog Law. \u00a0\nLeash: Dogs and must be on a leash at all times, unless impracticable or unfeasible due to owner\/keeper\u2019s disability.\nUnder Control: The owner\/keeper of a service animal must be in full control of the animal at all times. The care and supervision of a service animal is solely the responsibility of owner\/keeper.\nCleanup Rule: The owner\/keeper of a service animal must ensure cleaning up of any Penn State property the animal might soil.\nHealth: Animals to be housed in University Housing must have an annual clean bill of health from a licensed veterinarian.\nService Dogs in Training: Under Pennsylvania law, individuals with disabilities who use guide or support animals, or trainers of such animals, are entitled to equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and education, as well as equal access to and treatment in all public accommodations, and any housing accommodation or commercial property without discrimination. Violation of this law may result in an award of damages or other remedies pursuant to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. 43 P.S. \u00a7 953.\nOTHER RESOURCES:\nU.S. Department of Justice, Information about the Americans with Disabilities Act\nPennsylvania dog law citations:\nCitation: PA ST 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-101 - 1205;

It complements the Campus Master Plan and is approved by the Facilities Resources Committee (FRC). The Outdoor Public Art Master Plan is an \"opportunities plan\" that provides a rational approach to ensuring the best fit between site and Public Art. The Plan delineates three types of outdoor spaces, and specifies the parameters for siting outdoor Public Art in each of those spaces. They include:\nIcon spaces:\nIconic spaces and corridors are the most visible places on campus.\nIconic spaces are recognized symbols of the University.\nOutdoor Public Art in these spaces has universal interest and great significance to the University.\nThe scale of the art corresponds to the scale of the space.\n\nPublic spaces:\nPublic - Primary spaces and corridors are among the most highly visible and most widely recognized spaces on campus.\nPublic - Secondary spaces and corridors are visible to the public and are well visited.\nPublic - Peripheral spaces and corridors are not highly visible to the public.\nOutdoor Public Art in these spaces is as visible and significant as the space it occupies.\nThe scale of the art varies from monumental to human-scale.\n\nPrivate spaces:\nA \"private\" space is typically located in courtyards or niches between buildings.\nPrivate spaces are not highly visible to the public and will generally be visited by those who work or live adjacent to these spaces, or through individual discovery.\nOutdoor Public Art may relate more directly to a unit or represent a more personal statement by a donor than in other campus spaces.\nThe scale of the art may vary from human-scale to intimate-scale.\n\nThe Outdoor Public Art Master Plan is used to guide decision-making regarding siting and selecting outdoor Public Art at University Park. It is the foundation for identifying and evaluating sites for outdoor Public Art, and for recommending a preferred location for each work of outdoor Public Art. An inventory of outdoor Public Art is maintained that includes works of art that are and are not in the Palmer Museum of Art's collection.\nCRITERIA FOR SELECTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC ART:\nThe criteria for selection and acceptance of Public Art shall take into consideration the following factors:\nThe artist is nationally and\/or internationally recognized.\nThe work is conceptually and visually compelling.\nThe work has a pedagogical purpose or value.\nThe work is of museum quality.\nThe work has art historical significance.\nThe work is durable and appropriate for the outdoors (if applicable) and will not require onerous maintenance.\nThe work in some manner represents a critical awareness of and response to contemporary cultural life.\nThe work enhances the physical and aesthetic environment of the campus.\nThe work advances the University's educational mission.\nFunding is in place and is adequate for covering all costs, including installation and maintenance.\nThe artist's willingness to convey ownership of related intellectual property rights to the University.\nPROCEDURES FOR SELECTING, ACQUIRING, COMMISSIONING AND SITING PUBLIC ART:\nAPPROVAL PROCEDURES:\nOutdoor Public Art Master Plan for University Park:\nThe Outdoor Public Art Master Plan Committee develops the Outdoor Public Art Master Plan for the University Park Campus.\nThe Public Art Committee reviews and recommends the Outdoor Public Art Master Plan to the AVPPP for approval.\nThe AVPPP recommends the Master Plan to the FRC for approval.\n\nPermanent Public Art at University Park:\nAll proposals shall be submitted to the Public Art Committee for approval.\nThe Public Art Committee reviews each application for the installation of Public Art for conformance with the Campus Master Plan, the Outdoor Public Art Master Plan and the criteria outlined above.\nThe Public Art Committee recommends proposal to the AVPPP for approval.\nThe AVPPP recommends the proposal to the FRC for approval.\n\nPermanent Public Art at campuses other than University Park:\nAll proposals shall be submitted to the Public Art Committee and to the campus' Chancellor or Dean.\nThe Chancellor or Dean is to request guidance from the University's Public Art Committee prior to advancing the proposal to the AVPPP for approval.\nThe Chancellor or Dean and the AVPPP recommends the proposal to the FRC for approval.\n\nTemporary Installations of Public Art (does not include temporary installations of student projects administered by the School of Visual Arts or other colleges and schools). Also, refer to Policy AD57.\nAt University Park, the proposal may be reviewed by the Public Art Committee, if requested by the AVPPP, and must be approved by the AVPPP.\nAt campuses other than University Park, the proposal may be reviewed by the Public Art Committee if requested, and must be approved by campus Chancellor or Dean.\n\nAPPLICATION:\nThose interested in installing public art on campus shall submit an application to the Public Art Committee that includes the following information:\nName of artist and artist's biographical data.\nName and description of the work of art.\nCost and value of the work of art.\nLocation(s) of artist's other works of art.\nProvisions for property insurance.\nMaintenance Plan with life cycle costs for the work of art.\nMethod of acquisition:\nIf the art is a gift to the University, the name of the donor and any conditions requested by the donor must be provided.\nIf a purchase is to be made, the source of funding and any conditions attached to the use of the funds must be provided.\n\nDescription of artist's intent for work of art, or a proposed site for the work of art.\nMAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ART:\nOffice of Physical Plant (\"OPP\") will approve the methods for installing, resiting, and maintaining public works of art.\nOPP will maintain outdoor Public Art at the University Park campus. Public Art at campuses other than University Park will be maintained by that campus' physical plant. An analysis of anticipated maintenance requirements will be a consideration in the selection and acceptance of Public Art.

INDIRECT (F&A) COSTS\nThere are a number of costs which are typically covered by F&A, including administrative and clerical salaries, general purpose equipment, paper, toner, office supplies, routine photocopying, mailing services, telecommunication costs, and memberships. In special circumstances, it may be permissible to charge such items as direct costs, but only after completing a\u00a0Cost Accounting Justification\u00a0Form. \u00a0If this form was not completed at the time of the proposal, it MUST be completed when the cost is incurred. \u00a0Please note that if the expenses were not included in the original proposal, it may be necessary to request the sponsor's prior approval before direct charging such costs. Additional guidance can be found in RA21 and the Cost Accounting Standards FAQ. \u00a0\u00a0\nNOTE: Although applied through a rate, fringe benefits are a direct cost. \u00a0Therefore directly charged salaries will always have directly applied fringe benefits.\nDOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS\nAll costs need to have adequate documentation to support their application to a sponsored award. \u00a0The documentation must provide enough detail for a reasonable person to understand the purpose of the cost and how it benefited the sponsored award. \u00a0These justifications must be documented in appropriate IBIS forms through the explanation, purpose, description and\/or notepad. Additional justification, such as the Cost Accounting Justification Form noted above, or explanations for late transfers, may also be required by the Research Coordinator or Financial Officer, beyond the detail included within the expense transaction.\nFalse Claims\nSignatures on reports, including effort confirmation, are asserting a claim that the contents of the reports are accurate and appropriate. \u00a0To protect those signing, thorough review of reports, including effort confirmations, is critical before reports are signed. \u00a0It is the responsibility of the PI to bring to the Research Administrator or Financial Officer any questions regarding reported costs before signing and certifying the costs. \u00a0\u00a0Knowingly signing an incorrect report regarding costs charged to a sponsored award is a false claim. See RA02 \u2013 Stewardship of Sponsored Programs for additional information regarding compliance with the False Claims Act.\nPRE-AWARD EXPENDITURES:\nADVANCED FUND NUMBERS\nOccasionally, a college\/unit will decide to establish a restricted account before the agreement has been fully executed. For example, certain federal agencies permit universities to incur costs up to 90 days prior to the begin date of a grant. In other cases, colleges and units will decide to accept the risk associated with establishing a restricted account, even though the formal agreement has not yet been received, negotiated, and\/or executed in the Office of Sponsored Programs. In all such cases, advanced restricted accounts (or \"advanced funds\" as they are more commonly referred to) must be established.\n\tNo work should be done and no expenses should be incurred on a project until an account has been established in the University accounting system (IBIS). \u00a0\u00a0It is unacceptable to charge such costs to general funds or to other restricted accounts.\nThe unit that established the advanced fund assumes all financial and non-financial responsibility in the event the agreement is never executed. Invoicing cannot occur until an agreement is fully executed.\nEven if the college\/unit is willing to accept the financial risk associated with incurring costs for a pending project, it is still essential to ensure that the performance of the project will not jeopardize human subjects or animal subjects, expose personnel to health and safety risks, or violate laws and regulations (e.g., performing work for a sanctioned person or country). Thus, advance funds will not be established until all required compliance checks are complete.\u00a0\u00a0See\u00a0RP03 \u2013 The Use of Human Participants in Research, RP04 \u2013 Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals, RP06 \u2013 Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests, RA40 \u2013 Compliance with Federal Export Regulations,\u00a0and RAG40 \u2013 Guidelines for Ensuring Compliance with Export Control Policy RA18.\nBUDGET REALIGNMENT:\nBudget realignment is the process of adjusting the original awarded budget. \u00a0There are many considerations in determining if a budget can be realigned, including departmental and college restrictions. \u00a0Agency or sponsor regulations are the prime determinant if realignment is permitted and within what parameters. \u00a0PIs must refer to the award terms and conditions before making changes to the original awarded budget.\nSee RA63 \u2013 Budget Realignment for detailed information regarding Federal Awards and budget realignment.\n\u00a0\n\t\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may apply, especially:\nRA02 \u2013 Stewardship of Sponsored Program\nRA21 \u2013 Development of Proposal Budget\nRA40 \u2013 Compliance with Federal Export Regulations\nRA63 \u2013 Budget Realignment\nRAG40 \u2013 Guidelines for Ensuring Compliance with Export Control Policy RA18\nRP03 \u2013 The Use of Human Participants in Research (Formerly Policy RA14)\nRP04 \u2013 Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals (Formerly Policy RA15)\nRP06 \u2013 Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\n\u00a0\n\t\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nOctober 20, 2017 - Added \"Unemployment Compensation\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide policy on costs incurred on sponsored awards to assure compliance with controlling guidance."},{"university":"psu","name":"hrg06","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermining Vacation and Sick Leave for Staff Employees whose Work Schedules Conform with Academic Semesters and \/or Summer Sessions | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesDetermining Vacation and Sick Leave for Staff Employees whose Work Schedules Conform with Academic Semesters and \/or Summer Sessions \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Guidelines\n\nHRG06\nDetermining Vacation and Sick Leave for Staff Employees whose Work Schedules Conform with Academic Semesters and \/or Summer Sessions\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\n\u00a0\nGUIDELINE'S INITIAL DATE: October, 1975\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: October 1, 1992\nContent:\nPurpose\nFor Those Employed Full-Time, Including Working During Semester Breaks\nFor Those Employed Full-Time, But Not During Semester Breaks\n\n\nFOR THOSE EMPLOYED FULL-TIME, INCLUDING WORKING DURING SEMESTER BREAKS:\nEmployees who normally work through periods when classes are not held earn vacation and sick leave in accordance with HR34.\nFOR THOSE EMPLOYED FULL-TIME, BUT NOT DURING SEMESTER BREAKS:\nEmployees who normally are not required to work during breaks between semesters and summer sessions do not earn vacation accumulation, since the student recesses replace the vacation accumulation.

The request must be made during the first three years of tenure-eligible service at Penn State, or prior to the completion of the fourth year tenure review, inclusive of prior credit of tenure-eligible service, whichever occurs first. In the College of Medicine, the request must be made during the first five years or prior to the sixth-year tenure review.\nDEAN'S APPROVAL:\nThe appropriate academic dean has the authority to approve a request for a reduction of prior tenure credit as outlined in this guideline. The dean may not rescind more years of service than those requested by the faculty member.However, the dean may rescind less than those originally requested with the concurrence of the faculty member.\nPROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED:\nThe faculty member petitions the dean, in writing, via the appropriate department head, for a reduction of prior tenure credit.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe department head discusses the request with the dean of the college.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIf the dean concurs with the request, the dean prepares and sends to the Office of Human Resources instructions for the reduction of prior tenure credit, with a copy to the Executive Vice President and Provost.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe Office of Human Resources prepares the revised Memorandum of Personal Service in accordance with the instructions from the dean, and specifies on the revised memorandum that it supersedes the previously completed and signed memorandum.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe Office of Human Resources sends the revised Memorandum of Personal Service to the appropriate dean for concurrence.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe dean distributes the revised Memorandum of Personal Service to the faculty member with a request that the original be signed and returned to the Office of Human Resources via the office of the dean.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe Office of Human Resources, upon the receipt of the signed, revised Memorandum of Personal Service, takes steps to revise the faculty member's prior tenure credit as recorded in the master tenure file.\n3\/10\/17 - \"Limit for Submitting Requests\" section revised to include the College of Medicine. \"Procedure to Be Followed\" section, part 3 updated to reflect Executive Vice President and Provost title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To permit a reduction in prior tenure credit upon the written request of a faculty member and subject to the concurrence of the appropriate dean.(NOTE: \"Prior tenure credit\" is defined as credit awarded to the faculty member at the time of appointment to a tenure track position.)"},{"university":"psu","name":"sy36","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorridor Storage and Use | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesCorridor Storage and Use \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY36\nCorridor Storage and Use\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nReferences\nDefinitions\nApplicability\nPolicy \nResponsibilities\nAdditional Resources\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nREFERENCES:\nThe International Fire Code as Adopted by PA Labor and Industry \u2013 Latest Edition\nLocal amendments to The International Fire Code\n29 CFR 1910 OSHA General Industry Regulations Subpart E \u2013 Means of Egress\nNational Fire Protection Association Standard 101 \u201cLife Safety Code\u201d 2000 edition\nInternational Code Council \/ ANSI A117.1 \u2013 2003 Edition\nDEFINITIONS:\nBuilding Corridor \/ Hallway: Any passageway connecting individual rooms and spaces that lead to an exit door, stairwell, or other place of refuge used by personnel evacuating the area and emergency personnel arriving to the area.\nArea of Refuge: A space protected from the effects of fire by means of separation from other spaces in the same building (e.g., stairway landings, vestibule), permitting a delay in egress travel from any level.\nEquipment: Anything which occupies a permanent footprint on the floor and requires electrical power to operate (e.g., copy machine, vending machine).\nMaterial: Item such as file cabinet, furnishing, trash\/recycling container, construction material.\nService Aisle way: An aisle way designed and dedicated for the placement of equipment and supplies to support building operations. Service aisle ways are physically separated from public corridors and not designed for public use.\nStairway: One or more flights of stairs, either exterior or interior, that serves as the primary vertical means of egress for personnel evacuating the area and emergency responders arriving to the area.\nTemporary: Thirty days maximum duration.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy applies to corridors and stairways in all Pennsylvania State University owned, occupied or operated facilities with the exception of the Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine.\nPOLICY:\nStorage in and use of corridors or stairways in Penn State University owned, occupied or operated facilities must be in accordance with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910 General Industry Regulations Subpart E \u201cMeans of Egress,\u201d The International Fire Code, local municipality ordinances and procedures established herein. This policy prohibits the placement or storage of materials and equipment in corridors and stairways that may negatively impact emergency evacuation, contribute or result in building emergency events, or reduce or delay emergency responders entering the area.\nMaintaining clear corridors and paths of egress travel is fundamental to life safety. Egress corridors are intended by the code to be separate and distinct from occupied work areas to protect the occupants\u2019 path to the exterior and to keep known hazards typically found in work spaces and their consequent dangers from endangering larger numbers of occupants evacuating the area. The generally accepted minimum unobstructed corridor width of 44 inches shall apply to most university buildings; however, in buildings containing large lecture halls, classrooms, recreational and assembly areas or large buildings with increased occupant loads, an evaluation by Environmental Health and Safety will need to be conducted to determine the minimum required clear exit width.\nA minimum 36 inch clear width shall be maintained in service aisle ways.\nMany buildings contain corridors which are wider than the minimum required clear exit width. In certain situations it may be possible to utilize space in corridors for other purposes in addition to occupant movement.\nFunding the removal of unacceptable items from corridors or other locations as specified by this policy will be the responsibility of the work unit storing the materials. If the Office of Physical Plant funds the removal of such items, they will be reimbursed by the work unit responsible for the storage. Unacceptable items are subject to removal by the Office of Physical Plant (or EHS if hazardous materials are involved) within 30 days after the violations are observed. Safety Officers will be notified of violations in advance of the items being removed.\nThe following are conditions that allow for equipment and materials storage in corridors: \nBuilding Facility Coordinator approval must be granted prior to the placement of any item(s) in building corridors, as specified in accordance with this policy.\nEquipment and materials shall not be placed within 8 feet of exit doors and stairwell doors.\nA minimum wall clearance of 18 inches shall be provided on both sides of fire extinguishers, fire alarm pull stations, fire hose connections, fire blanket cabinets, safety showers, AED (Automated External Defibrillator) stations, utility panels and access panels.\nCorridor placement of books\/paper, plastic, cardboard, glassware etc. shall be in enclosed storage cabinets including file drawers. This shall not prevent the posting of class information in corridors in accordance with OPP procedures and the placement of a small container for the drop-off of homework assignments.\nFurniture which does not contain highly combustible materials such as polyurethane foam, padding and stuffing, is permitted in corridors.\nAcceptable materials and equipment placed in corridors shall be located along one side of the corridor.\nOffice of Physical Plant provided trash and recycling containers shall be permitted to be placed in corridors.\nAll equipment and temporarily placed materials in corridors shall be clearly labeled with the owners name, contact information, and date placed in corridor.\nMaterials may not be placed closer than 18 inches to the bottom of sprinkler heads.\nEquipment (e.g., vending machines) placed in corridors requiring electrical power shall have a dedicated electrical receptacle nearby. Electrical extension cords are not permitted to be used.\nIf a building will remain in use during renovation and construction activities, the temporary staging of materials related to construction \/ renovation activities is permitted in corridors as long as the minimum required exit width is provided for building occupants and workers. Under no conditions may items be placed or staged in stairways. All materials placed in the corridor during the construction project must be removed from the corridor as soon as possible. No materials may remain in the corridor after thirty days following project completion even if the 44 inch minimum width can be provided.\nThe following equipment and items are prohibited from corridor storage at all times: \nFlammable and combustible liquids\nHazardous chemicals\nCompressed gas cylinders\nEquipment operating under either positive or negative pressure, high temperature or high voltage\nEquipment with exposed machine parts (e.g., unguarded belts, pulleys or gears)\nAny items which move easily or could fall over and cause an obstruction\nFurniture or other items that contain highly combustible materials such as polyurethane foam\nAny item or combination of items in a quantity or configuration that presents a fire or life safety hazard to the public, physically impaired persons or emergency response personnel\nAny item that has both (1) a protrusion into the corridors walking surface of 4 inches or more and (2) the protrusion is at a height of 27 to 80 inches above the floor\nCorridor space shall not be utilized to create additional workstations\nFood preparation appliances including microwave ovens, coffee makers and toasters unless the location (e.g. designated alcove, break area) is permitted by code standards (by the Office of Physical Plant Design and Construction Division)\nStairwell Usage Restrictions\nIn the event of an emergency, stairwells serve as the primary vertical exit path for occupants evacuating the area. It is critical that stairwells remain clear and unobstructed at all times. No equipment, furniture, or materials is permitted in stairways regardless of combustibility or location within the stairwell, unless a code approved (by the Office of Physical Plant Design and Construction Division) enclosure is provided.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nThe success of this policy depends upon the cooperation of all University employees and students. It is the responsibility of all members of the Penn State community to observe this policy. Each University member is responsible to comply with this policy at his \/ her level of involvement in the University community.\nAdministrative Unit Heads:\nAssure that facilities under their jurisdiction are in compliance with this Policy.\nFacility Coordinators:\nBe aware of the policy and communicate policy content to appropriate individuals within their jurisdiction.\nApprove the placement of any items in building corridors.\nWork with Project Managers and Project Coordinators to identify alternate locations for placement of materials and displaced room furnishings during construction activity to ensure compliance with this policy and to resolve problems.\nMonitor compliance and assist with issues related to the policy.\nUniversity Safety Council Representatives (a.k.a.

When the faculty member speaks or writes as a citizen, the faculty member shall be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but the special position in the community held by the faculty member imposes special obligations. As a person of learning and an educator, the faculty member is expected to remember that the public may judge the profession and institution by his\/her utterances. Hence, the faculty member agrees at all times to be accurate, to exercise appropriate restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to indicate that he\/she is not an institutional spokesperson.\nAS RELATED TO THE UNIVERSITY:\nThe efficient operation of any institution requires cooperation among its personnel. The faculty member agrees, therefore, to abide by the regulations of the University, and to perform to the best of his\/her ability such reasonable duties as are assigned by authorized University officials. Faculty members are free to speak and write on governance issues of their respective departments, colleges, units, libraries, and of theUniversity as a whole, and are free to speak and write on all matters related to their professional duties without institutional discipline or restraint. Similarly, faculty members recognize that they are expected to exercise professional responsibility in their service roles. Faculty members are responsible for respecting confidentiality and the privacy rights of others.\nIN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION:\nFaculty members are free to engage in research or scholarship of their own undertaking, and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of other academic duties. Research conducted for this University shall be in harmony with the provisions set forth in the official research policies of the institution, or in memoranda of agreement entered into between the University and industries or other agencies. Librarians are free to select and make available any materials supporting the teaching, research, and general learning functions of the academic community.\nIN INSTRUCTIONAL ROLES:\nAcademic freedom is also inherent in faculty members' roles in the classroom and in related instructional activities.Faculty members are, however, responsible for the maintenance of appropriate standards of scholarship and teaching ability, and for ensuring that there is no insertion or intrusion of material that has no relation to the subject matter of instruction. Faculty members are expected to educate students to think for themselves, and to facilitate access to relevant materials that they need to form their own opinions. Faculty members are expected to present information fairly, and to set forth justly divergent opinions that arise out of scholarly methods and professionalism.\nNo faculty member may claim as a right the privilege of discussing in the classroom controversial topics outside or unrelated to his\/her own field of study. The faculty member is normally bound not to take advantage of his\/her position by introducing into the classroom provocative discussions of irrelevant subjects not within the field of his\/her study.\nAPPEALS:\nIf a faculty member feels that his or her academic freedom rights have been violated, the procedure listed in the policy entitled, \"Faculty Rights andResponsibilities\" AC76 may be used.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD47 - General Standards of Professional Ethics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the conditions of academic freedom for faculty members. Academic freedom refers to the environment provided by the University that permits faculty members to engage in their scholarly pursuits of teaching, research, and related activities at institutions of higher education. Academic freedom thus embodies the conditions necessary for the University to fulfill its mission of creating new knowledge and of effectively communicating accumulated knowledge and understanding to students and to the community at large. Academic responsibility refers to the duty and obligation of all faculty to pursue their academic pursuits with forthrightness, recognizing that while all members of the University have the right to express their own views and to hear the views of others expressed, as well as the responsibility for according the same rights to others, they also have a duty to make it clear when they are not speaking for the institution in matters of public interest. The University should be an institution whose members may express themselves, while protecting and respecting the rights of others to learn, to do research, and to carry out the essential functions of the University free from interference or obstruction."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr06","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Appointments | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesTypes of Appointments \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR06\nTypes of Appointments\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nCONTENTS:\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nNon-exempt\nExempt\nFull-time Equivalency (FTE)\nStandard Work Week\nFiscal Year\n\nAppointment Types\nUnpaid Appointments\nAcademic Affiliate Appointments\nContingent Appointments\n\nPaid Appointments\nEmployee Appointments\nFull-time Employee Types\nFull-time Position Types\nStanding\nFixed-term I\nFixed-term Multi-year\n\n\nPart-time Employee Types\nPart-time Academic\nPart-time Non-academic\n\n\nStudent Appointments\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\nNon-exempt \nNon-exempt employees are subject to state and federal overtime provisions and must be paid at a rate of one and one-half times their normal hourly rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week.

This agency shall also be responsible for the coordination of all hazardous waste disposal efforts.\nThe Directors of Business Services, in conjunction with the individual hazardous waste generators at non-University Park locations, and the individual hazardous waste generators at University Park, shall be responsible for coordinating the collection of hazardous waste with Environmental Health and Safety.\nThe custody and disposition of all chemicals\/materials obtained or produced by, for and\/or resulting from experiments, research or purchase is the responsibility of the University employee and\/of their organizational unit so pre-occupied. The organization's budget under which such chemicals\/materials are obtained or produced may also be required to fund the analysis of such items which cannot be identified by their proper or generic name or are improperly labeled. All containers of chemicals\/materials must be clearly identified and labeled as to their contents. UNKNOWNS OR IMPROPERLY LABELED CHEMICALS\/MATERIALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR DISPOSAL.\nNormal hazardous waste disposal costs will be funded through Environmental Health and Safety.\nGenerators of hazardous waste are responsible to ensure the appropriate storage, labeling, inspection, auditing, documentation, and segregation of chemicals, and to provide and document training of all personnel involved in the handling of this waste.\nThe indiscriminate drain-disposal of chemicals\/materials is not permitted. Drain disposal of chemical waste materials shall be permitted only with specific written approval by Environmental Health and Safety.\nDepartments that generate hazardous chemical wastes shall ensure that a waste reduction program is in effect and that it is being adhered to.\nREDUCING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS:\nTo effect a reduction in the volume of hazardous waste generated at the University, as mandated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), generators of hazardous waste shall minimize the volume or toxicity of their waste.\nSubstitutions can be made to eliminate or reduce the amount of hazardous ingredients.\nManagement practices can greatly reduce unnecessary waste generation. This includes the purchase of only the quantity of material anticipated to be used and establishing usage parameters for each chemical.\nHazardous materials may be redistributed or returned. Often, surplus chemicals can be redistributed within the University or returned to the manufacturer. Lists of redistributable chemicals should be circulated among faculty and staff within work units or departments. Such a list should contain the following information:\nchemical name,\namount,\nmanufacturer,\nPurity, as stated on label, and\nwhether the container is unopened.\nEHS maintains a listing of chemicals that are available for redistribution.\nBulking of compatible chemicals. Environmental Health and Safety shall provide guidance in the consolidation of compatible chemicals. A significant reduction in disposal costs can be achieved in the bulking of these chemicals.\nWaste segregation. Mixing wastes can be hazardous; incompatible wastes can react - and explode. Wastes transported to the Chemical Waste Storage facility must be segregated to avoid these reactions. A further reduction in the costs for waste disposal can be achieved by reducing packaging time as compatible chemicals can be packed more efficiently. Chemicals should be segregated into the following categories: flammables, corrosives, poisons, and oxidizers.\nIntegrate micro-scale techniques into organic and inorganic chemistry laboratory courses and research projects. These techniques can reduce chemical purchase costs and significantly reduce the quantities of waste chemicals for disposal. Use of micro-scale also reduces student and faculty exposure to toxic chemicals, carcinogens, flammables and explosives.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nIndividuals responsible for laboratories and other areas which handle and store hazardous waste are required to:\nEach room generating chemical waste must designate a location with in the room for waste accumulation. This area is referred to as the \"Accumulation Area.\"\nDesignate an individual who is responsible to oversee the proper storage, labeling and inspection of this Accumulation Area and who conducts weekly inspections of this area, documenting and maintaining the results of the inspection.\nEnsure all laboratory personnel involved in chemical waste management are trained and documentation of training records is maintained.\nEstablish, implement and document an annual review of all hazardous materials to ensure those exceeding safe and practical usage are properly disposed of.\nIncorporate waste disposal management practices into all procedures, including laboratory manuals used for instruction.\nConduct audits of waste management procedures as established in this policy to ensure compliance and implement the necessary changes.\nDepartment heads\/heads of administrative units are responsible to:\nMaintain a listing of accumulation areas and individuals responsible for oversight.\nMaintain copies of training documents.\nConduct audits of waste management procedures within facilities under their jurisdiction as established in this policy to ensure compliance and implement the necessary changes.\nDeans of Academic Colleges\/Heads of Administrative Units are responsible to:\nDesignate a College\/Unit-wide individual to oversee program.\nConduct audits of waste management procedures established in this policy to ensure compliance and implement the necessary changes.\nPROCEDURES:\nCollection and transportation of hazardous waste at University Park:\nA laboratory or facility that has hazardous waste for disposal shall complete a Chemical Waste Pickup Request Form available at www.ehs.psu.edu, or contact EHS at 814-865-6391.\nEnvironmental Health and Safety personnel will collect and transport the hazardous waste to the Chemical Accumulation Facility. Procedures for the collection of specially-arranged disposal activities will be established by EHS.\nThe spill or discharge of any hazardous material must be reported to Environmental Health and Safety at 865-6391 during regular working hours (Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.). At other times and on weekends, the incident must be reported to University Police and Public Safety at 814-863-1111. Environmental Health and Safety personnel will report to the site of the incident and provide guidance and direction in proper cleanup procedures, as deemed appropriate.They will provide or recommend appropriate equipment for the cleanup, and arrange for the proper disposal of the hazardous waste.\nDisposal of hazardous waste at non-University Park locations (except Hershey Medical Center):\nOther locations that have hazardous waste for disposal will forward a properly completed Chemical Waste Pickup Request Form to Environmental Health and Safety.\nEnvironmental Health and Safety will arrange to have the hazardous waste picked up by a commercial vendor.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nEffective Date: November 9, 2000\n\tDate Approved: November 7, 2000\u00a0\n\tDate Published: November 9, 2000 (Editorial changes, June 16, 2014)\nMost recent changes:\nJune 16, 2014- Corrections to Revision History, August 4, 1976 through February 26, 1992, per additional information discovered and added to the working papers.\nJune 12, 2014 - Policy updated to reflect minor operational and editorial changes in POLICY, RESPONSIBILITIES and PROCEDURES sections.

It may include the Federal and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity.\"\nTo understand the government's basic philosophy on budget building and review, however, one must turn to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). Much of what the FAR states about cost estimating applies equally to grants as well as contracts. The FAR points out the following about cost estimates, their content and their purpose:\n\"When contracting on a cost-reimbursement basis, evaluations shall include a cost realism analysis to determine what the Government should realistically expect to pay for the proposed effort, the offeror's understanding of the work, and the offeror's ability to perform the contract.\" [FAR15.305(a)(1)]\n\"The objective of proposal analysis is to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable.\" [FAR 15-404-1(a)]\nProposal analysis by the Federal agency may also include \"review to determine whether any cost data or pricing data, necessary to make the offer's proposal suitable for negotiation, have not been either submitted or identified in writing by the offeror. If there are such data, the contracting officer shall attempt to obtain and use them in the negotiations or make satisfactory allowance for the incomplete data. [FAR 15.404-1(c)(2)(iv)]\nNOTE: If the budget is reduced by the agency, the PI should make corresponding reductions in the scope of work.\nAGENCY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR PROPOSAL BUDGET PREPARATION:\nFederal: The development of a proposal budget is generally governed by the application guidelines that are disseminated by the particular sponsoring agency. These are contained in the appropriate section of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for the various Federal funding agencies.\nNon-Federal: The application guidelines provided by the awarding organization govern the development of the proposal budget.\nMore detail\nPROGRAM INCOME:\nProgram income is gross income earned as part of a sponsored award, such as registration fees paid for a conference conducted as part of a sponsored award. If a sponsored award will generate program income, this must be accounted for as part of the award. See RA66, Program Income.\nGENERAL COST CATEGORIES:\nThe following represent general categories of budget items frequently proposed for externally funded sponsored awards. The specific order or placement within a budget is dependent upon the format requested by the sponsor.\nThere are certain types of costs which are assumed not to be direct costs and should not be included in a proposal. These are noted below under each category as appropriate.\n\u00a0\n1. Direct Labor (salaries and wages)\nThe budget justification should identify specific individuals to be working on the project (or if individuals are not known at the proposal stage, the justification should identify positions by title and give the number of individuals for each title), amount of time (normally a percent of effort or months of effort) to be devoted to the sponsored project and salary associated with that time. The basis for developing estimates begins with the salary of the individual (or an average rate for the position, if the individual is not known) for the current Penn State fiscal year. This amount should be multiplied by the percent of effort on the project being proposed for the individual to compute salaries to be applied to the current fiscal year. (See Projecting Cost Inflation Factors section below regarding cost projections for future periods.)\nMinimum Faculty Effort: According to OMB memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001 (as referenced in Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.306(k)), most federally funded research programs should have some level of committed effort by faculty (or senior researchers) either paid (by the federal government) or unpaid (cost shared by the institution), unless there is a legitimate reason that there would be no effort on the agreement. In the following cases, it is considered legitimate for Penn State to show zero faculty effort:\nGifts\nInstrumentation grants (where the sole purpose of the grant is to procure equipment or property)\n\nConference\/workshop grants (where the sole purpose of the grant is to support a conference or workshop.\n\nTraining grants and other student-led projects where the PI is just supervising student effort\nIndustry membership agreements (as long as some source of funds is identified for covering the PI's administrative effort)\nNon-federal projects < $50K as long as a percent of the PI's time is paid on general funds. (If a researcher is paid solely on external funds, then some percentage of his or her salary must be charged to every project on which he or she works.)\nPenn State requires minimum faculty effort on both federal and non-federal projects. The rule applies not only to Principal Investigators but to all Senior Personnel on the project. (For the purpose of this policy, Penn State uses NSF's definition of Senior Personnel as defined here. For more information, see Penn State's Compensation FAQ.)\nAdministrative Salaries: Salaries of administrative and technical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs on federal funds may be appropriate only if all of the following conditions are met:\nAdministrative or clerical services are integral to a project or activity;\nIndividuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity;\nSuch costs are explicitly included in the budget or have the prior written approval of the Federal awarding agency; and\nThe costs are not also recovered as indirect costs (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.413(c)).\nDirect charging of administrative salaries must be documented through the Cost Accounting Justification Form. In order to ensure that administrative salaries are allocable to the project (as defined in RA10 \u2013 Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards), such costs will not be approved as direct charges unless they constitute a level of support greater than the routine level of service normally provided by an administering department. Thus, Penn State will only permit such costs to be direct charged to a project when 10% or more of an individual's effort will be allocated to the sponsored award.\nTechnical Staff Salaries (including IT support personnel): Technical staff salaries are considered a subset of administrative salaries, subject to all the rules stipulated above. IT services normally provided as ongoing support for a unit, such as regular hardware and software maintenance, should be treated as F&A costs. Technical costs may be charged directly to sponsored projects when they are described in the project's scope of work and can be easily identified to a particular sponsored agreement. IT support which requires technical understanding of aspects of the specific project (e.g., knowledge of research data, design or calibration of test equipment, maintenance or repair in a remote off-site location) may be charged directly, but should be documented using the Cost Accounting Justification Form. Penn State will only permit such costs to be direct charged to a project when 10% of more of an individual's effort will be allocated to the sponsored award.\nRetired Faculty: If retired faculty are participating on a sponsored award, Guideline RAG03, Retired Faculty Participation must be followed as well as Policy HR45 \u2013 Post-Retirement Appointments.\nSalary Caps: Certain federal agencies have established reimbursement salary caps. If an individual whose salary exceeds the cap is performing effort on an account subject to a reimbursement salary cap, the amount charged to the account for each month must be calculated to account for the cap. See RA64 \u2013 Personnel Costs, and RAG64 \u2013 Salary Caps, for more detail.\n\u00a0\n2. Negotiated Rates - Fringe Benefits\nThe budget justification should include the current applicable fringe benefit rates and statements that these rates are reviewed and approved by the University's cognizant federal agency, the Office of Naval Research (ONR).\nApplication of Fringe Benefits - The actual negotiated fringe benefit rates will be charged regardless of whether such rates are higher or lower than the rates used in the applicable proposal. The fringe benefit rates will be adjusted each July 1 for projects overlapping fiscal years.\nRates to provide for recovery of fringe benefits as well as F&A are negotiated periodically with the ONR, based upon proposals submitted by the University and audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). Current fringe benefit, F&A, and tuition remission rates are available on the Office of Sponsored Programs website.\n\u00a0\n3. Other Direct Costs:\na. Subcontracts - Identify individual subcontractors (if known) and the total estimated cost for each. When the subcontractor is known, the following items should accompany the budget justification:\nan itemized budget with appropriate detail presented on the sponsor's required forms,\na statement of work to be performed by the subcontractor, and\na commitment to perform as a subcontractor, as evidenced by a signature of an authorized official of the subcontractor. [Refer to Penn State's Policy RA80, Subawards and Subcontracts.]\nb. Consultants - Identify consultants to be used, time to be spent on the project, and rates of pay. (Some federal agencies restrict the rate of pay, usually at a rate not to exceed the equivalent of the daily rate for GS-18 in Federal service, excluding expenses and University indirect costs.) The need for the consultant and the work to be performed must be identified in the proposal. See Penn State's Policy BS17, Use and Procurement of External Consultants.\nc. Equipment - List separately items of equipment equal to or exceeding $5,000 and having a useful life of one (1) or more years. The basis for the cost estimates must be available to provide evidence to support the costs proposed. The need for the equipment and the purpose of the equipment must be identified in the proposal and\/or within the budget justification.\nNote: General purpose equipment usually is not allowable as a direct cost to Federal sponsored projects. If included in a proposal, a Cost Accounting Justification Form should be completed to document the justification for general purpose equipment to be included as a direct cost.\nd. Supplies - Provide general categories of budgeted supplies and estimated cost. The basis for the cost estimates must be available to provide evidence to support the costs proposed. The need for the supplies must be addressed in the proposal.\nNote: Office supplies usually are not allowable as a direct cost to Federal sponsored projects. If included in a proposal, a Cost Accounting Justification Form should be completed to document the justification for office supplies to be included as a direct cost.\ne. Travel - List proposed trips individually, describe their purpose in relation to the grant and provide details that are known, such as dates, destinations, and number of travelers. Explain how the costs for each were derived (e.g., provide a breakdown of airfare, car rental, per diem, etc.). Be aware of any foreign travel restrictions which may impact the ability to travel. All foreign travel must also comply with Federal Export Control Regulations \u2013 see RA40, Compliance With Federal Export Regulations, and RAG40, Guidelines for Ensuring Compliance With Export Control Policy RA40.\nf. Specialized Services or Institutional Service Operations - Use of specialized services (e.g., Animal Resource Program) or institutional service operations (e.g. Fleet Services, Chemistry stockroom) must be budgeted at the currently approved rates. Rates are reviewed and approved by the Controller's Office, and can be obtained from Cost Analysis. See Policy AD15, Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services.\ng. Tuition Remission - Tuition remission rates for graduate assistants are set by the University each fiscal year and are available here.\nh. Participant Support Costs - These are direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees in connection with conferences or training projects. See Policy RA22, Participant Support Costs.\ni. Other - Enter the total of any other direct costs not covered by 2.a. through 2.f. Include in the budget justification a list explaining the relationship of each to the proposed project and the basis for the estimate.\nNote: Certain other costs such as postage, local telephone costs, express mailing and memberships usually are not allowable as a direct cost to Federal sponsored projects, except where approved in advance by the sponsoring agency. If included in a proposal, a Cost Accounting Justification Form should be completed to document the justification for other costs to be included as a direct cost. See Penn State's Cost Accounting Standards FAQ for further details regarding these and other budget items.\n\u00a0\n4. Facilities and Administration (F&A) Costs:\nThe appropriate F&A rate must be applied with the proposed budget to recover costs which are indirectly associated with the sponsored award. Indirect costs are real costs which are applied through a percentage rate established based on federal costing policies. Rates are available here.\nSee RA30, Facilities and Administrative (F&A) Costs for more detail on these costs, including policy regarding on and off-campus rates.\nApplication of F&A Costs - The negotiated rates in effect at the time of the initial award will establish the rates for the life of the award or each competitive segment thereof. Awards which involve units subject to different F&A rates (e.g., College of Health and Human Development and College of Medicine) require separate accounts linked by fund number. The Principal Investigator (and appropriate administrative personnel) should be given access to all accounts associated with the award, so they can maintain proper oversight of the award as a whole.\nBase Determination - F&A will be applied to Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC). Modified Total Direct Costs are all costs excluding equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000. (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.68).\nPROJECTING COST-INFLATION FACTORS:\nEstimates of personnel and other direct costs for out years should be proposed using reasonable percentage increases as defined annually by the University Corporate Controller. Variation from the approved rates is allowable when:\na. the agency requires the use of a lower factor;\nb. documented historical data supports the use of a higher rate; or\nc. other significant changes that affect cost can be anticipated with accuracy, e.g., faculty promotions in rank.\nUp-to-date information regarding current inflation factors.\nSUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:\nSupporting documentation must be available to provide evidence that the cost estimates are reasonable, accurate, and current as of the time of the proposal or negotiations. This documentation may include catalog prices, telephone or written quotes or institutional records such as Purchase Orders.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther sources in GURU may also apply, especially:\nAD15 - Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services\nAD89 - University Export Compliance Policy\nADG09 - Export Compliance Definitions, Procedures and Implementation Guidelines\nRA10 - Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards\nRA22 - Participant Support Costs\nRA30 - Facilities and Administrative (F&A) Costs (Formerly RAG06)\nRA40 - Compliance with Federal Export Regulations (Formerly RA18)\nRA50 - Cost Sharing\nRA64 - Personnel Costs\nRA65 - Non-Personnel Costs\nRA66 \u2013 Program Income\nRA80 \u2013 Subawards and Subcontracts\nRAG03 - Retired Faculty Participation\nRAG40 - Guidelines for Ensuring Compliance With Export Control Policy RA40\nRAG64 \u2013 Salary Caps (Formerly RA08)\nEffective Date: July 5, 2017\n\tDate Approved: July 5, 2017\n\tDate Published: July 5, 2017\nMost Recent Changes\nJuly 5, 2017 - Information pertaining to Conference\/workshop grants was added to the bulleted list under the \"Minimum Faculty Effort\" section.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating parts of old RA03) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nMarch 19, 2013 - Editorial changes made, correcting links to OMB Circulars A-21 and A-110 that are cross referenced throughout the document.\nFebruary 23, 2010 - Editorial changes made, correcting the names and links of related policy guidelines and FAR regulations that are cross referenced.\nAugust 14, 2006 - Reference to RAG03 added; minor editorial changes made.\nMarch 7, 2005 - Editorial changes to correct links.\nMay 24, 2002:\nUnder Guideline 1 - Direct Labor - added that a clarification of A-21 issued by the OMB states that most federally funded research programs should have some level of committed effort by faculty (or senior researchers).\nChanged the footnote under Guideline 1 regarding salaries of administrative and clerical staff normally being treated as F&A costs, from \"except where approved in advance by the sponsoring agency\" to \"where it meets the standards of Exhibit C to A-21, and such costs are treated in accordance with RAG01\".\n\nDecember 5, 2000 - Title of cross- referenced policy RAG02 changed from \"Requesting Equipment Matching Funds\" to \"Equipment Matching Funds Program\".\nFebruary 20, 1998 - Reformatted for GURU from OSP Policy dated September 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To define general University policies that govern the development proposal budgets for sponsored projects."},{"university":"psu","name":"bs08","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Inquiries  | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesInformation Inquiries  \n\n\n\nBusiness Services Policies\n\nBS08\nInformation Inquiries \nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssociate Vice President for Auxiliary & Business Services>\nContents:\nPurpose\nVendor Relations and Vendor Contacts\nDemonstration or Sample Equipment\nFurther Information\n\n\nVENDOR RELATIONS AND VENDOR CONTACTS:\nIt is imperative that good relationships be established between the University and its vendors.

Actions which serve personal interests to the detriment of University interests must be avoided. Outside activities should be pursued in a manner consistent with the primary obligations of University personnel to teaching, research, and service to the public.\nThe potential for conflict of interest and\/or commitment exists when University personnel exercise preferential access to knowledge, and\/or University resources, for personal gain. The appropriate framework for faculty involvement in either commercial or not-for-profit enterprises, including \"faculty companies,\" has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in concert with cognizant University administrators. Mechanisms whereby potential conflicts will be managed must be set forth in a Management Plan approved by the University\u2019s Conflict of Interest Committee and\/or the University Conflict of Interest Official per policy RP06, Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests.\nAs an adjunct activity, consulting should be carried out in a manner consistent with a faculty member's obligation to the University, including his\/her terms of employment. All those individuals who carry the rank of Penn State faculty are allowed to engage in consulting up to a maximum of four days, or 40 hours, per month during their appointment period, per policy\u00a0AC80,\u00a0Private Consulting Practice.

Emeritus Status may be awarded to the President by the Board of Trustees.\nDESIGNATED TITLE CONTINUATION:\nIndividuals holding Distinguished Professorships or University-Named titles will continue such title designations into Emeritus Status. Such continuation of title designation does not carry with it any supplemental or other privileges that were associated with the University-Named appointment during active employment.\nNOTIFICATION OF AWARD OF EMERITUS STATUS:\nA letter and a certificate are sent by the President to each individual awarded Emeritus Status. Copies of these letters are sent to the appropriate dean, chancellor, or academic vice president.\nPRIVILEGES OF EMERITUS STATUS:\nThe following privileges are available to a recipient of Emeritus Status in addition to the privileges accorded all retirees*:\nPenn State Emeritus ID Card\nListing of title, department, campus, and educational affiliation in the Faculty\/Staff Directory\nAdditional parking options may be available through the Parking Office\nPenn State Access Account for Internet services\nRegular Faculty\/Staff privileges at University Libraries\nAccess to University recreational facilities\nFaculty\/Staff discount at Penn State Bookstores\nEducational Privileges for self and eligible dependents\nOffice or laboratory space will be assigned as appropriate to an emeritus faculty member by the home academic department or college in accordance with space available, the emeritus faculty member's productivity and contributions to teaching and research, and policies of the individual units regarding space assignments.\n*Note: The eligibility requirements for the award of Emeritus Status are not intended to supersede the eligibility requirements of HR54, Continuation of Group Insurance After Age 60, Age 65, and After Retirement or Death. The specific eligibility requirements of HR54 must be met in order to qualify for the benefits outlined in that policy.\nREVOCATION OF EMERITUS STATUS:\nAt the sole discretion of the University, Emeritus Status may be revoked at any time. Without limiting such discretion, revocation may occur when it is determined that the individual's conduct, before or after receiving the Emeritus designation, conflicts with the intent and spirit of the designation and\/or causes harm to the University's reputation. The President is authorized to make the decision to revoke Emeritus Status. The President shall inform the affected individual, and shall notify the Board of Trustees, for information purposes, as well as the appropriate dean or administrative officer. A determination specific to the position of President shall be made by the Board of Trustees. This section is intended to confirm the existing \"at will\" nature of Emeritus Status and thus applies to all individuals who currently hold Emeritus Status or may be granted such status in the future.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAC10  - Distinguished Professorships\nAC81  - University-Named Professorships\nAC82  - University-Named Chairs\nAC83  - University Endowed Fellowships\nAC93  - University-Named Dean's Chairs\nAC94  - University-Named Department Head's Chairs\nMost recent changes:\nMay 30, 3018 - Editorial changes to update titles.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\n\nDecember 8, 2015 - Editorial changes.\n\nJune 13, 1964 - New Policy.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nDecember 8, 2015>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nDecember 8, 2015>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nDecember 8, 2015>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy provides the criteria for eligibility and privileges of Emeritus Status."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr47","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Uniforms | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesEmployee Uniforms \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR47\nEmployee Uniforms\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: October 29, 1953\u00a0\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: March 4, 1994\nContents:\nPurpose\nEligibility for University Provided Uniforms\nUsage of Uniforms\nMaintenance and Cost\n\n\nELIGIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY PROVIDED UNIFORMS:\nA uniform for an employee may be provided by the University only when it is necessary:\n a. To maintain exceptionally high standards of sanitation such as in the preparation of foods,> b. To identify persons to the general public or guests of the University such as police, hotel employees, hospital employees, etc., orc. To prevent injury to an employee while performing a hazardous job.\nUSAGE OF UNIFORMS:\nEach employee provided a uniform shall take the necessary steps to protect it from excessive damage and wear. Uniforms issued by the University are to be worn only during working hours. When a uniform is provided, it shall be worn by the employee.\nMAINTENANCE AND COST:\nA required uniform for an employee will be provided by the University at no expense to the employee. The University will not pay partially or fully for either the cost or maintenance of any uniforms that do not meet the above requirements.\nThe interests of separate departments of the University are best served by providing more than one system by which required uniforms may be made available to employees. These systems are (1) the rental of uniforms by the University, or (2) the outright purchase of the uniforms by the University.\nThe cost of the maintenance of uniforms provided by the University will be paid in full by the University. This includes dry cleaning and laundry, and the replacement of worn articles of clothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To specify the University's responsibility in providing and maintaining uniforms for certain groups of employees."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr101","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositions Requiring National Search Process | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesPositions Requiring National Search Process \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR101\nPositions Requiring National Search Process\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: January 14, 2013\u00a0\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: January 14, 2013\nContent:\nPurpose\nPositions Covered by Policy\nDefinitions\nResponsibility\nSearch Process\nUse of a Search Committee\nAdvertising \nExecutive Search Firms\nSearch Waivers \nCross-References\n\n\nPOSITIONS COVERED BY POLICY:\nA national search including national advertising is required for all executive positions, Division I head coaching positions, associate athletic director, and athletic director positions.\nDEFINITIONS:\nAffirmative Action: The Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) enforces Executive Order 11246, as amended; Chapter 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; the affirmative action provisions (Section 4212) of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act, as amended and Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. Taken together, these laws ban discrimination and require the University and its subcontractors to take affirmative action to ensure that all individuals have equal opportunity for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, or status as a Vietnam era or special disabled veteran.\nDiversity and Inclusivity: The University is committed to pursuing excellence through the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff. The University values an educational environment that is dynamic and embraces diversity in backgrounds, ideas, and perspectives. The national search process supports the University's commitment to diversity in the recruitment and selection process.\nEqual Employment Opportunity: Federal and state opportunity legislation prohibits discrimination based on any prohibited characteristic. In accordance with the University's non-discrimination statement, Penn State's employment practices do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, religious creed, gender, disability or handicap, age, genetic information, veteran's status, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\nExecutive Positions: the President of the University, Provost, Sr. Vice President for Finance and Business\/Treasurer, Vice Presidents, Deans of academic colleges, and other senior leadership positions as determined by the President.\nExecutive Search Firm: an external firm retained to assist with the recruitment process typically charging either on a flat fee or percentage of the candidate's first year's earnings basis. The role of the search firm can range from full service (creating the job description\/ advertisements, advertising, recruiting candidates, conducting background checks, communicating with applicants, scheduling interviews and campus visits, confirming offers and assisting in onboarding of candidate) to a smaller scope focused strictly on recruitment of hard-to-find candidates.\nNational Search: an open search for potential candidates for vacancies that includes notification to both internal Penn State and external audiences that applications are being sought for the identified position and that the University encourages qualified individuals from typically underrepresented groups to apply. National searches should include advertising on websites, specifically those targeting underrepresented groups, and\/or in publications appropriate to the specific position.\nRESPONSIBILITY:\nThe next higher administrative office will be identified as the Hiring Executive with responsibilities to evaluate the need for a Search Committee, collaborate with the Office of Human Resources to nationally advertise the vacancy, and engage an executive search firm, when appropriate.\nSEARCH PROCESS:\nUnless a waiver is requested and granted (as defined below), all searches for positions covered by this policy must entail a vigorous national search in addition to an internal posting process. Due to the University's commitment to diversity, searches must include serious efforts to achieve a pool of highly-qualified applicants that include members of underrepresented groups. Searches should be implemented consistent with Policy HR11 - Affirmative Action in Employment at The Pennsylvania State University.\nUSE OF SEARCH COMMITTEE:\nSearch committees are strongly encouraged. If a Search Committee is used, it should be identified by the Hiring Executive and may include faculty, staff, and\/or student members of the college\/unit within which leadership is sought, as well as members from outside of the unit who have direct interests in the selection process. Efforts should be made for Search Committees to include diverse representation including women and members of underrepresented groups, whenever possible. In addition, consideration should be given to representation from multiple departments and\/or locations within and outside of the unit\/college; individuals with knowledge of the substantive area; individuals with demonstrated ability in promoting a deliberative process; and individuals with the ability to effectively encourage inclusion of diverse perspectives.\nIt is important for every member of the Search Committee to thoroughly understand the requirements of the position to be filled, the needs of the department or unit, University policies regarding equal employment opportunity, and the mission of the University in order to assure the prospect of a successful search. The Hiring Executive and\/or Search Committee Chair will \"charge\" the Search Committee with their responsibilities, provide information on the extent of its authority, and provide a clear understanding of the scope and responsibilities of the position being filled.\nThe Search Committee, with the assistance of the Office of Human Resources, will assist in the development of the final job description and advertising description, review applicant materials, participate in the determination of candidates to be interviewed, and interview candidates for potential recommendation of further consideration. The Search Committee will present their evaluations and recommendations of candidates to the Hiring Executive for review and consideration. At the request of either the Search Committee or the Hiring Executive, a meeting to discuss recommendations will be held.\nADVERTISING:\nOne of the most important elements of the recruitment process is creating a broad and diverse applicant pool. In order to encourage highly-qualified applicants, including those from underrepresented groups, to apply for the vacancies, the hiring unit should conduct a national search that includes advertising in a variety of publications including those targeting higher-education, diverse candidate pools, and a variety of professional organizations. Hiring Executives\/Committee Chairs and\/or their Human Resources Representatives should collaborate with the Office of Human Resources to determine the most effective venues to reach highly-qualified and diverse candidates and to appropriately manage advertising expenditures.\nEXECUTIVE SEARCH FIRMS:\nThe Hiring Executive may or may not decide to retain the services of a search firm. If a search firm is used, the Vice President of Human Resources or his\/her representative will work in collaboration with the unit to engage an executive search firm, if appropriate. Contracts\/engagement letters for executive search firm services must be reviewed by the Office of Human Resources prior to commitment and require approval of the Vice President of Human Resources. In addition, contracts\/ engagement letters for executive search firms require the approval of the Executive Vice President and Provost for academic executive positions or the Sr. Vice President for Finance and Business\/Treasurer for non-academic positions. All executive search firms will be required to comply with Penn State's requirements for legal compliance, diversity initiatives, and confidentiality.\nSEARCH WAIVERS:\nThe national search process has been designed to support the University's commitment to affirmative action and to encourage excellence through enlarging the pools of qualified candidates and through diversity; therefore waivers from utilizing this process will only be permitted based on appropriate justification. Senior unit and\/or campus leadership requesting a waiver must provide information detailing the unique situation that would warrant a waiver. Circumstances that may be considered include, but are not limited to: an opportunity to hire an individual with unique and specialized expertise; vacancies that occur due to exigent or unforeseen circumstances that need to be filled immediately; positions that are being filled on an interim basis until a national search can be completed; unique personal situations such as spousal hires; target of opportunity hires that serve underrepresented groups; or reorganizations within a college or unit. Search waivers require the approval of the Vice President of Human Resources (or his\/her designee) or the President of the University.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR01 - Fair Employment Practices\nHR11 - Affirmative Action in Employment at The Pennsylvania State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy defines the positions requiring a national search and the general process for completing that search."},{"university":"psu","name":"bt06","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Student Course-Related Fees and Specific Charges  | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesUniversity Student Course-Related Fees and Specific Charges  \n\n\n\nBudget Policies\n\nBT06\nUniversity Student Course-Related Fees and Specific Charges \nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nUniversity Budget Officer>\nContents:\nPurpose\nUniversity Course-Related Fees and Specific Charges\nGuidelines for Consideration of New University Student-Course Related Fees and Specific Charges\nGuidelines for Consideration of Change In Existing Student-Course Related Fees or Specific Charges\nApproval Process\nFurther Information\n\n\nUNIVERSITY STUDENT COURSE-RELATED FEES AND SPECIFIC CHARGES:\nNew or modified student course-related fees and specific charges will be considered only when the level of service required exceeds that which can be reasonably committed by the University and expected by the student.\nThis policy applies to proposals for new, or changes to existing, general funds student course-related fees and charges, including Study Abroad embedded course and travel fees. Upon approval, new or modified fees and charges will become effective on July 1 each year as a part of the regular general funds budget.\nChanges for fees and specific charges ordinarily will not be considered after the budget for the year becomes operative each July 1. In emergency situations, however, proposals for changes during the interim periods may be presented through channels to the University Budget Office for review and disposition on an exception basis.\nGUIDELINES FOR CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNIVERSITY STUDENT-COURSE RELATED FEES AND SPECIFIC CHARGES:\nA new student course-related fee or specific charge will be considered upon recommendation of the budget executive responsible for the unit proposing the fee. Fee proposals and specific charges endorsed by the Executive Vice President and Provost or Senior Vice President for Finance & Business will be considered for approval by the University Budget Officer.\nReview of proposed new fees and specific charges will be based at all levels on the following considerations:\nThe fee or charge must be reasonable and equitable, and must not be an obstacle to those students who have need for access to the service;\nFees and charges for services beyond basic levels must be posted, or otherwise be made known, to prospective users;\nThe proposed fees and charges should not be presented as a means of increasing departmental income.\nNew student fees, charges, or changes to existing fees in auxiliary enterprises or other restricted funds supported activities, will be submitted through established channels for review and approval of the Executive Vice President and Provost or appropriate Senior Vice President, or designee. Such proposals should be made as a part of annual budget submissions for such activities.\nCharges for attendance at cultural, entertainment, or athletic events are not considered to be student fees or charges in the above context and are governed by other policies. (See Policy AD15, Fees and Charges for Facilities and Services.)\nGUIDELINES FOR CONSIDERATION OF CHANGE IN EXISTING STUDENT COURSE-RELATED FEES OR SPECIFIC CHARGES:\nA change to an existing student course-related fee or charge will be considered upon the recommendation of the budget executive responsible for the unit involved. Changes for fees and specific charges which are endorsed by the Executive Vice President and Provost or Senior Vice President for Finance & Business will be considered for approval by the University Budget Officer.\nThe review and approval for changes to course-related fees or specific charges will be based upon the following considerations and\/or requirements:\nIt must be shown that the service provided by the fee or charge cannot continue without a change. This should be illustrated via the submission of a financial analysis along with a narrative statement.\nThe consequences of eliminating the student service should be indicated in the event the fee or charge is not approved and the service must be discontinued.\nThe change to the fee or charge must not increase the price so as to be an obstacle to those students requiring the service.\nChanges to fees and charges must be posted, or otherwise be made known to the users.\nChanges to fees and charges should not be presented as a means of increasing departmental income.\nAPPROVAL PROCESS:\nThe unit requesting approval must complete and submit the form Submission of Proposal for New or Existing Student Course-Related Fees to the University Budget Officer, attaching all prepared supporting documentation.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the University Budget Officer.\nEffective Date: March 5, 2014\n\tDate Approved: March 4, 2014\n\tDate Published: March 5, 2014\nMost Recent Changes:\nMarch 5, 2014 - Changes made in PURPOSE and UNIVERSITY STUDENT COURSE-RELATED FEES AND SPECIFIC CHARGES sections to reflect that the policy now also covers Study Abroad embedded course and travel fees.

Each program must identify the following:\nPurpose,\ncriteria for eligibility and selection,\nnumber of recipients,\nfrequency of the award,\ndetermination of the type of award, and\nguidelines for presentation of the award.\nThose Employee Reward and Recognition Programs which include an award must be formally documented with review and approval by each of the following prior to initiation of the selection process:\nthe appropriate budget executive,\nthe Financial Officer, and\nthe Human Resources Representative\nThe Financial Officer must review the proposed program with the Corporate Controller's Office to assess the federal tax (IRS) implications.\nELIGIBILITY:\nReward and recognition may be intended for individual employees, groups of employees, employee work-units, or departments. All categories of employees should be represented and considered for employee recognition.\nDue to financial aid considerations, full-time graduate and undergraduate students are not eligible for Employee Reward and Recognition Programs.\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\nSelection criteria must be documented as part of the unit's Employee Reward and Recognition Program. The budget executive may designate an individual or committee, working in conjunction with the Human Resources Representative, to develop specific award standards and selection criteria, and to nominate or select award recipients.\nTYPES OF AWARDS:\nAwards can take many forms and should be appropriate to the achievement being cited. Certain types of employee awards are subject to taxation via the University's payroll system as determined by IRS regulations. General funds may be used for awards such as certificates of achievement, plaques, Nittany Lion statues, special professional development opportunities, etc. (see table below for examples and general funds dollar limitations). General funds may not be used for cash, checks, or gift certificates.\nCash, checks, and gift certificates are permitted only from specifically designated funds.\nAwards not specifically addressed in the table below must be reviewed and approved by the Financial Officer to determine if general funds may be charged and to determine if taxes will apply.\nThe 25-year Service Achievement Award will continue as a University-wide recognition. (Reference Policy HR49.) Given that this award recognizes longevity, it is expected that unit-awards would focus primarily on merit.\nUniversity-wide awards which are presented at the Annual Awards Convocation will continue to be handled through University Relations and are not covered by this Guideline.\nExamples of types of awards, the permissibility to utilize general funds or not,\n\t\t\u200band the requirement to report the award to Payroll for tax reporting and withholding, follow.\nTYPE OF AWARD\nUSE GENERAL FUNDS (Yes or No)\nREPORTABLE (Yes or No)\nCertificates of Achievement\nYes (Limit $100 per award)\nNo\nPlaques\nYes (Limit $100 per award)\nNo\nNittany Lion Statues\nYes (Limit $100 per award)\nNo\nBook ends, Desk sets, etc.\nYes (Limit $100 per award)\nNo\nPenn State Mementos\nYes (Limit $100 per award)\nNo\nSpecial Professional Development Opportunities\nYes\nNo\nChecks and Gift Certificates\nNo\nYes\nAWARD PRESENTATION CEREMONY:\nThe budget executive shall assume the responsibility of making the awards at suitable functions during the year. General Funds may be used for award presentations (maximum of $200 per recipient, unless approved in advance by the Corporate Controller). The costs of the award presentation must be reasonable and appropriate to the achievement being cited. Presentations may be incorporated with professional development, training or other regularly scheduled business sessions, meetings or receptions. Annual or group presentations are encouraged where appropriate.\nGuest lists for awards ceremonies are intended to include the award recipients and a limited number of guests. Any travel costs incurred by the guests (lodging, transportation, and meals outside the immediate presentation)are considered to be personal expenses and not reimbursed by the University.\nAlcoholic beverages may not be charged to general funds (see Policies\u00a0AD18 and FN10).\n EXCEPTIONS:\nAny exception to this Guideline must be approved in advance, in writing, by the budget executive and Corporate Controller (via the Financial Officer).Justification must accompany such requests.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual may have specific application and should be referred to, especially;\nFN10 - Other Business Expenses and Activities\nHR49 - Twenty-Five Year Service Award Program\nEffective Date: December 4, 2000\u00a0\n\tDate Approved: November 30, 2000\u00a0\n\tDate Published: December 4, 2000 (Editorial changes- October 3, 2013)\nMost Recent Changes:\nOctober 3, 2013 - Editorial changes.

The custodian of the operating cash fund is the Financial Officer. There is no requirement for the Financial Officer to maintain an operating cash fund. However, the Financial Officer must provide oversight of all petty cash and change funds for an area even if not provided as an advance through the operating cash fund (See FN04).\nAt University Park, the fund is an imprest cash fund, but may be managed through a non-interest checking account in the custodian\u2019s name with approval of the Assistant Controller.\nAT THE NON-UNIVERSITY PARK locations, the fund may be managed in one of two ways:\nAn imprest cash fund.\nA non-interest bearing checking account in the custodian's name. A minimum of two persons (and a maximum of three) will be authorized to withdraw funds from this account: they are the custodian and one or two other University employees designated by the custodian to sign checks in the custodian's absence.\nTERM OF A FUND:\nAn operating cash fund is established for an indefinite period of time since the requirements of the fund are of a permanent, continuing nature.\nCUSTODY OF A FUND:\nOperating cash funds are established in the name of the custodian of the operating cash fund, generally the Financial Officer. When a new custodian is appointed, the fund is transferred to him or her, and the account is reconciled.\nWhen managed through a checking account, a new account is established in the new custodian\u2019s name at the designated depository bank. The old account at the depository is closed.\nChanges in custodian must be documented through written notice to the Associate Bursar and should include an account reconciliation, signed by both custodians. The Assistant Controller, University Financial Officers should also be copied.\nRESTRICTIONS:\nOperating cash funds are not to be intermingled with other funds or receipts from cash sales, nor are they to be used for cashing personal checks or for making personal advances or loans to employees.\nSAFEGUARDING CASH:\nIt is the custodian's responsibility to make whatever provisions are necessary to safeguard the fund.\nAny amount of cash on hand that exceeds $1,000 must be maintained in an approved safe (fireproof, bolted to floor or immovable). Amounts of $1,000 and under must be maintained in a file safe or reinforced file cabinet with a pad lock and bar that secures all drawers. Cash should not be retained in desk drawers or standard file cabinets since they are easily accessed with nominal forcing or readily available keys.\nDISBURSEMENTS:\nAll disbursements from the fund will be made by the custodian (or person(s) authorized by the custodian) and must have appropriate support as follows:\nCash or a check is disbursed in exchange for Requests for Cash Advance, Requests for Salary Advance or Receipts for Petty Cash Expended.\nIn addition, because of the distance from University Park Mailing Services, the Operating Fund at Non-University Park locations may be used to acquire a nominal supply of postage stamps from the local Post Office for official University business. (This is an exception to procedure #BS2008 University Mailing Services, concerning 'live postage.')\nRECORDS:\nOperating cash fund reconciliations, including bank checking account reconciliations for those managed through an account, will be prepared monthly and filed until reviewed by the Office of Internal Audit.\nREIMBURSEMENT OF A FUND:\nReimbursement of the exact amount of expenditures should be requested by submitting a Special Request for Check (properly approved), with the supporting detail.\nIn addition, if a travel advance was issued by the custodian, the advance should be properly accounted for in the Employee Reimbursement System upon settlement of the travel.\nINCREASING A FUND:\nA custodian may request that his or her operating cash fund be increased, either permanently (charging account 0207) or temporarily (charging account 0206), by submitting a Special Request for Check form, with off-path approval through the Assistant Controller with explanation of the reason for the increase in the form notepad. The Associate Bursar should also be copied on the form.\nDECREASING A FUND:\nIf there is an excess of funds, the custodian will reduce the fund by:\nDepositing the amount of excess cash through a Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR), reducing the advance account 0207 or 0206 (as appropriate) for the named custodian. The Associate Bursar must be copied on the ROCR to assure proper credit to the custodian. The name of the custodian should be clearly indicated in the notepad of the form.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nFN04 - Petty Cash and Change Funds\nEffective Date: August 12, 2014\n\tDate Approved: August 12, 2014\n\tDate Published: August 12, 2014\nMost recent changes:\nAugust 12, 2014- Major revisions throughout the entire policy to reflect current handling of operating cash funds.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Sexual Harassment\u00a0is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwanted, inappropriate, or unconsented to.\u00a0 Sexual Harassment is prohibited at the University.\nFor purposes of student discipline, the term Sexual Harassment is defined in the Student Code of Conduct.\nSexual Harassment committed by an employee or third party can lead to discipline or corrective action when:\nSubmission to such conduct is made implicitly or explicitly a condition for employment, promotion, grades, academic status, or participation in the University\u2019s activities; or\nSubmission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment or academic or other decisions affecting an individual; or\nSuch conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to substantially interfere with the harassed individual\u2019s employment, education or access to University programs, activities and opportunities, or creates a hostile or offensive environment for that individual or others. Whether a hostile environment exists is based on a totality of the circumstances and is evaluated from a subjective and objective perspective.\nb. Gender-Based Harassment\u00a0is behavior consisting of physical or verbal conduct based on gender, sexual orientation, gender-stereotyping, perceived gender, or gender identity, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, when such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it substantially interferes with an individual\u2019s employment, education or ability to participate in or benefit from University programs, activities or opportunities and would detrimentally affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0Gender-Based Harassment may include, but is not limited to, verbal or physical attacks, graphic or written statements, threats, or slurs.\u00a0Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited Gender-Based Harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs and the status of the individuals involved.\n(Note: Policy\u00a0AD91\u00a0defines Sex and\/or Gender-based Discrimination as conduct of any nature that denies an individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employment, education, or living environment, because of the individual\u2019s sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, pregnancy-related condition, gender, perceived gender, or gender identity.\u00a0Conduct that may constitute Sex and\/or Gender-based Discrimination but does not fall within the conduct defined in Policy AD85 is excluded from the definition of Prohibited Conduct in Policy AD85 and is addressed in Policy\u00a0AD91). \u00a0\nc. Sexual Misconduct\u00a0is a form of sexual harassment and refers to sexual offenses including but not limited to rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual exploitation, sexual coercion and any other forms of nonconsensual sexual activity.\u00a0\u00a0Sexual misconduct can be committed by strangers, acquaintances and family members, as well as casual and long-term dating partners.\nSexual assault\u00a0occurs when a person engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a complainant without the victim\u2019s consent, and includes rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape.\u00a0Sexual assault also includes, but is not limited to, attempted or unwanted sexual activity, such as sexual touching and fondling.\u00a0 This includes the touching of an unwilling person\u2019s intimate parts (defined as genitalia, groin, breast or buttock, or clothing covering them), or forcing an unwilling person to touch another\u2019s intimate parts.\nSexual exploitation\u00a0includes, but is not limited to: prostituting another person; non-consensual visual or audio recording of sexual activity; non-consensual display or distribution of photos, images or information of an individual\u2019s sexual activity or intimate body parts; non-consensual voyeurism; coercing someone against their will to engage in sexual activity, or; knowingly transmitting sexually transmitted disease (STD) without disclosing STD status.\nConsent must be informed, freely given and mutual.\u00a0 If coercion, intimidation, threats or physical force are used there is no consent.\u00a0 If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent. This includes impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol or drug consumption, or being asleep or unconscious, where the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was incapacitated.\u00a0 Inducement of incapacitation of another with the intent to affect the ability of an individual to consent or refuse to consent to sexual contact almost always, if not always, negates consent.\u00a0 Silence does not necessarily constitute consent.\u00a0 Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over an alleged victim may be a factor in determining consent.\nd. Stalking\u00a0is a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his\/her safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional distress.\u00a0 Stalking may include repeatedly following, harassing, threatening, or intimidating another by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device or method.\ne. Dating Violence\u00a0means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim.\u00a0 The existence of such a relationship will be based on the reporting party\u2019s statement and with consideration of the length and type of relationship and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\u00a0 Dating violence includes but is not limited to sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse.\u00a0 However, it is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of dating violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.\nDomestic Violence\u00a0includes crimes of violence committed against a victim by:\u00a0 (i) a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; (ii) a person with whom the victim shares a child; (iii) a person who is or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse; (iv) a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim; or (v) any other person (adult or child) against whom the victim is protected under Pennsylvania\u2019s domestic and family violence laws.\u00a0 It is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of domestic violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.\nf. Retaliation, as defined in University Policy\u00a0AD67, is also prohibited by this policy and may subject the individual who retaliates in violation of this or other University policy to discipline or sanctions.\nIn addition to the above, in the case of off-campus Prohibited Conduct that did not occur in the context of a University program or activity, the University will consider the effects of such off-campus conduct when evaluating whether there is a hostile environment on campus and\/or in an off-campus education program or activity.\nCONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS:\nWhile not expressly prohibited, romantic and\/or sexual relationships between faculty and students, staff and students or supervisors and subordinate employees are strongly discouraged.\u00a0 Such relationships have the potential for adverse consequences, including the filing of charges of sexual harassment.\u00a0 Given the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the relationship where one party has the power to give grades, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases or performance evaluations, the consensual nature of the relationship is inherently suspect.\nEven when both parties have consented to the relationship, there may be perceptions of conflicts of interest or unfair treatment of others. Such perceptions undermine the atmosphere of trust essential to the educational process or the employment relationship.

(\u201cUSG\u201d), in an effort to promote national security and to protect the public policy and fiscal interests of the nation, has established certain laws and implemented certain regulations and guidelines to restrict, prevent and\/or inhibit access to certain information, materials, equipment, services and\/or financial resources by or for the benefit of unauthorized foreign nationals.\u00a0 These laws, regulations and guidelines are often collectively referred to as \u201cExport Controls.\u201d\nWhile most activities conducted on campus are excluded or exempted from the application of USG Export Controls, certain activities create a potential for direct and\/or indirect violation of such laws, regulations and guidelines.\u00a0 These complex rules and regulations may impact significant portions of the efforts of University faculty, staff and students as they pursue the research, academic and\/or business goals of the institution.\u00a0 In considering the potential impact of Export Controls on University activities, it is important to remember that the term \u201cExport,\u201d as used in these laws and regulations, is very broadly defined to encompass many activities, such as the mere access to controlled information, materials or equipment by Foreign Persons, as defined in\u00a0ADG09, while in the United States, which are not typically considered by most to be an export.\n\u00a0\nPOLICY:\nIn accordance with AD88 (Code of Responsible Conduct) and AD89 (University Export Compliance), it is the policy of the University to comply with all applicable U.S. laws, including any and all relevant and applicable laws, regulations or guidelines governing the export of goods, information, or services.\nAs part of a proposed research effort, University personnel are responsible for appropriately identifying any potential export-related concerns on the Internal Approval Form (IAF) or by contacting the Office of Sponsored Programs, in advance of proposal submission.\nIn addition, University personnel engaged in funded or non-funded research of any scope and duration are responsible for the periodic and ongoing review of their research efforts to ensure that the research remains in compliance with any and all export control laws and regulations as well as the University policies identified above.\nFundamental Research:\nThe Pennsylvania State University, as a public institution of learning, is committed to the widest possible public dissemination of scientific learning and research results. \u00a0It is the general policy, therefore, that all research activities of the University be conducted without publication restrictions and\/or restrictions on the involvement of any persons, regardless of national origin or citizenship.\u00a0 As a result, most information and data created or used at the University will fall under the definition of \u201cFundamental Research,\u201d as that term is defined in the context of United States Export Controls. \u00a0\nFundamental Research is defined in the National Security Decision Directive 189 (NSDD-189) as \u201cbasic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security concerns.\u201d\u00a0 University research results arising from unrestricted research activities and intended for publication, regardless of whether or not accepted by scientific journals or in other public literature, are considered Fundamental Research.\u00a0\nWhile the general policy of the University is to refuse publication restrictions and\/or restrictions on foreign national participation, exceptions may be made when necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States.\u00a0 In such circumstances, the research conducted by the University and its results may not qualify as Fundamental Research.\u00a0 Typically, University research will not be deemed to qualify as Fundamental Research if the University or the researcher (including any verbal or sidebar agreements between the researcher and a sponsor representative) accepts any of the following:\nA restriction on the publication of research results (i.e., Sponsor requires the right to \u201creview and approve\u201d publications; the right to \u201creview and comment\u201d is not considered a publication restriction);\nA restriction on foreign national participation;\nReceipt of export-controlled information, data or materials from a sponsor or third party;\nA confidentiality provision (often included in non-disclosure agreements), which limits access to or dissemination of project results;\nA project involving the development and delivery of a prototype or other end-use hardware, software, or material.\nGenerally speaking, the results of Fundamental Research performed on campus within the U.S. are not subject to U.S. export control laws, regulations or guidelines (the \u201cFundamental Research Exclusion\u201d). \u00a0In the event that the University accepts a sponsored research project for which the University cannot claim the Fundamental Research Exclusion, the project must be controlled under an appropriate Technology Control Plan (TCP) or equivalent.\u00a0 For specific guidelines on the implementation of a TCP, please refer to University Guideline RAG40.\nFURTHER

This office is also responsible for alien students employed after graduation from another institution during periods of practical training.\nDISSA is also responsible for all aliens in any student status, including those employed after graduation from Penn State during periods of practical training.\nPROCEDURE FOR EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS:\nThe following procedure shall be followed when negotiating for the employment of an alien:\nBefore making a binding commitment concerning employment, the dean or administrative officer will inform DISSA through scholarsadvising@psu.edu of the intent to employ a citizen of another country. DISSA (the International Scholars Advising unit) is responsible for determining whether or not the visa of the alien is such that the alien can legally be considered for University employment. (Because of visa restrictions, some aliens are not permitted to accept employment.)\nDISSA has the responsibility for preparing and submitting petitions to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in accordance with the procedures established by DOL and the DHS. In some instances, a representative of the University may be required to respond, either in writing or in person, to various proceedings. DISSA will represent the University; however, any costs incurred by DISSA will be reimbursed by the appropriate University college or department.\nWhen employment is approved, the DISSA will notify the alien in writing of his\/her visa or immigration status, indicating any time limits or conditions which might affect his\/her employment and will outline any procedures to be followed by the alien in maintaining his\/her status. A copy of this letter will be sent to the appropriate Human Resources Representative or Director of Business Services. Any questions concerning the status of the alien should be directed DISSA at scholarsadvising@psu.edu.\nThe expenses connected with the handling of immigration matters, such as filing fees, express mail, cables, etc., shall be the responsibility of the employing college or department or the alien.\nAn Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9) must be completed and signed as follows:At University Park in DISSA in the University Office of Global Programs in Boucke Building.\nAt the College of Medicine at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in the Office of Human Resources.\nAt all other locations, in the Office of the Director of Business Services.\n\nEMPLOYMENT OF NON-IMMIGRANT ALIEN STUDENTS:\nStudents who seek part-time employment, including graduate assistantships, should first consult with the DISSA (the International Student Advising unit) in the University Office of Global Programs on the 4th floor of Boucke Building to be sure that such employment is permissible, and to complete the I-9 and W-4 forms.\nFull-time employment by the University can be approved during vacation periods if the student was full time during the previous semester and will be full time for the subsequent semester or under Practical Training (see HR84) following completion of the degree program.\nEMPLOYMENT DURING STUDENT STATUS:\nInternational students on F-1 or J-1 visas can be employed on-campus only as long as they are in good academic standing and are enrolled as full-time students. Because employment cannot exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session, International students may not hold 3\/4 time assistantships. Employment may be full-time during vacation periods for students who are eligible and intend to register for the subsequent academic semester.\nOn-campus employment is not permitted after completion of a program unless the student has either completed the transaction procedures from one educational level to another at Penn State or has been authorized for practical training.\nDISSA is responsible for completing the I-9 and W-4 form for international students.\nEMPLOYMENT FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF DEGREE PROGRAM:\nInternational students who are in F-1 or J-1 immigration status are permitted to apply for periods of practical training after completion of their degree programs. Applications must be submitted to the international student adviser in DISSA. Current processing requires completion electronic forms (eForms) by the student through the DISSA system called iStart. and once the student submits the eForm, the academic adviser will received an email with access to an eForm to verify the status of the student. For a full description of Practical Training, refer to HR84.\nBEYOND PRACTICAL\/ACADEMIC TRAINING\nAny foreign national who desires to continue employment with the University upon the completion of a period of practical (or academic) training must make application to DHS for permission to change visa status. This application should be prepared with the concurrence of DISSA\u2019s Scholars Advising unit. DISSA shall be responsible for preparing the necessary petition to be submitted DHS requesting that the foreign national be granted either a J-1 or an H-1B non-immigrant visa. No foreign national shall be permitted to remain on the University payroll without specific approved permission from DHS.\nEMPLOYMENT OF SPOUSE AND CHILDREN OF ALIEN STUDENTS:\nThe spouse and\/or children of aliens on F-1 student visas cannot be employed. There is no exception or special permission available. The spouse and\/or children of aliens on J-1 visas may apply for permission to work from DHS. Such permission, if granted, will be noted on an Employment Authorization Document (EAD)\nThe I-9 for a J-2 with employment authorization is completed by DISSA.\nALIEN INFORMATION REQUEST FORM:\nAn Alien Information Request Form shall be completed by each faculty or staff member who is not a United States citizen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To insure compliance with Federal laws in regard to certification, petitions, immigration and visa matters as related to employment of foreign nationals with the University."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy16","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulations for Bicycles \/ Mopeds \/ Skateboards \/Scooters \/ In-Line Skates \/ Roller Skates | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesRegulations for Bicycles \/ Mopeds \/ Skateboards \/Scooters \/ In-Line Skates \/ Roller Skates \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY16\nRegulations for Bicycles \/ Mopeds \/ Skateboards \/Scooters \/ In-Line Skates \/ Roller Skates\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nBicycles and Mopeds\nOperation\nRegistration\nRegulations\nPenalties\n\nElectric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices\nOperation\nRegistration\nRegulations\nResponsibilities\n\nSkateboards, Scooters, In-Line Skates\/Roller Skates, and Similar Devices\nRegulations\n\nFurther Information\n\n\nDEFINITIONS:\nAcrobatics \u2013 any action on roller blades, in-line skates, bicycles, or any other human powered transportation device in which both blades, skates or wheels are off the ground simultaneously, or where the device is being used in a manner not consistent with normal transportation.\nBicycle - a two-wheeled pedal cycle.\nElectric Personal Assistive Mobility Devices (EPAMDs, aka.

The Evan Pugh University Professors will be selected without regard to college affiliation, program, or location. Candidates for this appointment:\nmust be current, active members of the faculty holding the rank of professor, with at least five years of service to Penn State.\n\t\t\u00a0\nmust be acknowledged leaders in their fields of research or creative activity. This national and international leadership should be documented by (1) pioneering contributions to research published in leading journals or books and creative accomplishments widely recognized for excellence; (2) prestigious awards and citations; and (3) a substantial record of invited lectures or performances delivered at prestigious institutions. Strong preference will be given to candidates who are the founders and developers of their fields, in keeping with the scholarly tradition of the initial Evan Pugh University Professorships awarded by the University.\n\t\t\u00a0\nmust have demonstrated significant leadership in raising the standards of the University with respect to teaching, research or creative activity, and service.\n\t\t\u00a0\nmust have demonstrated excellent teaching skills and contributed significantly to the education of students, both undergraduate and graduate, who subsequently have achieved demonstrated recognition for excellence in their fields.\n\t\t\u00a0\nmust have strong support from colleagues, within and outside the University, who are also recognized as established senior scholars and leaders in their fields.\n\t\t\u00a0\nNOMINATION PROCEDURES:\nIndividual faculty members, departments, or programs may nominate a candidate(s) for the Evan Pugh University Professorship to the dean of the academic college in which the nominee is appointed. Candidates may be nominated for consideration in any of five divisions: (1) arts and humanities, (2) engineering, (3) life and health sciences, (4) physical sciences, and (5) social and behavioral sciences. The purpose of these categories is to facilitate the initial evaluation of nominees, and is not meant to imply that the University will award Evan Pugh University Professorships equally among all divisions. Deans are responsible for appointing committees within their respective colleges to screen Evan Pugh candidates, for preparing the dossier, and for forwarding candidates' dossiers from the college for further consideration. Deans with less than 100 faculty on standing appointments in their colleges may submit one nomination, while deans with more than 100 faculty on standing appointments in their colleges may submit two nominations. A letter of support from the dean must accompany each nomination that is forwarded and the deans, at their discretion, may rank the candidates within any division or in their entirety. It is recommended that the dossiers be prepared with great discretion to avoid disappointment or embarrassment to the nominee should he or she not be selected.The nominee need not be informed and the solicitation of formal external letters is discouraged.\nSELECTION PROCEDURES:\nThe Evan Pugh University Professors will be appointed by the President upon the recommendation of an Advisory Committee of seven eminent faculty members to be named by the President. Three committee members are to be appointed from the incumbent Evan Pugh University Professors; the other four members are to be appointed from among the outstanding faculty of the University. The membership of the Advisory Committee will be broadly representative of the range of scholarly fields represented in the five divisions. The length of each member's term will be two Evan Pugh selection cycles. A member may be appointed to continue serving for a maximum of one additional cycle.\nAPPOINTMENT SCHEDULE:\nThe maximum number of active Evan Pugh University Professorships University-wide shall not exceed one percent of the total number of standing academic appointments. The current maximum number is twenty-five (25).\nIn July of every odd-numbered year (i.e., 1999, 2001, etc.), the current number of active Evan Pugh University Professors will be subtracted from the maximum number. If the remaining number is two (2) or more, the Vice President for Research will meet with the President to discuss the advisability of proceeding with the Evan Pugh University Professorship selection process.\nPROCESS:\nThe Evan Pugh University Professors selection timeline will be as follows (specific deadline dates will be published):\nAugust:\nMemo sent from the Vice President for Research to deans of the academic colleges informing them of the prospective appointment of additional Evan Pugh University Professors and the procedures for sending nominations forward to the Advisory Committee.\nArticle appears in Intercom announcing requests for nominations to be sent to academic deans, with reminders to appear in each issue until the deadline.\nOctober:\nDeadline for submission of nominating materials to the deans of the academic colleges.\nDecember:\nColleges complete internal review of candidates, and dean forwards dossiers of nominated faculty members, with recommendations and priorities, to the Advisory Committee.\nFebruary:\nAdvisory Committee completes initial screening of nominees and requests external letters of reference for short list of finalists.\nMarch:\nAdvisory Committee completes final review of nominees and forwards recommendations of finalists to the President.\nMay\/June:\nPresident announces new Evan Pugh University Professors.\nREMUNERATION:\nThe financial benefits associated with the Professorship are outlined as follows:\n\ta. The annual salary paid each Evan Pugh University Professor by her\/his college program will be supplemented from central University funds in the amount of at least $12,000.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tb. Funds will be made available annually to each Evan Pugh University Professor toward support of her\/his research and\/or creative works as permitted by University general funds. For information regarding the sum available please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\tc. Evan Pugh University Professors participating in a phased retirement plan (HR29) shall have their supplemental salary reduced accordingly. The full departmental allotment will continue to be provided to be used on an unrestricted basis toward their research and\/or creative works. Normally, this arrangement is in effect for a period of time not to exceed 3 years from the start of the phased retirement, at which time the Evan Pugh supplements will end.\nIndividuals holding endowed chairs, professorships, or faculty fellowships may be named Evan Pugh University Professors, but will not receive associated remuneration from the Evan Pugh UniversityProfessorship, unless the other remuneration is less than that provided by the Evan Pugh UniversityProfessorship. In such cases, the faculty member will receive the remuneration provided by the chair, professorship or faculty fellowship, plus a supplement provided by funds in the Office of the Vice President for Research such that the sum is equivalent to that provided for the Evan Pugh University Professorship.\nThese financial benefits will be reviewed every two years, with the expectation of keeping pace with inflation.\nEMERITUS STATUS:\nAn Evan Pugh University Professor may retire from the University with emeritus status, as \"Evan Pugh University Professor, Emeritus\" with no stipend or research support.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR29 - Voluntary Phased Retirement\nUPDATES:\n5\/12\/16 \u2013 Change in title from Evan Pugh Professorships to Evan Pugh University Professorships.

Responsibility to Report Possible Research Misconduct\nAnyone having reason to believe that a member of the faculty, staff or student body has engaged in research misconduct has a responsibility to report pertinent facts in accordance with this policy. The person may discuss the situation with a Budget Administrator or Budget Executive or the Research Integrity Officer or may report the facts through other established reporting procedures, such as the University's ethics hotline. A Budget Administrator or Budget Executive who receives information about possible research misconduct shall inform the Research Integrity Officer. If the circumstances described do not meet the definition of research misconduct, the Research Integrity Officer may refer the individual or allegation to other offices or officials with responsibility for resolving the problem.\nII. Confidentiality\nThe Research Integrity Officer shall endeavor to protect the confidentiality of respondents and complainants, and of research subjects identifiable from research records or evidence, by limiting disclosure to those who need to know in order to carry out a thorough, competent, objective, and fair research misconduct proceeding or as required by law.\nIII. Interim Administrative Actions and Notifying Federal Agencies of Special Circumstances\nThroughout the research misconduct proceeding, the Research Integrity Officer will ensure that warranted interim actions are taken to protect public health, sponsor funds and equipment, and the integrity of the research process, and to ensure that the purposes of the research activity and the financial assistance are carried out.\u00a0 Such actions may include, for example, additional monitoring of the research process and the handling of federal funds and equipment, reassignment of personnel or of responsibility for handling federal funds and equipment, additional review of research data and results, and delay in publication.\nTo the extent required by regulation or by the sponsor, the Research Integrity Officer shall, at any time during a research misconduct proceeding, notify appropriate federal or other officials of facts that may be relevant to protect public health, federal or other sponsor funds and equipment, and the integrity of the sponsor-supported research process and shall make other interim reports required by research sponsors.1\n1\u00a0Regulations applicable to research misconduct allegations under U.S. Public Health Service (\u201cPHS\u201d) jurisdiction require immediate notification of the PHS Office of Research Integrity (\u201cORI\u201d) if the University has reason to believe that any of the following conditions exist: (1) health or safety of the public is at risk, including an immediate need to protect human or animal subjects; (2) U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) resources or interests are threatened; (3) research activities should be suspended; (4) there is a reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law; (5) federal action is required to protect the interests of those involved in the research misconduct proceeding; (6) the University believes the research misconduct proceeding may be made public prematurely (so that HHS may take appropriate steps to safeguard evidence and protect the rights of those involved); or (7) the research community or public should be informed.\u00a0 42 C.F.R. 93.318.\u00a0 Regulations applicable to research misconduct allegations under National Science Foundation (\u201cNSF\u201d) jurisdiction require prompt notification of the NSF Office of Inspector General (\u201cNSF OIG\u201d) should the University become aware during an Inquiry or Investigation that: (1) Public health or safety is at risk; (2) NSF\u2019s resources, reputation, or other interests need protecting; (3) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law; (4) Research activities should be suspended; (5) Federal action may be needed to protect the interests of a subject of the Investigation or of others potentially affected; or (6) The scientific community or the public should be informed. 45 C.F.R. 689.4(c).\nPROCEDURE:\nI. Conducting the Inquiry\nA. Assessment of Allegations\nAs soon as practicable after receiving an allegation of research misconduct, the Research Integrity Officer will assess the allegation to determine whether it (1) falls within the definition of research misconduct in this Policy and any applicable federal regulations, and (2) is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be identified. If both of these criteria are met, an Inquiry will be conducted unless the Research Integrity Officer determines that unusual circumstances exist that make an inquiry infeasible or otherwise not warranted (such as that the conduct at issue is too old; see 42 CFR 93.105).\nB. Notice to Respondent\nAt the time of or before beginning an Inquiry, the Research Integrity Officer shall make a good faith effort to notify the respondent in writing of the decision to conduct an Inquiry. If the Inquiry subsequently identifies additional respondents, they shall also be notified in writing.\u00a0\nC. Sequestration of the Research Records\nOn or before the date on which the respondent is notified, or the Inquiry begins, whichever is earlier, the Research Integrity Officer shall take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the research records and evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding, inventory the records and evidence, and sequester them in a secure manner. Where the research records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies have evidentiary value substantially equivalent to that of the instruments.\nD. Appointment of the Inquiry Committee\nThe Research Integrity Officer is responsible for conducting, or designating others to conduct, the Inquiry.2\u00a0In cases where the allegations and apparent evidence are straightforward, the Research Integrity Officer may choose to conduct the Inquiry directly or designate another qualified individual, referred to as the inquiry official, to do so. The inquiry official shall not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of interest in relation to the Inquiry and should have appropriate scientific expertise to evaluate the evidence and issues related to the allegation and conduct the Inquiry.\n2 Inquiry or Investigation that: (1) Public health or safety is at risk; (2) NSF's resources, reputation, or other interests need protecting; (3) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law; (4) Research activities should be suspended; (5) Federal action may be needed to protect the interests of a subject of the Investigation or of others potentially affected; or (6) The scientific community or the public should be informed. 45 C.F.R. 689.4(c).\nIn complex cases, the Research Integrity Officer, in consultation with other University officials, as appropriate, will normally appoint a committee of three or more persons, including a committee chair, to conduct the Inquiry. Where warranted, the Research Integrity Officer may determine that a smaller or larger committee is appropriate. The members of the inquiry committee shall consist of individuals who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of interest in relation to the Inquiry and should include individuals with the appropriate scientific expertise to evaluate the evidence and issues related to the allegation and conduct the Inquiry. When necessary to secure expertise or to avoid conflicts of interest, the Research Integrity Officer may select committee members from outside the University.\nThe Research Integrity Officer, in consultation with the inquiry committee, will determine whether additional experts are needed to provide special expertise to the inquiry committee regarding the analysis of specific evidence. If experts are utilized, their role will be advisory to the inquiry committee.\nThe respondent shall have an opportunity to object to the inquiry official or a proposed member of the inquiry committee based upon a personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest, by submitting written objections to the Research Integrity Officer no more than 10 days following notification of the proposed inquiry official or committee membership. The Research Integrity Officer makes the final determination as to whether a conflict exists.\u00a0\nE. Charge to the Inquiry Committee\nThe Research Integrity Officer will prepare a charge to the inquiry official or inquiry committee that: (1) sets forth the time for completion of the Inquiry; (2) describes the allegations and any related issues identified during the allegation assessment; (3) states that the purpose of the Inquiry is to conduct an initial review of the evidence to determine whether an Investigation is warranted, not to determine whether research misconduct definitely occurred or who was responsible; (4) states the criteria for determining that an Investigation is warranted; and (5) states that the inquiry official or inquiry committee is responsible for preparing or directing the preparation of a written report of the Inquiry that meets the requirements of Section V of this Policy.\nThe Research Integrity Officer may choose to meet with the inquiry official or inquiry committee to review the charge, discuss the allegations, discuss the appropriate procedures for conducting the Inquiry, assist the inquiry official or committee with organizing plans for the Inquiry, and answer any questions raised by the inquiry official or committee. The Research Integrity Officer or his or her designee will be available throughout the Inquiry to advise the inquiry official or inquiry committee as needed.\u00a0\nF. Inquiry Process\nThe purpose of the Inquiry is to conduct an initial review of the available evidence to determine whether to conduct an Investigation. The purpose of the Inquiry is not to decide whether research misconduct definitely occurred, determine who committed the research misconduct or conduct exhaustive interviews and analysis. If interviews are conducted as part of the Inquiry, each interview shall be recorded or transcribed, and the recording or transcript shall be provided to the interviewee for correction and shall be included, with any written corrections, in the record of the Inquiry.\nAfter evaluation of the evidence, the inquiry official or inquiry committee will consult with the Research Integrity Officer and decide whether to recommend that an Investigation is warranted. An Investigation is warranted if: (1) there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the allegation falls within the definition of research misconduct in this Policy and (2) preliminary information-gathering and preliminary fact-finding from the Inquiry indicate that the allegation may have substance.\nIf the respondent admits research misconduct, a determination of misconduct may be made at or before the Inquiry stage if all relevant issues are resolved. In that case, the Research Integrity Officer, in consultation with the Vice President for Research and other appropriate University officials, shall promptly consult with any appropriate federal agencies to determine the next steps that should be taken.\u00a0\nG. Time for Completion\nThe Inquiry, including preparation of the final inquiry report and the decision of the Vice President for Research on whether an Investigation is warranted, must be completed within 60 days of its initiation unless the Research Integrity Officer determines that circumstances warrant a longer period. If the Inquiry takes longer than 60 days, and the Research Integrity Officer approves an extension, the Inquiry record shall include documentation of the reasons for exceeding the 60-day period.\u00a0\nII. The Inquiry Report\nA. Elements of the Inquiry Report\nA written inquiry report shall be prepared that includes the following information: (1) the name and position of the respondent; (2) a description of the allegations of research misconduct; (3) pertinent federal agency support, including, for example, grant numbers, grant applications, contracts, and publications listing such support; (4) the basis for recommending or not recommending that the allegations warrant an Investigation; and (5) any written comments on the draft report by the respondent or the complainant.\nThe inquiry report should also include: the names and titles of the inquiry official or committee members and experts who conducted the Inquiry; a summary of the inquiry process used; a list of the research records reviewed; and whether any other actions should be taken if an Investigation is not recommended. The inquiry report shall either be signed by the inquiry official or by each member of the inquiry committee or shall include other written evidence of each person's concurrence or non-concurrence with the findings and conclusions of the Inquiry.\nB. Opportunity to Comment on the Inquiry Report\nThe Research Integrity Officer shall provide the respondent with a copy of the draft inquiry report and, concurrently, with a copy of any applicable federal research misconduct policy. The respondent shall be provided with an opportunity to review and comment on the inquiry report. Any comments from the respondent must be in writing and received within 10 days of his\/her receipt of the inquiry report and will be attached to the report. Based on the comments, the inquiry committee may revise the draft report as appropriate and prepare it in final form. The Research Integrity Officer will deliver the final report to the Vice President for Research.\nThe Research Integrity Officer may provide the complainant with relevant portions of the inquiry report for comment. Any comments from the complainant must be in writing and received within 10 days of his\/her receipt of the inquiry report.\u00a0\nC. Decision and Notification\n1. Decision by the Vice President for Research\nThe Research Integrity Officer will transmit the final inquiry report and any written comments to the Vice President for Research, who will determine in writing whether an Investigation is warranted. The Inquiry is complete when the Vice President for Research makes this determination.\u00a0\n2. Notice to Respondent and Complainant\nThe Research Integrity Officer shall notify the respondent whether the Inquiry found that an Investigation is warranted. The notice shall include a copy of the inquiry report and include a copy of or refer to this Policy and any applicable federal research misconduct policy.\u00a0\n3. Notice to Applicable Sponsor or Federal Agency\nThe Research Integrity Officer shall provide to applicable sponsors or federal agencies any required reports regarding the Inquiry and decision to initiate an Investigation. For cases involving ORI jurisdiction, within 30 days of the Vice President for Research's decision that an Investigation is warranted, but not later than the date the Investigation begins, the Research Integrity Officer shall provide ORI with the Vice President for Research's written decision and a copy of the inquiry report. The Research Integrity Officer will also notify University officials who need to know of the Vice President for Research's decision.\u00a0\n4. Documentation of Decision Not to Investigate\nIf the Vice President for Research decides that an Investigation is not warranted, the Research Integrity Officer shall secure and maintain, for seven years after the termination of the Inquiry, sufficiently detailed documentation of the Inquiry to permit a later assessment by supporting federal agencies of the reasons why an Investigation was not conducted. These documents shall be provided to authorized federal personnel upon request.\u00a0\nIII. Conducting the Investigation\nInitiation and Purpose\nThe Investigation shall begin within 30 days after the Vice President for Research's determination that an Investigation is warranted. The purpose of the Investigation is to develop a factual record by exploring the allegations in detail and examining the evidence in depth, leading to findings on whether research misconduct has been committed, by whom, and to what extent. The Investigation will also determine whether there are additional instances of possible research misconduct that would justify broadening the scope beyond the initial allegations. The findings of the Investigation shall be set forth in an investigation report.\u00a0\nA. Notice to Respondent\nWithin a reasonable time after determining that an Investigation is warranted, but before the Investigation begins, the Research Integrity Officer shall notify the respondent in writing of the allegations to be investigated. If allegations not addressed during the Inquiry or in the initial notice of the Investigation are pursued, the Research Integrity Officer shall give the respondent written notice of any such new allegations.\u00a0\nB.\u00a0Sequestration of the Research Records\nBefore or at the time the University notifies the respondent of the Investigation, the Research Integrity Officer shall take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of and sequester in a secure manner all research records and evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding that were not previously sequestered during the Inquiry. Where the research records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent, in evidentiary value, to the instruments. If additional items become known or relevant during the Investigation, the Research Integrity Officer shall take reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of those records.\u00a0\nC. Appointment of the Investigation Committee\nAs soon as practicable after the Vice President for Research determines that an Investigation is warranted, the Research Integrity Officer, in consultation with other University officials, as appropriate, will appoint an investigation committee and committee chair, which will conduct the Investigation.\nThe investigation committee shall consist of individuals who did not serve on the inquiry committee and who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of interest in relation to the Investigation. Investigation committee members should have appropriate scientific expertise to evaluate the evidence and issues related to the allegation, interview the respondent and complainant, and conduct the Investigation. When necessary to secure expertise or to avoid conflicts of interest, the Research Integrity Officer may select committee members from outside the University. The Research Integrity Officer may not serve as a member of the investigation committee.\nThe respondent shall have an opportunity to object to proposed members of the investigation committee based upon personal, professional or financial conflict of interest, by submitting written objections to the Research Integrity Officer no more than 10 days following notification regarding the committee membership. The Research Integrity Officer makes the final determination as to whether a conflict exists.\u00a0\nD. Charge to the Investigation Committee\nThe Research Integrity Officer will define the subject matter of the Investigation in a written charge to the investigation committee that: (1) describes the allegations and related issues identified during the Inquiry; (2) identifies the respondent; (3) informs the investigation committee that it must conduct the Investigation as prescribed in this Policy; (4) defines research misconduct; (5) informs the investigation committee that it must evaluate the evidence and testimony to determine whether, based on a preponderance of the evidence, research misconduct occurred and, if so, the type and extent and who was responsible; and (6) informs the investigation committee that it must prepare or direct the preparation of a written investigation report that meets the requirements of Section VII.A.\nThe Research Integrity Officer may choose to meet with the investigation committee to review the charge, the inquiry report, and prescribed procedures and standards for the conduct of the Investigation, including the necessity for confidentiality and for developing a specific Investigation plan.\nThe investigation committee shall be provided with a copy of this Policy and any applicable federal research misconduct policy. The Research Integrity Officer or designee will ordinarily be available throughout the Investigation to advise the investigation committee as needed.\u00a0\nE. Investigation Process\nThe investigation committee and the Research Integrity Officer shall:\nUse diligent efforts to ensure that the Investigation is thorough and sufficiently documented and includes examination of all research records and evidence relevant to reaching a decision on the merits of each allegation;\nTake reasonable steps to ensure an impartial and unbiased Investigation to the maximum extent practical, including participation of persons with appropriate scientific expertise who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of interest with those involved with the Inquiry or Investigation;\nInterview each respondent, complainant, and any other available person who has been reasonably identified as having information regarding any relevant aspects of the Investigation, including witnesses identified by the respondent, and record and transcribe each interview, provide the recording or transcript to the interviewee for correction, and include the recording or transcript, and any written corrections, in the record of the Investigation; and\nPursue diligently all significant issues and leads discovered that are determined relevant to the Investigation, including any evidence of additional instances of possible research misconduct, and continue the Investigation to completion.\nF. Standard for Making a Finding of Research Misconduct\nIn order to make a finding of research misconduct, the investigation committee must find by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) research misconduct occurred, as defined in this Policy or applicable federal agency policy; (2) the research misconduct is a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community; and (3) the respondent committed the research misconduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\nThe Research Integrity Officer will advise the investigation committee of any additional applicable regulatory standards for making a finding of research misconduct.\u00a0 (See, for example, 42 CFR 93.106.)\nG. Time for Completion\nThe Investigation shall ordinarily be completed within 120 days of its initiation, including conducting the Investigation, preparing the report of findings, providing the draft report for comment, and sending the final report to any applicable federal agency. However, if the Research Integrity Officer determines that the Investigation will not be completed within the 120-day period, or as requested by the applicable agency, he\/she shall submit to the applicable agency, or if no agency is involved, to the Vice President for Research, a written request for an extension setting forth the reasons for the delay.\nIV. The Investigation Report\nA. Elements of the Investigation Report\nThe investigation committee and the Research Integrity Officer are responsible for preparing a written investigation report which shall: (1) describe the nature of the allegation of research misconduct; (2) describe and document any federal or private funding, including, for example, any grant numbers, grant applications, contracts, and publications listing any such support; (3) describe the specific allegations of research misconduct considered in the Investigation; (4) include a copy of this Policy; and (5) identify and summarize the research records and evidence reviewed and identify any evidence taken into custody but not reviewed.\u00a0\nThe report shall also include a statement of findings for each separate allegation of research misconduct identified during the Investigation. Each statement of findings shall provide a decision as to whether misconduct did or did not occur, and if so --\nIdentify whether the research misconduct was:falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism,\na significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community, and\ncommitted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly;\n\nSummarize the facts and the analysis that support the conclusion and consider the merits of any reasonable explanation by the respondent;\u00a0\nIdentify specifically any pertinent federal support or proposals (reports to ORI shall include current support from, and known applications or proposals for support to, PHS as well as other federal agencies);\u00a0\nIdentify whether publications need correction or retraction; and\u00a0\nIdentify the person(s) responsible for the misconduct.\u00a0\nThe investigation report shall either be signed by each member of the investigation committee or shall include other written evidence of each member's concurrence or non-concurrence with the findings and conclusions of the Investigation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nB. Comments on the Draft Investigation Report and Access to Evidence\nRespondent\nThe Research Integrity Officer shall provide the respondent with a copy of the draft investigation report for comment, and shall provide the respondent, concurrently, with a copy of, or supervised access to, the evidence on which the report is based. The respondent shall be allowed 30 days to review the draft report and submit written comments to the Research Integrity Officer. The respondent's comments shall be taken into consideration when preparing the final investigation report and shall be attached to the final report.\n\nComplainant\nThe Research Integrity Officer may provide the complainant with a copy of the draft investigation report, or relevant portions of it, for comment. If provided with a copy of the report, the complainant's comments must be in writing and submitted within 30 days of the date on which he\/she received the draft report. Comments received from the complainant shall be taken into consideration in preparing the final investigation report and shall be attached to the final report.\n\nConfidentiality\nIn distributing the draft report, or portions thereof, to the respondent or complainant, the Research Integrity Officer will inform the recipient of the confidentiality under which the draft report is made available and may establish reasonable conditions to ensure such confidentiality. For example, the Research Integrity Officer may require that the recipient sign a confidentiality agreement.\n\nC. Decision by the Vice President for Research\nThe Research Integrity Officer will assist the investigation committee in finalizing the draft investigation report, including ensuring that the respondent's and, in appropriate cases, the complainant's written comments are included and considered. The Research Integrity Officer will transmit the final investigation report to the Vice President for Research, who will determine in writing: (1) whether the University accepts the Investigation's findings; and (2) the appropriate internal actions to be taken or recommended in response to the accepted findings of research misconduct. If the Vice President for Research's determination varies from the findings of the investigation committee, the Vice President for Research will, as part of his\/her written determination, explain in detail the basis for rendering a decision different from the findings of the investigation committee. Alternatively, the Vice President for Research may return the report to the investigation committee with a request for further fact-finding or analysis.\nWhen a final decision on the case has been reached, the Research Integrity Officer will normally notify both the respondent and the complainant in writing. The Research Integrity Officer is also responsible for ensuring compliance with all notification requirements of funding or sponsoring agencies. The Vice President for Research in consultation as appropriate with the Research Integrity Officer and other University officials will determine whether law enforcement agencies, professional societies, professional licensing boards, editors of journals in which falsified reports may have been published, collaborators of the respondent in the work, or other relevant parties should be notified of the outcome of the case.\nD. Notice to Applicable Federal Agencies of University Findings and Actions\nUnless an extension has been granted, within 120 days of beginning the Investigation, the Research Integrity Officer shall submit to any applicable federal agency a copy of the final investigation report with attachments; a statement of whether the University accepts the findings of the investigation report; a statement of whether the University found research misconduct and, if so, who committed the misconduct; and, if required by the agency, a description of any pending or completed administrative actions against the respondent.\u00a0\nE. Maintaining Records for Review by Federal Agencies\nThe Research Integrity Officer shall maintain, and upon request, provide to authorized federal officials, records of the research misconduct proceedings, including: (1) records secured by the University for the Inquiry and Investigation; (2) documentation of the determination of irrelevant or duplicate records; (3) the inquiry report and final documents produced in the course of preparing that report, including the documentation of any decision not to investigate; and (4) the investigation report and the records in support of that report, including the recording or transcript of each interview conducted pursuant to this Policy.\nUnless custody has been transferred to the applicable federal agency or the agency has advised the University, in writing, that the records no longer need to be retained, these records shall be maintained in a secure manner for seven years after the later of completion of the proceeding or the completion of any federal agency proceeding involving the research misconduct allegation.\u00a0\nThe Research Integrity Officer is also responsible for providing any information, documentation, research records, evidence, or clarification requested by authorized federal officials to carry out their review of an allegation of research misconduct or of the University's handling of such an allegation.\nV. Completion of Cases and Reporting Premature Closures to Applicable Federal Agencies\nGenerally, all Inquiries and Investigations will be carried through to completion and all significant issues will be pursued diligently. The Research Integrity Officer shall, if required by such agency, notify any applicable federal agency in advance if there are plans to close a case at the Inquiry or Investigation stage on the basis that the respondent has admitted guilt, a settlement with the respondent has been reached, or for any other reason except that: (1) no notification to federal agencies need be provided when a case is closed after an Inquiry that finds pursuant to Section IV.F that an Investigation is not warranted; and (2) if an Investigation is completed, the University's findings must be reported as specified under Section VII.D of this Policy.\u00a0\nVI. Internal Administrative Actions\nIf the Vice President for Research determines that a finding of research misconduct is substantiated, the University, through the Vice President for Research, the Budget Executive, the Budget Administrator or other appropriate official, may adopt sanctions, which may include, for example:\u00a0\nRe-training;\nUnannounced or announced audits;\nA letter of reprimand or admonishment to be included in respondent\u2019s file;\nSupervision or monitoring of future work, including a requirement for certification by senior personnel that a person\u2019s work met specified conditions;\nRemoval from the research project in question;\nFormal notification of sponsoring agencies, funding sources, co-authors, co-investigators, collaborators or journal editors;\nWithdrawal or correction of pending abstracts and papers emanating from the research where research misconduct was found;\nFormal withdrawal of pending applications for research support;\nPublic announcements; and\/or\nRestitution of funds.\nIf the Vice President for Research determines that a finding of research misconduct is substantiated, the Vice President for Research may also recommend to the Budget Executive or other appropriate University official, disciplinary sanctions, which may include, for example:\nProbation or suspension;\nInitiation of steps leading to possible impact on salary; and\/or\nInitiation of steps leading to possible termination of employment.\nNone of these sanctions limits the authority of the funding sponsor to impose its own sanctions.\nVII. Other Considerations\nA. Protecting the Respondent\nRespondents may consult with legal counsel or a non-lawyer personal adviser (who is not a principal or witness in the case) to seek advice. During research misconduct proceedings, the respondent may be accompanied by counsel or a personal adviser at interviews and meetings, but the lawyer or personal adviser's role will be limited to counseling the respondent, and the respondent will be responsible for answering all questions.\nAs requested and appropriate, the Research Integrity Officer and other University officials shall make all reasonable and practical efforts to protect or restore the reputation of persons alleged to have engaged in research misconduct but against whom no finding of research misconduct is made. Depending on the particular circumstances and the views of the respondent, the Research Integrity Officer should consider whether to notify those individuals aware of or involved in the research misconduct proceeding of the final outcome, publicize the final outcome in any forum in which the allegation of research misconduct was previously publicized, and\/or expunge references to the research misconduct allegation from the respondent's personnel file.\nB. Protecting the Complainant, Witnesses and Committee Members\nUniversity faculty, staff, and students may not retaliate in any way against complainants, witnesses, or committee members. Faculty, staff, and students should immediately report any alleged or apparent retaliation against complainants, witnesses, or committee members to the Research Integrity Officer.\nDuring the research misconduct proceeding and upon its completion, regardless of whether or not the University or a federal agency determines that research misconduct occurred, the Research Integrity Officer shall undertake all reasonable and practical efforts to protect the position and reputation of, or to counter potential or actual retaliation against, any complainant who made allegations of research misconduct in good faith and of any witnesses and committee members who cooperate in good faith with the research misconduct proceeding.\nC. Allegations Not Made in Good Faith\nIf relevant, the Vice President for Research will determine whether the complainant's allegations of research misconduct were made in good faith, or whether a witness or committee member acted in good faith. If the Vice President for Research determines that the complainant knowingly made a false allegation of research misconduct, the Vice President for Research shall determine whether any administrative action will be taken against the complainant or whether any disciplinary action against the complainant will be recommended to the Budget Executive or other appropriate University official.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections.\nCROSS-REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD47\u00a0- General Standards of Professional Ethics\nIP01\u00a0- Ownership and Management of Intellectual Property\nRA12\u00a0- Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurial Activity (Faculty Research)\nRP03\u00a0- The Use of Human Participants in Research (Formerly RA14)\nEffective Date: June 8, 2015\n\tDate Approved: June 4, 2015\n\tDate Published: June 8, 2015\n\u00a0\nMost Recent Changes:\nJune 8, 2015 - This policy was previously a Research Administration policy, RA10.

Also, in a University community, it is inevitable that professional employees will want to contact elected officials on behalf of their professional societies. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the right of individuals to these appropriate contacts. Rather, the intent is to ensure that official University positions\/priorities are expressed by designated representatives of the Office of the President.Further, with the increasing number of official visits to the campuses by state and federal officials, and requests for information, reports, and statistics, it has become necessary to consider ways in which such visits and requests can better be coordinated. Finally, state and federal lobbying disclosure laws impose registration and reporting obligations on the University with respect to lobbying activities undertaken on the University's behalf. This policy is intended to assist the University in meeting these obligations."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad51","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of Outdoor Areas for Expressive Activities | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesUse of Outdoor Areas for Expressive Activities \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD51\nUse of Outdoor Areas for Expressive Activities\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nLocations for Expressive Activity\nReservation of Location\nNon-University Groups\nRequirements for Use\nResidence Hall Areas\nOther University Campuses and Property\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\n\nLOCATIONS FOR EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY:\nBased upon careful study, the following areas of the University Park Campus have been designated as areas suitable for expressive activity:\nOld Main front patio\nAllen Street Gate Plaza\nWillard Building patio area between Willard and Obelisk\nPalmer Art Museum Plaza\nNorthwest corner of Shortlidge Rd. and College Avenue\nFisher Plaza\nIST Plaza\nPattee Library Mall entrance plaza\nHUB-Robeson - Rear sidewalk pad (not the Patio)\nHUB-Robeson - Lawn\nOsmond Fountain Area (after 5pm)\nArea under the Willaman Gateway to the Life Sciences\nAt other University locations, the office of the Chancellor, Dean, or other administrator in charge should be consulted to identify the sites suitable for expressive activity.\nGroups should consider such factors as the number of people involved in the activity, how much space will be required, and the anticipated time and duration of the activity when selecting a location.\nRESERVATION OF LOCATION:\nRegistered student organizations, or a group of ten or more University students, faculty or staff, may reserve any one of the identified locations for the use of the group, subject to the following:\nAll locations (except for Osmond Fountain) may be reserved between the hours of 8:00a.m. and 5:00p.m.\nThere are selected areas that can be reserved for hours other than 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m..

All meters must be paid during the posted hours of reservation on the lot entrance sign.\nShort Term Parking with Flasher Spaces\nAll short term parking spaces on campus require the use of emergency flashers. Please read all signs carefully to see what the maximum time allowed is for that particular space.\nFlashers are never valid at single\/multi-space meters or along curbs or on sidewalks. They also do not authorize parking while a vehicle is hindering\/damaging university operations or property, obstructing roadways or designated handicap spaces, wheelchair ramp laydown (hashed out) areas, or reserved spaces.

All parking regulations remain in effect, regardless of whether or not classes are in session.\nGeneral Information\nVehicles parked on campus are at the owner\u2019s risk. The University assumes no liability for vehicles parked on Penn State property.\nService\/delivery permits are required to park in service\/delivery spaces. These spaces are designated by signs and\/or yellow painted lines. Only service\/delivery companies may purchase these permits.\nAll parts of the vehicle must be inside the designated parking space; generally indicated by two white lines. (Note: Some spaces also include a back line.) Parking in grassed areas is not permitted unless at the direction of special event parking staff.\nAny vehicle not parked in a designated legal space is subject to ticketing and\/or towing at the owner's expense.\nAny vehicle parked along curbs or on sidewalks, hindering\/damaging University operations or property, or obstructing roadways, designated handicap spaces, wheelchair ramp laydown (hashed out) areas, and reserved spaces is subject to ticketing and\/or towing at the owner's expense.\nParking is not permitted in Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) spaces without a state-issued handicap placard and a PSU parking permit for the designated lot (additional fees may be assessed). The ramp laydown (hashed out) area adjacent to the space is considered part of the space and will be enforced accordingly.\nReserved spaces are reserved 24 hours a day, 7 days a week unless otherwise noted on the sign.

After 30 days, tickets become citations and are sent to the District Justice where additional court fees will be assessed.\nAll tickets written for fraudulent\/altered\/unauthorized use of a permit carry severe penalties that include, but are not limited to, a large fine and revocation of parking privileges. It is also possible that charges of theft of services will be filed by University Police.

An Export Review that is required at proposal stage must be completed prior to proposal submission. An Export Review that is required at award stage must be completed prior to award acceptance and prior to ANY expenditure of project award funds, including advanced funds.\nINTERNAL APPROVAL FORM (IAF) \u2013 An electronic form that is completed and signed by all participating investigators and their respective academic or institute administrators, as a first step in the sponsored project proposal submission process. The form prompts the investigator(s) to disclose various project demographics, project related compliance requirements, as well as significant financial or business interests.\nONLINE EXPORT COMPLIANCE TRAINING (CITI Program) \u2013 As part of the University\u2019s documentation of the U.S. Government\u2019s recommended export compliance awareness training for faculty and staff, the University has adopted an online educational tool entitled \u201cCollaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI).\u201d Effective January 1, 2015, all project personnel who are included as signatories on a Technology Control Plan (TCP) shall be required to complete the relevant modules of the TCP Required Training for Export Control. Online Export Compliance Training must be completed prior to the full execution of the TCP, and is valid for a three (3) year period. The CITI Program can be accessed online at citi.psu.edu.\nSECURITY MEETING\u2013 A security meeting is necessitated when the University agrees to accept a Controlled Project (as defined under Restricted\/Controlled Projects herein). Such meetings are hosted by the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) and attended by project personnel, and including as necessary, the following administrative and compliance personnel -- University Export Compliance Officer, OSP Export Committee Chair, College\/Unit\/VPR Information Technology representatives, College Research Office representative, OSP contract negotiator and OSP Compliance Coordinator. Items discussed at a Security Meeting include an overview of the Project and details regarding the implementation and finalization of a Technology Control Plan (TCP).\nTECHNOLOGY CONTROL PLAN (TCP) \u2013 A TCP is a detailed security plan required for all Controlled Projects that is necessitated by the scope of work, or by the terms and conditions of the agreement which may contain certain restrictions, such as foreign national participation, publication restrictions, receipt of export-controlled information, technical data or materials from a sponsor or third party, or the development and delivery of a prototype or other end-use hardware, software or material. Should foreign national participation be essential to the project, the University, under certain circumstances, may apply for a license to the U.S. Department of State. Security measures typically outlined in a TCP are:\nPurpose of controls\nPhysical Security Provisions\nComputer Security Provisions\nPotential License Requirements\nTCP Audit\/Monitoring\nCloseout and Disposition\nAdditional definitions related to Export Compliance can be found in University Policy ADG09.\nGUIDELINES:\nThe University is committed to performing Fundamental Research (as defined in University Policy RA40) in an effort to provide the widest possible public dissemination of scientific learning and research results. As part of its regular review of sponsored research efforts, the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) staff will evaluate any export compliance concerns with proposed or awarded projects.\nSome indicators that research may be impacted by U.S. export laws, regulations and guidelines and thus may require an Export Review include, but may not be limited to, the following:\nForeign Sponsors\nForeign Subrecipients or Consultants\nForeign Travel (including conference attendance and\/or research collaboration)\nForeign Visitors\nForeign Deliverables (other than technical reports)\nAnticipated or actual receipt of equipment, materials, data or software expressly identified as export controlled by the provider\nContractual provisions restricting publication and\/or foreign national involvement\nProposals and Awards through IAF System\nAs part of the IAF submission process, investigators will be asked to identify potential export compliance-related triggers. This will enable OSP to perform an Export Review to determine whether or not a project will be impacted by U.S. export laws, regulations and guidelines. The IAF system is designed to require the completion of various compliance questions, including those related to export controls, before the submission of a proposal and\/or the acceptance of a subsequent award. It is important that faculty\/staff who are completing the IAF answer all compliance related questions accurately to ensure that embedded technological controls in the IAF system function appropriately. In the event OSP or the University Export Compliance Office determines that any answers to the export control questions in any IAF submission are incorrect, OSP or the UECO may require correction of the IAF by the appropriate person(s).\nIn addition to the IAF, OSP may deem it necessary to contact faculty or staff to request additional information or to require the completion of additional forms. It is the responsibility of faculty and\/or staff to promptly and accurately provide such additional information and\/or to complete any and all forms requested by OSP in order to enable an effective Export Review. Failure to timely respond to requests for information and\/or to provide necessary documentation to enable completion of any export review may delay submission of proposals and\/or acceptance of awards.\nNon-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), Data Use Agreements (DUA), Memorandums of Understanding, and other non-financial agreements (non-IAF reviews)\nNot all documents and transactions reviewed and processed by OSP are initiated through the IAF system. As part of OSP\u2019s review of such documents and transactions, certain information, documentation or forms may be required in order for OSP to perform a review to determine whether or not a particular agreement or transaction will be impacted by U.S. export laws, regulations and guidelines.\nOSP may deem it necessary to contact faculty or staff to request additional information or documentation or to require the completion of additional forms. It is the responsibility of faculty and\/or staff to promptly and accurately complete any and all forms provided by OSP in order to complete an effective Export Review.\nRestricted\/Controlled Projects\nIn the event that a particular sponsored research project does not meet the definition of Fundamental Research (making the project a \u201cControlled Project\u201d), certain procedures must be followed to mitigate the export compliance risks from acceptance of a Controlled Project and to document the University\u2019s compliance with U.S. export laws, regulations and guidelines. These procedures may include, but are not limited to, the implementation of a Technology Control Plan (TCP) or other internal security provisions, completion of Online Export Compliance Training, attendance of a Security Meeting, as well as activities related to the ongoing review and monitoring of the Controlled Project. It is the responsibility of Principal Investigator for any Controlled Projects to promptly and accurately provide any additional information and\/or to complete any and all forms requested by OSP in order to enable the development of any necessary internal security procedures. Failure to timely respond to requests for information and\/or to provide necessary documentation to enable timely completion of such mitigation efforts may delay the final acceptance of the grant, contract or award.\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for the operation of their projects in conformity with any such established security procedures.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this Guideline, please contact the Office of Sponsored Programs at export-osp@psu.edu.

The guiding ethical principles are embodied in the Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research.Compliance with this policy provides protections for human participants as mandated by applicable laws, regulations, and standards of local, state and Federal government agencies concerning the protection of human participants, including the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR):\nTitle 45 CFR 46, Protection of Human Subjects, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS), Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) \u00a0and\nTitle 21 CFR 50, 56, 312, 600 and 812 of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u00a0\nThe University's policy for the protection of human participants also meets high institutional standards in its ethical principles and regulations. Institutional requirements are mandated for all research, not just federally-funded research.\nThe Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a specifically constituted administrative review board established for the purpose of protecting the rights and welfare of human participants who are recruited to participate in research. The jurisdiction of the IRB relates to the institution with which it is affiliated.\nAn Assurance is kept on file with the Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) covering all University colleges and campus locations, with the exception of the College of Medicine (COM), which maintains a separate Assurance with OHRP. The Pennsylvania College of Technology is excepted from both of these assurances. These Assurances set forth the policies for the protection of human participants, and include the duties and procedures of the IRBs.\nUniversity-related research, as defined by 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR, 50, 56, 312, 600, and 812, involving human participants directly or through the use of records, tissues, or other indirect means must receive prior review and approval before any project can begin. Research involving human participants may not be conducted within or on behalf of the University without prior review and approval of the project prior to involving human participants.\nThus, the IRB is the final authority for safeguarding, as defined by 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR, 50, 56, 312, 600, and 812, research involving human participants. Failure to have research involving human participants reviewed and approved by the IRB is a violation of University policy, Federal regulations, and the Assurance. In addition to review by the IRB, research may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by the officials of the institution; however, those officials may not override a decision by the IRB to disapprove research.\nDEFINITIONS:\nThis policy defines \u201chuman research\u201d or \u201cresearch involving human participants\u201d as any activity that meets the DHHS definition of \u201cresearch\u201d which involves persons who meet the DHHS definition of \u201chuman participant,\u201d OR any activity that meets the FDA definition of \u201cresearch\u201d which involves persons who meet the FDA definition of \u201chuman participant.\u201d\n\u201cResearch\u201d under the DHHS regulations means a \u201csystematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge\u201d (45 CFR \u00a746.102[d]).\n\u201cHuman participant\u201d or \"Human subject\" under the DHHS regulations means a \u201cliving individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains: (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual or (2) identifiable private information\u201d (45 CFR \u00a746.102[f])) . Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the participant or the participant\u2019s environment that are performed for research purposes. Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and participant. Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonable expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonable expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individual identifiable (i.e., the identity of the participant is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human participants.\n\u201cResearch\u201d under the FDA regulations means any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human participants and that either is subject to requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration under section 505(i) or 520(g) of the act, or is not subject to requirements for prior submission to the FDA under these sections of the act, but the results of which are intended to be submitted later to, or held for inspection by the FDA as part of an application for a research or marketing permit. The terms research, clinical research, clinical study, study and clinical investigation are deemed synonymous for purposes of the FDA regulations (21 CFR \u00a756.102[c]). In practice, all uses of drugs or medical devices constitute \u201cresearch\u201d under this definition unless the drug or device is both approved and being used in the course of medical practices. In addition, all uses of FDA-regulated test articles in which the results will be submitted to the FDA or held for inspection by the FDA constitute \u201cresearch\u201d under this definition.\n\u201cHuman participant\u201d or \"Human subject\" under the FDA regulations means an individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as a recipient of a test article or as a control. For medical device studies in which data will be submitted to the FDA or held for inspection by the FDA, a human participant includes a human on whose specimen an investigational device is used.\n\u201cMinimal risk\u201d means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests (45 CFR \u00a746.102[i]).\n\u201cResearch Agreement\u201d is defined as the mutually binding legal document between the funding entity and the University specifying the terms and obligations under which the externally-funded project services will be conducted.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nResearch conducted at the University includes both biomedical research and social science research. Due to the large volume and diverse nature of research conducted at the University, multiple IRBs have been established in order to provide the review and oversight for all research involving human participants. The committee members are appointed by the Associate Vice President for Research (located at University Park campus) or the Vice Dean for Research and Graduate Studies, Penn State COM (located at COM) to recommend and implement policies and regulations for the protection of human participants in research.\nThe University has established two IRBs located at the University Park Campus. These IRBs review all of the research conducted by investigators from all University colleges and campus locations except the COM and the Pennsylvania College of Technology.\nPenn State's College of Medicine located at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center (PSHMC) has established four IRBs to review and provide oversight for biomedical and social science research projects conducted at the COM and PSHMC, the University Park Regional Campus, and the Penn State Hershey Medical Group locations. PSHMC has a separate Assurance with OHRP and has designated the COM IRBs for the review of research under this Assurance. PSHMC has a written agreement with the COM documenting this reliance on the COM IRBs.\nAUTHORITY OF THE IRB:\nThe IRB has the authority to review all human subject research in which the University is engaged (HRP-311 Engagement Determination), regardless of funding or research site, including the categories exempted or waived by OHRP or FDA regulations.\nThe IRB has the authority to:\nApprove, require modification to secure approval, disapprove all research activities overseen and conducted by the organization;\nSuspend or terminate IRB approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with IRB requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to participants;\nObserve, or have a third party observe, the consent process; and\nObserve, or have a third party observe, the conduct of the research.\nThe IRB will review and approve research conducted outside the United States of America by the University or PSHMC employees or students even if the foreign research receives no U.S. government funding. Such collaborative research activities must meet high ethical standards similar to those required within this policy. The IRB may approve such research, provided it determines that (a) the research conforms to proper codes of ethics (e.g., the Declaration of Helsinki or the Belmont Report), and (b) the research is approved by the foreign research site's ethical review authority. Requirements for the informed consent process will follow the laws and customs of the country in which the research is being conducted. If a U.S. Department or Agency funds the research, then it is probable that the foreign research site will need to file an FWA application. Instructions and templates for foreign research are available from OHRP (Assurances and IRB Registration).\nTYPES OF IRB REVIEW:\nThree levels of IRB review\/approval for research involving human participants have been established: (1) Committee Review, (2) Expedited Review, and (3) Exempt Review. Each type of review is specifically defined in the Federal regulations. The University IRBs must follow these specifications for designating the review type to remain in compliance with the Assurances.\nCommittee Review - All projects involving human participants exposed to greater than minimal risks (including all research that exposes the participant to x-rays and\/or microwaves) must be submitted for review by the IRB at a convened meeting. Such projects require submission of the application, a protocol, informed consent\/assent form(s) (if applicable), and supporting documents (e.g., recruitment material, questionnaires, surveys, investigator brochures, and grant proposals [if applicable]).\nFollowing initial review and approval by the IRB at a convened meeting, investigators conducting research designated by the IRB as Committee Review are required to do the following:\nhave all modifications to the research protocol reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to instituting them;\nreport to the IRB problems that require prompt reporting (see HRP-024 \u2013 SOP- New Information, , HRP-001 \u2013 Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 Definitions, HRP-103 \u2013 Investigator Manual, Appendix A-1);\nmaintain IRB approval until data collection and analysis is complete and all research activity has ceased;\nsubmit reports\/information to the IRB as requested; and\nsubmit progress reports at intervals stipulated by the IRB.\nExpedited Review - All projects involving human participants exposed to no more than minimal risk, as defined above, or to no risk (e.g., existing record review, use of existing pathology, surveys) and that are included on the list of types of research designated by Federal regulations as qualifying for expedited review may be approved through the expedited review process (45 CFR 46.110). Such projects do not have to wait for a convened meeting of the full IRB, but may be reviewed and approved by the IRB chair or his\/her designee, and reported to the IRB at a convened meeting. These projects require submission of the application, a protocol, informed consent\/assent form(s) (if applicable), and supporting documents (e.g., recruitment material, questionnaires, surveys, and grant proposals [if applicable]).\nFollowing initial review and approval by the IRB Chair or Chair's designee, investigators conducting research designated by the IRB as qualified for expedited review are required to do the following:\nhave all modifications to the research protocol reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to instituting them;\nreport to the IRB problems that require prompt reporting (see HRP-024- Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 New Information, HRP-001 \u2013 Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 Definitions, HRP-103 \u2013 Investigator Manual, Appendix A-1);\nmaintain IRB approval until data collection and analysis has been completed, and all research activity has ceased;\nsubmit reports\/information to the IRB as requested; and\nsubmit progress reports at intervals stipulated by the IRB.\nExempt Research - Certain types of research may be found by the IRB to be exempt from IRB oversight (45 CFR 46.101[b]). At the University, investigators may not make an independent determination that research involving human participants is exempt from Federal regulations. Only a designated IRB member or qualified staff from the Office for Research Protections or Human Subjects Protection Office has the authority to make this determination following review of an application, a protocol, informed consent form(s), if applicable, and supporting documents (e.g., recruitment materials, questionnaires\/surveys, and grant proposals, [if applicable]). For information on modifications that are required to be submitted at the exempt level, refer to HRP-103 \u2013 Investigator Manual.\nActivities that do not meet the definition of human subject research do not require review and approval by one of the Organization\u2019s IRBs and do not need to be submitted to one of the Organization\u2019s IRBs unless there is a question regarding whether the activity is human subject research.\u00a0 Any questions about whether an activity meets the regulatory definitions of human subject research should be referred to the IRB Office who will provide a determination.\nOTHER INSTITUTIONS: \nThe IRB interacts with other institutions to ensure that IRB policies and procedures are followed when the University or PSHMC employees and students perform research at other institutions, or when personnel or students from other institutions perform research at the University or PSHMC facilities.\nThe IRB may agree to permit another federally sanctioned IRB to serve as the IRB of record for studies to be conducted by, or with the assistance of University personnel, at the facilities of a second institution. The IRB may agree to function as the IRB of record for another investigator and\/or institution if the project involves material collaboration from University personnel. Such agreements will require written letters of agreement and may include the completion of additional documentation under the Federal-wide Assurance process. Copies of these agreements will be maintained at the respective administrative area.\nREGULATORY AGENCIES:\nAs required by Federal regulations and by the Assurances, the IRB will contact directly the appropriate governmental authority at OHRP and\/or FDA regarding questions or to notify them of reportable events, such as unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others, serious or continuing investigator non-compliance, or termination or suspension of IRB approval of research rotocols.\nRESEARCH AGREEMENT, FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST:\nThe research agreement and financial information related to sponsored research, such as project budget, schedule of payments to the University and human participants, arrangements for medical care for research-related injury, and monetary payments, if offered, must be submitted to the Office of Sponsored Programs at the University Park Campus or the Office of Research Affairs at College of Medicine for review (see RA16 - this policy does not exist). If, as the project progresses, there are changes in financial arrangements, these new arrangements must be submitted to the Office of Sponsored Programs or the Office of Research Affairs for review and approval prior to instituting these changes. For federally funded projects, see\u00a0RA04 - Making Revisions to Budgets and Program Plans on Federally Sponsored Projects. It is the policy of the University that neither it, nor its investigators, or other study personnel, will accept unauthorized incentives or bonuses tied to the rate of recruitment of project participants or to early enrollment of participants in clinical trials, whether such incentives or bonuses are offered as a part of a research agreement or at any other time. For the purposes of this policy, the terms, incentives, or bonuses include anything of value.\nIn accordance with University Policy\u00a0RP06\u00a0-\u00a0Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests (formerly Policy RA20), all investigators (as defined in RP06) must apprise the IRB of any significant financial interest. The term \"Significant Financial Interest\" and financial disclosure thresholds and other policy requirements are detailed and defined in Policy RP06. Additional requirements for researchers at Penn State Hershey campus can be located on the Penn State Hershey Conflict of Interest office website. Final IRB approval for any project will be withheld pending disclosure, management and\/or resolution of any conflict-of-interest issues to the satisfaction of the IRB.\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES: \nThe Principal Investigator (PI) is the individual responsible for the implementation of research. The IRB recognizes one PI for each project. All official IRB correspondence is addressed to the PI. Co-investigators communicate with the IRB through the PI. The PI has the ultimate responsibility for his\/her research project by:\nAcknowledging and accepting his\/her responsibility for protecting the rights and welfare of human research participants and for complying with all applicable Federal, state, and local regulations, as well as University policies regarding research with human participants;\nEnsuring that a project is designed to minimize risks to participants while maximizing research benefits;\nEnsuring that all members of the research team know and understand the research project and they comply with the findings, determinations, and requirements of the IRB;\nEnsuring the adequacy of both the informed consent form and the informed consent process;\nEnsuring that all human participant research that he\/she conducts receives initial prospective review and approval by the IRB;\nEnsuring that continuing review and approval of the research has been accomplished within the time frame stipulated by the IRB;\nEnsuring that no changes in approved research are initiated without prior IRB review and approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to participants;\nEnsuring that no research is continued beyond the IRB designated approval period;\nNotifying the IRB promptly of:\nAny significant problems that require prompt reporting to the IRB according to HRP-024 \u2013 Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 New Information, HRP-001 \u2013 Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 Definitions, HRP-103 \u2013 Investigator Manual, Appendix A-1)\u201d and;\nAny suspected non-compliance as described in HRP-024 \u2013 Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 New Information, HRP-001 \u2013 Standard Operating Procedure:\u00a0 Definitions, HRP-103 \u2013 Investigator Manual, Appendix A-1); with applicable regulatory requirements or determinations of the IRB of which he\/she becomes aware.\n\nFor additional information, contact:\nOffice for Research Protections\n\tPenn State University\n\t205 The 330 Building\n\tInnovation Park\n\tUniversity Park, PA 16802\n\t(814) 865-1775\nor\nHuman Subjects Protection Office\n\tPenn State University COM\n\t90 Hope Drive, P.O.

Contributions may be made through direct giving or payroll deduction. Payroll deductions for an authorized campaign will be over a twelve-month period or less beginning in January, with the authorized fund-raising agency being designated no later than September of the preceding year.\nThe President will officially recognize and endorse the fund-raising campaign.\nThe use of campus mail service is permitted for the distribution of informational and campaign material.\nThe volunteer campus fund chairperson will be appointed by the President for the University Park campus and by the Campus Executive Officer or Dean at each of the other locations. The campus fund chairperson and others who assist shall be considered as citizens of the local community volunteering their participation in the campaign and also acting on behalf of the University as a major employer in the community served by each campus. Expenses for University employees, who are serving as University representatives to the main campaign steering committee for the community charitable organization, to attend kick-off or final celebration events may be paid from general funds.\nThe local chairpersons may conduct meetings or in other ways communicate with employees concerning the fund drive. Any meetings shall be attended on a voluntary basis and will be scheduled so as to provide minimum interference with the performance of the employee's duties. Any costs incurred for these meetings, including group-meeting expenses, may only be paid from non-research unrestricted miscellaneous funds.\nConfidentiality of each employee's participation will be preserved and employee participation will be strictly voluntary.\nThe University will bear incidental internal costs of conducting the authorized fund-raising campaign. These costs will be managed and accounted for by the Office of University Relations.\nOTHER ACTIVITIES:\nThe University encourages administrative units and departments that wish to sponsor activities or events that raise additional funds for the authorized charitable agency to do so within the guidelines outlined below. However, sponsorship and\/or support may not come from University funds, unless specifically outlined below:\nCASH HANDLING:\nProceeds from events\/activities outlined below must be separate from any University funds, and may not be deposited into a University account. Administrative units and departments wishing to raise additional funds must take the appropriate steps to make sure that the cash is being safeguarded in a safe or other secure location, segregated from other University funds (i.e. In a locked bag\/box within a University safe is permitted). In addition, the individuals transferring the funds to the authorized charity should document the transfer of funds via a signed log or other means that indicate the transfer has taken place and at what amount.\nAUXILIARY SERVICE PARTICIPATION IN FUND-RAISING EVENTS:\nAuxiliary Services are only permitted to provide complimentary meals or services as part of a marketing or promotion effort. If an auxiliary unit participates in an event in support of the authorized charity, the related expenses must be charged to a marketing\/promotional line in the budget or cost center. These are the only University units authorized to provide complementary meals or services.\nMARKETING\/PUBLICATION COSTS:\nAll costs related to marketing or publicizing events in support of the authorized charity, other than those sponsored by the Office of Strategic Communications, may not be paid from any University funds. In addition, Penn State websites (psu.edu) may not be used to provide detailed order information or transactions for the activity, especially on-line auctions (including listing of auction items). On-line listings promoting activities and events for the approved charity to employees are permissible, as well as volunteer sign-up sites (such as for day of caring).\nFollowing are specific guidelines related to particular types of activities:\nDRAWINGS - Drawings for prizes are permissible if there is no purchase of tickets. Some units provide incentives to return the fund-raising materials by placing the individual's name into a drawing. This is permissible, but the following rules apply:\nPrizes awarded must either be donated or purchased through non-research unrestricted miscellaneous funds (i.e. OGE). General funds may not be used to purchase the prizes or incentives.\nTickets for Penn State athletic events purchased with University funds may not be used as fund-raising incentives. If an individual donates tickets and there is no cost to the University, then these may be used as incentives for participation.\nAll prizes are taxable to the recipients. See FN10 for more detail on taxability. Cash awards (including gift certificates) must be reported to payroll no matter the dollar amount. Non-cash prizes must be reported to Accounting Operations if they are valued at $100 or more.\nRAFFLES - These are not permitted, even if no University funds are involved. A raffle is different from a drawing in that a ticket must be purchased, while in a drawing, no purchase is necessary.\nSALES - Selling items to support the authorized charity is only permissible if no University funds are used to purchase the goods or items to be sold and the funds received are not deposited to University accounts (see cash handling above). If applicable, sales tax must be collected and remitted.\nFOOD SALES - Sales of food items on University premises falls under the regulations of Policy AD26. Because of ongoing concerns regarding the safe and proper handling of food products, the selling of food to support the authorized charity, as per the guidelines set forth in AD06 and AD26, will be limited to:\nProducts prepared by a commercial or University food service,\nProducts that do not require refrigeration, and\nProducts that are prepackaged for resale\nT-SHIRTS\/GIVEAWAYS - These are permissible to reward participation, but cannot be purchased from University general funds. Non-research unrestricted miscellaneous funds are the only source of funds available to pay for these incentives, although donation of these items from local merchants are also permitted.\nAUCTIONS - Auctions to raise funds for the authorized charity are permitted, but all items being auctioned must be donated for this purpose and no auction items or other costs may be paid for from any University funds. Proceeds from any such events cannot be deposited to University accounts. (See Marketing\/Publication Costs above for restrictions on auctions and Penn State websites.)\nExceptions to the above guidelines must be approved by the Vice President for University Relations in consultation with the Senior Vice President for Finance & Business.\nLIMITATIONS:\nDirect charitable contributions or donations from General Funds of the University for any purpose are not permitted. (See also Policy FN10.) In certain instances, however, it may be in the best interests of the University to make donations directly to select charitable organizations or to be represented at non-University charitable fund-raising events. Reimbursement for direct donations or expenses incurred in attending such events will be treated as an exception (although General Funds are not to be used as the source for reimbursement). The request for reimbursement must be submitted to the budget executive of the administrative unit, accompanied by a written justification which indicates that such direct donations or attendance is of significant benefit to the University and its off-campus relations.\nUnder no circumstances may contributions or donations be made, directly or indirectly, to a political party, a political candidate or an elected official from any funds received and\/or administered by the University, regardless of the source of such funds.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Strategic Communications.\nMost recent changes:\nAugust 21, 2014 - Editorial changes.

If a vendor sends an invoice with the material directly to the department concerned, that department must forward the invoice immediately to Purchasing Services.\nIn order to expedite vendor invoice payments in time to capitalize on all discounts available, the University will process those invoices under $5,000 (except for payments to consultants - see Policy BS17 - and invoices resulting in payment to a foreign country), as follows:\nIf the invoice amount is less than $5,000 (excluding discounts and freight) and, after notification to the ordering department, Purchasing Services has not received notification otherwise, the invoice will be processed for payment through Accounting Operations in time to take advantage of any discounts available. The invoice will be charged to the ordering department's budget according to data on the Purchase Order. (See Procedure #PC2007 for further details.)\nFor orders originating at locations other than University Park, vendors are directed to submit their invoices to Purchasing Services for entry in the eBuy+ System. Upon receiving the material ordered, that location will confirm the invoice for payment through the eBuy+ Invoice Confirmation System.\nFor processing invoices pertaining to Limited Orders, see Policy BS16.\nPROCESSING INVOICES FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES:\nInvoices received which require payment in a foreign currency are to be handled differently. All foreign currency invoices must be confirmed in the eBuy+ Invoice Confirmation System regardless of the dollar amount.

Payments should be made as indicated below, even if the research participant is currently a Penn State employee. In other words, employee determination does not need to be made \u2013 all research participants will be paid by the methods below.\nPAYMENT BY SRFC:\nGenerally, payments to research participants must be paid by Special Request for Check (SRFC), using object code 0394 and a purpose of 1099 AWARDS. (See Cash or Gift Card Payments, below, for specific situation where an SRFC is not required.) The following are required from each participant:\nSocial Security Number, PSU ID, or individual tax identification number (SSNs\/IDs)\nNon-Employee Information (NEI) Form and supporting documents\nThis information should be collected from the individuals to be paid at the time the study is conducted. Multiple individuals can be paid through a single SRFC. The payment will be made from the account number of the research project.\nIf a participant is not eligible for payment based on the information provided in the NEI form, then payment cannot be made through a SRFC. Thus, participant cannot be used in the study unless qualifying for a Cash or Gift Card Payment, below.\nConfidentiality: If due to the nature of the research, payment to participants through the research project account would breach confidentiality, as determined by the Principal Investigator, then payments can\/will be paid through a Miscellaneous General Research (MGR) account. In a separate process a Journal Voucher would be used to transfer the total payment amount \u2013 not identifying individuals \u2013 to the research account indicating that the payments were for confidential research and names and SSNs\/IDs are on file in the department.\nCASH OR GIFT CARD PAYMENTS\nCash or gift cards may be given to research participants in the following limited situations. There is no requirement to collect SSNs\/IDs or the NEI form with cash or gift card payments.\nPayments of $100 or less:\nPayments of $100 or less (where the aggregate payments to participant for the particular study is $300 or less in a calendar year) may be made by issuing cash or gift cards to participants.\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) must keep payment records which include name, amount, date and signature of the participant confirming receipt of the cash or gift card. This record is then used to settle the cash advance or gift card purchase. The PI must also account for unused cash or gift cards and maintain cash\/gift cards in a secure location.\nCash payments are issued as a cash advance to the PI using the Special Request for Check, using object code 0411 and CEN-USE. The IRB Study number should be included in the notepad. The cash must be maintained in a secure location until payments are made to participants. Settlement of advances should be done as soon as possible after the participant segment is completed, but no later than 30 days prior to the end date of the award.\nGift cards can be obtained through eBuy through approved vendor National Gift Card (NGC), with options for either physical cards or eCode. (NGC information available in SUPPLIER INFORMATION section on Purchasing web site). The IRB Study number should be noted in eBuy. Gift cards and eCodes must be maintained in a secure location until distributed to participants. Settlement of the gift card purchase must be made as soon as possible after the participant segment is completed, but no later than 30 days prior to the end date of the award.\nPurchase of gift cards other than through eBuy require approval of the Financial Officer. The Purchasing Card may be used. The IRB Study number must be noted in the payment documentation (PCard Support form, SRFC notepad, or PO comment).\nAnonymous Questionnaires or Surveys:\nA PI may wish to include small dollar stipends (maximum $10) with an anonymous questionnaire or survey as an incentive to the recipient to complete and return the questionnaire or survey. The PI must indicate the number of questionnaires to be mailed and the amount to be placed in each envelope in a memo or email to be approved by the budget administrator. This memo or email becomes part of the back-up for the SRFC when the cash advance is requested. The Financial Officer also must review control procedures to assure that the cash is properly safeguarded and controlled. In general, a minimum of two people must be involved when putting the funds into the envelopes and then preparing the questionnaires\/surveys for mailing.\nCompelling Reason for Cash Payments Greater than $100:\nThere are situations where a SRFC cannot meet the University\u2019s research objectives (e.g., when payments to participants must remain anonymous to all but the PI). In such situations, the University acknowledges that there is a compelling reason to permit cash payments greater than $100. There is potential financial liability for the PI and the area which approves the exception if proper payment records are not maintained, or if the IRS challenges the taxability of such payments.\nTo obtain this exception, a Research Participant Cash Payment Exception MUST be completed by the PI, and approved by both the budget administrator & University Tax Director. Once approved, this form must be attached to the SRFC requesting the cash advance for the PI, and must include the IRB Study number. All other requirements regarding settlement apply.\nSponsor Provided Payments:\nThe University prefers that all payments issued to participants follow the above guidelines. However, if a sponsor wishes to use an outside entity to issue payments to participants, then it will be the responsibility of the sponsor to manage the 1099 reporting to the IRS. Payment would be issued in the name of the sponsor, not the University. Gift cards provided by sponsors are permitted, but must be for $100 or less. Gift cards of a higher amount would require that the sponsor be listed as the payee responsible for all 1099 reporting.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nADG08 - Collection, Storage and Authorized Use of Social Security Numbers and Penn State Identification Numbers (Replaced Policy AD19)\nAD47 - General Standards of Professional Ethics\nAD83 - Institutional Financial Conflict of Interest\nRP03 - The Use of Human Participants in Research\nRP05 - Research Quality in Human Participant Research\nRP07 - HIPAA and Research at Penn State University\nRP08 - HIPAA and Research at The Milton S.

Laser radiation may be emitted as a continuous wave or as pulses.\nLASER Hazard Classifications -- Lasers are classified in terms of their potential to cause biological damage. The pertinent parameters are: laser output energy or power, radiation wavelengths, exposure duration, and cross sectional area of the laser beam at the point of interest. The hazard classification of a laser, or laser system is determined as per American National Standards for the Safe Use of Lasers, Z136.1, Section 3.\nLaser Safety Officer (LSO) -- One who has authority to monitor and enforce the control of laser hazards and effect the knowledgeable evaluation and control of laser hazards.\nSupervisor -- The individual responsible for a laser.\nUser -- An individual engaged in work with a laser.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy applies to Class 3b lasers, Class 4 lasers, and Class 1 laser systems with embedded Class 3b or Class 4 lasers.\nPOLICY:\nSupervisors and users of lasers are only permitted to install, operate, transfer or dispose of these devices if they comply with the requirements of this policy.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nEnvironmental Health and Safety:\nEnvironmental Health and Safety (EHS) is responsible for the oversight, implementation, coordination, and enforcement of the laser safety program for Penn State University. EHS will maintain an inventory of University owned or operated laser systems, will provide assistance in evaluating laser hazards, will evaluate lasers for conformance to these rules, will provide fundamental laser safety training, will provide oversight and guidance in the safe use of lasers, will conduct random audits of supervisor inspections of lasers, and will assist in accident investigations involving lasers.\nEHS has the authority and duty to remove from service any laser system which poses an immediate danger to personnel.\nEHS will appoint an appropriately trained staff member to be the University Laser Safety Officer.\nSupervisors:\nSupervisors are responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of the lasers under their control, adhering to the requirements of this policy, immediately informing EHS of the acquisition, modification, transfer, or disposal of systems, developing written operating procedures for each laser system, providing training on those procedures to respective users, completing the fundamental laser safety training provided by EHS, ensuring that users of their laser have also completed the training, classifying and labeling all of their lasers, providing and assuring that all appropriate laser safety equipment is used, following-up on reports of unsafe conditions, ensuring work with the laser is suspended until the unsafe conditions are rectified, and completing and documenting the required inspections, that include but not limited to, laser specific information, administrative controls, and engineering controls.\nUsers:\nUsers of lasers are required to complete the laser safety training provided by EHS before beginning work with lasers, to follow written operating procedures, to perform all work in a safe manner and use approved personal protective equipment. Users are also responsible for reporting to the supervisor any unusual or unsafe condition they discover with the laser, and for suspending work with that laser until the unsafe condition is rectified. The user is responsible for immediately informing the supervisor in the event of any exposure to the laser.\nOPERATIONS:\nAll laser systems and applications shall have a hazard evaluation and be classified in accordance with ANSI Z136.1. This is to be documented on the EHS laser hazard evaluation and classification form. Warning signs and labels along with personnel protective equipment must be selected based on the classification and hazard evaluation. Controls and training are in accordance with ANSI Z136.1. All non-beam hazards shall be identified on the hazard evaluation and classification form. EHS and the Laser Supervisor must establish administrative and engineering controls based on the classification of the laser and hazard evaluation. All lasers shall be inspected annually and the inspection documented on EHS laser inspection form. Special requirements exist for public display lasers and outdoor operation lasers (i.e. laser tag, laser light shows etc.). Contact EHS for information regarding such laser use.\nACQUISITION, RELOCATION, TRANSFER, AND DISPOSAL OF EQUIPMENT:\nSupervisors are strongly encouraged to consult with EHS as early as possible prior to ordering or installing any laser equipment. EHS can provide useful information concerning appropriate safety features, suitability of installation location and the safe operation of the equipment. All lasers owned or operated by PSU are required to be registered with EHS. This includes, but is not limited to, any instrument maintained in storage or donated to the University.\nOnce installed, the supervisor shall complete the registration form and the inspection form and forward them to EHS. This also applies to relocation of current systems to another location. The system shall not be put into routine service and operation until the inspection form is completed.\nTransferring a device to another supervisor within the University requires a safety evaluation at the new location and the new supervisor's laser safety training status. Lasers being transferred, donated, or sold to another institution, company, or individual, requires prior notification to EHS.Supervisors shall also inform EHS when a system is permanently removed from service and is to be either disposed of or used for parts.\nDisposal of laser equipment through Lion Surplus must take into account the proper disposal of all hazardous substances. Dyes, oils, and other hazardous components must be removed and disposed of in accordance with the Hazardous Waste Disposal Policy (SY20) before taking it to Lion Surplus.Contact EHS for guidance on proper disposal.\nTRAINING:\nSupervisors and users of lasers shall complete the fundamental laser safety training class offered by EHS prior to beginning work with any lasers.The training will consist of the following general topics: Laser Fundamentals, Laser Hazards, Non-beam Hazards, Laser Accidents, Control Measures, and Elements of PSU's Laser Safety Program.\nThe supervisor shall provide training to users in the operating and safety procedures of individual laser systems.\nFACILITY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\nLocation and applications of lasers shall be limited to areas that ensure the safety of users and non-users. The facility design or location shall be such as to reduce exposure to laser radiation to non-hazardous levels and control exposure to non-beam hazards. This includes but is not limited to: beam height, beam stops, appropriate surfaces, and barrier curtains.\nMEDICAL SURVEILLANCE:\nPre-use: A pre-use medical evaluation may be conducted on laser users based on a risk assessment.\nPost Incident: Exposure to the primary beam of a laser may result in serious injury. If a situation arises where an individual is accidentally exposed to the primary beam of a laser, or if you suspect that an individual has been exposed, the following action is to be taken immediately:\nShut off the laser and its electrical power source and secure it from use by other individuals. Do not change the experimental or equipment configuration. Exposure determination and corrective actions can best be evaluated if the system set-up is not altered in any way following the event.\nIf this is a life-threatening emergency such as electrical shock, fire,etc., dial 911 for emergency response. Contact EHS at 814-865-6391. Inform them that you need to contact the Laser Safety Officer immediately. Inform the supervisor of the system of the accident.\nFor non- life-threatening emergencies notify your supervisor and EHS.The appropriate medical attention should be sought if the person exposed to the hazard, supervisor, or EHS feels it is warranted.\nIn conjunction with the individual involved, system supervisor, and respective department safety officer, EHS will begin an investigation as to the circumstances of the event. The system in question shall remain out of service pending the results of the investigation and completion of any corrective actions, if needed. The system may only be returned to service following approval by EHS Laser Safety Officer or designee.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nSY01 - Environmental Health and Safety Policy\nSY04 - Employee Accidents - Reporting and Investigation\nSY20 - Hazardous Waste Disposal\nEffective Date: January 17, 2005\n\tDate Approved: November 16,2005\n\tDate Published: January 14, 2005 (Editorial changes, June 12, 2014)\nMost recent changes:\nJune 12, 2014 - Editorial changes.

As long as the use of this name is not intended for the purposes of avoiding legal obligations or for misrepresentation, the University acknowledges that a \u201cpreferred name\u201d can be used where possible in the course of University business and education.\nOnly the first name may be designated to appear as a preferred name, in systems which can accommodate it. The person\u2019s preferred name may be used in University communications and informational materials except where the use of the legal name is required by University business or legal need. Not all University information systems, databases, and processes may be able to display a preferred name, and many uses require display of the legal name; therefore, individuals who utilize a preferred name within University systems should always be prepared to reference their legal name and provide corresponding identification when necessary.\nThe University reserves the right to refuse a preferred name. Instances that may result in this prohibition include arbitrary or repeated name changes; the use of profane words; names that may be used for fraudulent purposes; or other situations deemed appropriate.\nExcept as set forth below, the individual is free to determine the preferred name he or she wants to be known by in University information systems. Only the first name may be designated for the preferred name; the last name must remain the same as the full legal last name in the system.\nThe following list provides examples of appropriate preferred name options at this time:\nA shortened version of the full legal name may be used (for example, Christine to \u201cChris\u201d).\nInitials may be used (David Craig to \u201cD. C.\u201d; Mary Ann to \u201c M.A.\u201d; Teresa Jeanette to \u201cT.J.\u201d).\nA different first name than the legal first name may be used (David Craig to \u201cChristy\u201d; Christine to \u201cCory\u201d; Crystal Lynn to \u201cLynn\u201d).\nIn the instances where a member of the University community utilizes a preferred name in various University information systems, it should be understood that for University business, it will still be necessary that the legal name be used wherever the legal name is required by University business or legal need. This may, but is not limited to, include financial, medical, and law enforcement documents, transcripts, diplomas, W-4 forms, I-9 forms, payroll documents, Visa\/immigration documents, personnel files, employment applications and related documents, background check documents, and insurance documents.\nGender Identity:\nThe Pennsylvania State University recognizes the need or preference for members of the University community to self-assert a Gender other than their Legal Gender or their Gender at the time of birth (sometimes called \u201cBirth Gender). As long as the use of this Gender assertion is not intended for the purposes of avoiding legal obligations or for misrepresentation, the University acknowledges that a \u201cGender Identity\u201d can be used where possible in the course of University business and education.\nThe person\u2019s Gender Identity may be used in University communications and informational materials except where the use of the legal Gender is required by University business or legal need. Not all University information systems, databases, and processes may be able to store or display a separate Gender Identity, and there may be uses that require display of the legal Gender; therefore, individuals who utilize a Gender Identity within University systems should always be prepared to reference their legal Gender as well and to provide corresponding identification when necessary.\nExcept as set forth below, the individual is free to determine the Gender Identity they want to be known by in University information systems. The following is the list of Gender Identity options available at this time:\nMan\nWoman\nOther\nIn the instances where a member of the University community uses a Gender Identity in various University information systems, it should be understood that for University business, it will still be necessary that the legal Gender be used wherever the legal Gender is required by University business or legal need. This may include but is not limited to financial, medical, and law enforcement documents, transcripts, diplomas, W-4 forms, I-9 forms, payroll documents, Visa\/immigration documents, personnel files, employment applications and related documents, background check documents, and insurance documents.\nPROCESS:\nIn order to simplify compliance with policies and procedures related to the management of person identity information under Penn State Administrative Policy AD80, Penn State Identity Services (IdS) and the Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) coordinated an initiative to establish the Penn State Person Biographical (Bio) Record. The Person Bio Record is a shared set of data elements related to person identity whose definitions are collectively understood and adhered to, created and maintained under shared policies and procedures.\u200b\nEmployees: Information about procedures related to an employee\u2019s Legal Name, Preferred Name, Gender Designation, or related to withholding directory information, is available through the Penn State Person Biographical (Bio) Record website. A preferred name designation is not a legal name change. If an employee\u2019s name has been legally changed, Policy\u00a0HR66,\u00a0Change of Legal Name of an Employee, applies. Members of the Penn State Employee community requesting use of a preferred name for reasons related to gender transition, or those who have a safety concern should contact the Affirmative Action Office, which will provide liaison to relevant information systems offices when needed.\nStudents: Information about procedures related to a student\u2019s Legal Name, Preferred Name, Gender Designation, or related to withholding directory information, is available through the Penn State Person Biographical (Bio) Record website. Members of the Penn State Student community requesting use of a preferred name for reasons related to gender transition, or those who have a safety concern should contact the LGBTQA Student Resource Center or the Center for Women Students, who will provide liaison to the relevant information system offices when needed.\nAlumni: Alumni Association members may update their personal information through the \u201cUpdate Your Info\u201d link on the Alumni Association website, by email, or by phone. Detailed information may be found at the\u00a0Alumni Association website.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact Identity Services. In addition, students may contact the LGBTQA Student Resource Center or the Center for Women Students; faculty or staff may contact the Office of Affirmative Action.\nMost recent changes:\nApril 5, 2017 - Major changes have been made throughout the entire policy. Verbiage added to provide guidance regarding gender identity within the University's information systems.

A condensed version of Subpart E is included in this guideline as Attachment A as it applies to general fund accounts that are included in the indirect cost pool.\u00a0 For direct costs, refer to the Uniform Guidance and the sponsored award terms.\nUNALLOWABLE COSTS:\nFinancial Officers should independently consult the Uniform Guidance, Subpart E, Cost Principles, to obtain clarification or better understanding of unallowable cost provisions. If it is unclear if an expenditure is unallowable, a conservative approach should be followed and the expenditure should be x-coded. Costs associated with an unallowable\/x-coded transaction should also be x-coded. For example, if an alumni dinner is held, the dinner is unallowable. In addition, costs associated with the dinner, such as physical plant set-up charges, would also be unallowable.\nCertain expenses should be excluded based on function, including:\ndevelopment (fundraising)\nmarketing or promotion\nalumni activities\nstudent activities and recruiting\ngovernmental relations (lobbying)\ndiversity & inclusion\nAttachment A\u00a0contains guidance for x-coding Uniform Guidance provisions.\u00a0 If there are questions about a specific item, contact Cost Analysis.\nUNREASONABLE COSTS:\nEven if a cost is considered to be allowable under the Uniform Guidance, 200.404, Reasonable Costs requires that a reasonableness test must also be applied.\u00a0 All expenses should be evaluated for reasonableness and necessity to conduct the business of the institution in a prudent and efficient manner.\u00a0 Any costs that are not considered reasonable should also be excluded using the procedures outlined below.\nACCOUNTS TO BE EXCLUDED:\nIf an entire general funds account should be considered unallowable for indirect cost purposes, the Financial Officer must code the general funds account as unallowable using IBIS function UXCD. This should be done when new general fund accounts are created, or if revisions to the Uniform Guidance change the allowability of a particular account. A listing of such accounts will be provided to Cost Analysis for review on a periodic basis. If the entire administrative area is excluded for indirect cost purposes, the Financial Officer can code the entire administrative area as being unallowable, if approved by Cost Analysis. Once an account or administrative area is excluded, it will remain so until updated by the Financial Officer, either based on revisions to the Uniform Guidance impacting allowability or if directed to do so by Cost Analysis. There will be no need for annual reporting of excluded accounts.\nOnce the administrative area or account is excluded through UXCD, all transactions will be automatically x-coded (excluded) in IBIS. UXCD may also be used to indicate that this guidelines is not applicable for an administrative area, such as a Commonwealth Campus.\nUNALLOWABLE COSTS WITHIN ALLOWABLE ACCOUNTS:\nIf a specific expenditure within a normally allowable general funds account must be coded as unallowable, the following procedures should be used:\nSalaries: The portion of the salary to be excluded should be x-coded in the Pay and Effort system. If a unit does not use Pay and Effort for salary distribution, then there are two methods for excluding the costs:\nUpdate the actual detail each month for the excluded amount through ICAG.\nTransfer the unallowable salaries to a general funds account that is excluded in total.\nWages: Any wages that should be excluded must be coded by one of the following methods:\nUpdate the actual detail each month for the excluded amount through ICAG.\nTransfer the unallowable wages to a general funds account that is excluded in total.\nDepartmental Allotment: To identify these expenditures as unallowable for facilities and administrative (F&A) cost purposes, the X-code field in the FANS window should be completed with the amount of the transaction to be excluded. If the coding is not done at the time of the transaction, the Financial Officer can update the coding through ICAG, by updating the field in the PF10 window.\nPERIODIC AUDIT:\nAn audit will be conducted periodically to test compliance with procedures for x-coding unallowable costs.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact Cost Analysis, a unit of the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: June 22, 2018\n\tDate Approved: June 21, 2018\n\tDate Published:\u00a0 June 21,2018\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 15, 2017 - Revised to remove IBIS functions being decommissioned as part of the WorkLion implementation process.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nOctober 12, 2016 - Major revisions have been made to this guideline to coincide with changes to the Uniform Guidance (formerly referred to as \"OMB Circular A-21\").\nOctober 3, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Therefore, auxiliary and University service accounts as well as all campus accounts (including those coded as CO at University Park) except Hershey are not subject to this procedure.

Purchases of this nature are made only if it is not practical to obtain the items through the University purchasing procedures. A purchase (or purchases) from a single source that exceeds the $50.00 limit may not be broken up on separate receipts to avoid this limit. The University Purchasing Card should also be used for the convenience of minor purchases. (Refer to Policy\u00a0BS14.)\nBecause of the distance involved from Mailing Services, non-University Park locations may acquire postage stamps from their local Post Offices through the Petty Cash funds or Operating Cash funds, using the Receipt for Petty Cash Expended form. Refer to Procedure BS2008 - University Mailing Services, for information on postage stamps.\nCHANGE FUNDS:\nChange funds are used in cash register operations or other areas where cash collections take place and the need for having change-on-hand exists.\nESTABLISHMENT AND TERM OF A FUND:\nA petty cash, change fund or other advance may be established on a long term or short term basis. Funds established for an indefinite period of time should be recorded as a long term advance.\nFunds may be established in two ways:\nDirect Custodian: As an advance to the petty cash or change fund custodian, who will obtain a temporary or long-term advance directly in their name, by processing a Special Request for Check, with appropriate approval from the custodian\u2019s budget administrator and Financial Officer. The SRFC should credit:\nShort Term (temporary) Advances - Account 0206\nLong Term (permanent) Advances - Account 0207\n\nSub-Custodian: As a Request for Cash Advance through the Financial Officer\u2019s Operating Cash Fund. The custodian of the petty cash or change fund will be treated as a sub-custodian within the Operating Cash Fund.\nCUSTODY OF A FUND:\nThe person to whom the petty cash or change fund is advanced is the custodian of that fund. These funds are non-transferable. Another custodian may be designated by:\nDirect Custody: Notifying the Bursar in writing to change the name of the custodian with approval from the Financial Officer, upon a full reconciliation of the change or petty cash fund signed by both the old and new custodians. Alternatively, the old custodian can close out their advance and the new custodian can open a new advance.\nSub-custodian: Old custodian would close out the Request for Cash Advance and the new custodian would establish a new Request for Cash Advance with the Financial Officer.\nRESTRICTIONS:\nPetty cash and change funds are to be kept intact and never intermingled. Such funds must be kept in separate bags or lockboxes.\u00a0 They are not to be used for cashing employee paychecks or personal checks. Petty cash and change funds are not to be used for making any cash advances.\nSAFEGUARDING CASH:\nIt is the custodian's responsibility to make whatever provisions are necessary to properly safeguard the fund.\nAny amount of cash on hand that exceeds $1,000 must be maintained in a vault or an approved safe (fireproof, bolted to floor or otherwise immovable). Amounts of $1,000 and under must be maintained in a file safe or reinforced file cabinet with a pad lock and bar that secures all drawers. Cash should not be retained in desk drawers or standard file cabinets since they are easily accessed with nominal forcing or readily available keys.\nPETTY CASH EXPENDITURES:\nEach petty cash expenditure must be supported by a Receipt for Petty Cash Expended.\nREIMBURSEMENT OF A PETTY CASH FUND:\nWhenever the cash balance is low in the fund, reimbursement of the exact amount of expenditures should be requested by submitting store \/ cash register receipts to support proof of purchase and completed Receipt for Petty Cash Expended forms, with a Special Request for Check (SRFC).\nINCREASING A FUND:\nDirect Custodian: A Special Request for Check (SRFC) must be processed to increase a fund, with approval by the Financial Officer.\nSub-Custodian: The open Request for Cash Advance must be settled and a new Request for Cash Advance must be processed for the new required total.\nREDUCING A FUND:\nA petty cash or change fund must be reduced when the total amount of the fund exceeds the requirements of the area to which the fund has been issued.\nDirect Custodian: A Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) must be processed debiting the appropriate advance fund, with approval of the Financial Officer, with copy to the Associate Bursar and notation of the name of the custodian in the notepad.\nSub-Custodian: The original request is settled through the Financial Officer and a new Request for Cash Advance is processed for the reduced amount.\nCLOSING A FUND:\nAll petty cash and change funds, whether they have been established for a specific or indefinite period of time, must be returned when they are no longer needed.\nDirect Custodian: A Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) must be processed debiting the appropriate advance fund with approval of the Financial Officer, with copy to the Associate Bursar and notation of the name of the custodian in the notepad.\nSub-Custodian: The original request is settled through the Financial Officer.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nFN05 - Operating Cash Funds\nEffective Date: August 12, 2014\n\tDate Approved: August 12, 2014\u00a0\n\tDate Published: August 12, 2014 (Editorial change, January 18, 2016)\nMost Recent Changes:\nJanuary 18, 2016 - Editorial change to the RESTRICTIONS section clarifying that petty cash and change funds must be kept in separate bags or lock boxes, to bring the policy in sync with Procedure CR2013 (Operating Cash Fund) verbiage.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nAugust 12, 2014 - Major revisions throughout the entire policy to reflect current handling of petty cash and change funds.\nSeptember 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Committee members will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality. Factors that may be used to determine eligibility include the nature of the hardship, the number and nature of previous requests, and income level.\nPROCESS:\nIt is expected that employees requesting assistance from the fund will have sought assistance from other sources external to the University.\nIf there is no other source of funds available, employees may initiate the process by submitting the  application, along with any other written request to: Vice President for Human Resources, The 331 Building, Suite 136, University Park, PA, 16802\u00a0or email assistancefund@psu.edu.\nThe reason for the request, the amount being requested and sufficient documentation to support the request must be provided.\nWith limited funds available, the level of support may be modest in relation to overall need.\nThe University hopes that the establishment of this fund will encourage employees and other members of the Penn State community to make further contributions to help build the endowment. While any payment made to an employee is not treated as a loan and therefore does not need to be paid back, employees, who are interested, are encouraged to contribute to the fund at a later time when their financial situation would permit their doing so.\nTAXIBILITY:\nAs required under the tax law, awards will be treated as University compensation subject to applicable tax withholding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide the criteria under which an employee with exigent financial circumstances can qualify and be eligible to receive payment from the University Employee Assistance Fund to assist with a wide range of personal or family hardships."},{"university":"psu","name":"fn24","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding Educational Services to Military Service Members | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesProviding Educational Services to Military Service Members \n\n\n\nFinancial Policies\n\nFN24\nProviding Educational Services to Military Service Members\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nOffice of the Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nScope\nResponsibilities\nPoint of Contact\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\n\nSCOPE:\nThis policy applies to all University employees providing assistance to military service members.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nTo eliminate aggressive marketing aimed at military service members:\nGifts or other such inducements provided for the purpose of securing enrollments of military service members or obtaining access to tuition assistance funds will NOT be acceptable. This includes any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, transportation, lodging, meals, or other item having a monetary value of more than a de minimus amount.\nOther than normal salaries paid to employees, or normal fees paid to contractors made in conformity with all applicable laws, payments to any individual or entity will NOT be acceptable for the purpose of securing enrollments of military service members or obtaining access to tuition assistance funds.\nUniversity departments will refrain from high-pressure recruitment tactics. Such tactics include making multiple unsolicited phone calls to military service members for the purpose of securing their enrollment.\nThe University will refrain from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting, admission activities. Excess Federal financial aid and\/or tuition assistance funds cannot be offered to entice a military serviceman to enroll at Penn State.\nPOINT OF CONTACT:\nPenn State Outreach (http:\/\/www.worldcampus.psu.edu\/military) shall serve as a point of contact for military service members seeking information about available, appropriate academic counseling, financial aid counseling, and student support services at the University.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nPenn State for Military Students\nScholarships and Aid for Military and Veteran Students\nEffective Date: February 20, 2013\n\tDate Approved: February 20, 2013\n\tDate Published: February 20, 2013 (Editorial changes- September 27, 2013)\nMost Recent Changes:\nSeptember 27, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Policies affecting employees represented by a union are found in the appropriate Agreements.\nCHILD CARE:\n1. GENERAL\nThe FMLA mandates that employees are eligible for up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave in any consecutive 12-month period. University policy, however, provides for additional periods of child care leave. These additional periods are incorporated in sections 2 and 3.\n\t\u00a0\n2. LEAVE FOLLOWING BIRTH OR ADOPTION\nUpon request, a leave shall be granted following the birth of a child of the employee or the employee's partner, to continue up to the time the child is one year of age. In the case of adoption, such leave shall be granted from the date the child begins to reside with the employee to continue up to twelve months, unless necessary earlier for extenuating circumstances as described in the law. The first 12 workweeks of leave shall be considered to comply with the requirements of the FMLA.\nImmediately prior to commencement of the leave, the employee may elect to use or not use all or part of accumulated vacation, personal holiday, service days, or compensatory time off, as applicable, during the leave prior to commencement of no-pay status for the balance of the leave.\nIf the employee requests to continue on leave after the child care leave has expired, such request for additional leave shall be considered on the same basis as any other request for leave for personal reasons, and the conditions applicable to such general personal leaves shall apply. If the additional time is granted, any immediate prior leave time expended for maternity and child care shall be included in calculating the leave-time limit for the new leave in accordance with HR16, Leave of Absence Without Salary.\n\t\u00a0\n3. LEAVE OTHER THAN FOR BIRTH OR ADOPTION\nThe employee requesting a child care leave shall be responsible for providing a satisfactory explanation to support the request for leave.\nFor purposes of this section, the definition of child shall include a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child for which an employee is standing in loco parentis, who is under 18, or over 18 and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.\nUpon request, a leave shall be granted if a child is placed with the employee for foster care (within one year of placement) or if a child has a serious health condition and the employee is needed to care for such child. During the leave, the employee shall first use all sick family days, accumulated vacation, service days, personal holiday, and compensatory time off, as applicable, prior to commencement of no-pay status for the balance of the leave. Such no-pay status shall not exceed three calendar months.\nA leave without pay of up to three calendar months may be granted if there is an extended breakdown in the arrangements for independent child care, and the employee is needed to care for the child. If such leave is granted, the employee shall first use accumulated vacation, unused service days, personal holiday, and compensatory time off, as applicable, prior to commencement of no-pay status for the balance of the leave.\nShort-term absences for child care should be handled by use of sick family days, accumulated vacation, unused service days, compensatory time off, or personal holiday, as applicable, or \"no-pay days\" if paid time off is expended.\nFAMILY ILLNESS (PARTNER OR PARENT):\nUpon request, a leave shall be granted for 12 weeks if the employee's partner or parent has a serious health condition and the employee is needed to care for such family member. During the leave, the employee shall first use all sick family days, accumulated vacation, personal holiday, service days, and compensatory time off, as applicable, prior to commencement of no-pay status for the balance of the leave.\nA serious health condition is one which involves either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. Parent is the biological parent of an employee or an individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child.\nIf, in the 12-month period immediately preceding the requested leave, the employee has been absent without pay for the purposes of child care, family illness, or due to the employee's own illness, such absence shall be included in calculating the three-month-leave-time limit outlined in this section above.\nIf the employee requests to continue on leave without pay after the family illness leave has expired, such request for additional leave shall be considered on the same basis as any other request for leave for personal reasons, and the conditions applicable to such general personal leaves shall apply. If the additional time is granted, any immediate prior leave time shall be included in calculating the leave-time limit for the new leave in accordance with HR16, Leave of Absence Without Salary.\nEMPLOYEE'S OWN SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION:\nThe FMLA mandates that employees are eligible for up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave in any consecutive 12-month period because of an employee's serious health condition. University policy, however, provides for additional periods of sick leave without pay depending upon length of service. This additional time is outlined in HR16, Leave of Absence Without Salary.\nUpon request, a leave shall be granted when an employee is unable to perform his\/her duties due to a serious health condition as described in the law. During the leave, the employee shall first use accumulated sick leave, as applicable, following which the employee shall have the option to use or not use all or part of accumulated vacation, personal holiday, service days, or compensatory time off, as applicable, prior to commencement of no-pay status for the balance of the leave.\nINTERMITTENT LEAVE OR REDUCED LEAVE SCHEDULE:\nWhen medically necessary due to the employee's own serious health condition, to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent of the employee, for a qualifying military exigency, or for military caregiver leave, an employee is permitted an intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule. Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single illness or injury, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include leave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks. A reduced leave schedule reduces an employee's usual number of hours per workweek and\/or per workday.\nAn employee granted an intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule may be required to temporarily transfer to an alternative position during such leave. Such alternative position shall be at the same salary as the employee's regular position. Whenever possible, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt operations.\nThe taking of leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule shall not result in a reduction in the total amount of leave to which the employee is entitled. Only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted toward the total amount of legally mandated leave time. For example, if a full-time employee works four-hour days on a reduced leave schedule, the employee would use one-half week of leave each week. The amount of leave to which a part-time employee is entitled is determined on a pro rata or proportional basis by comparing the new schedule with the employee's normal schedule.\nNOTICE:\nEmployees shall provide at least 30 days advance notice if the need for the leave is foreseeable. If 30 days notice is not practicable because of a situation outside of the employee's control, notice must be given as soon as practicable. Except in extraordinary circumstances, employees are expected to give notice within no more than one or two working days of learning of the need for leave.\nIf an employee fails to give 30 days notice for foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the University may deny the taking of leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee provided notice.\nMore information, including forms can be found in The Federal Family and Medical Leave Act Guide.\nMEDICAL CERTIFICATION:\nThe University requires a  medical certification form for FMLA absences related to illness or injury for the employee's own serious health condition, to care for a family member with a serious health condition, or for military caregiver leave. For FMLA absences related to military exigency leave a copy of the military member's active duty orders will be required.\nRequests for recertification may be made on a reasonable basis, but not to exceed once per month unless there are extenuating circumstances.\nThe University may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a second healthcare provider designated by the University (but not employed by the University). If the second opinion conflicts with that of the employee's healthcare provider, the University may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third healthcare provider designated jointly by the University and the employee. The opinion of the third healthcare provider shall be final and binding.\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or family member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this law, we are asking that employees and health care providers not provide any genetic information when responding to this request for medical information. 'Genetic Information' as defined by GINA includes an individual's family medical history, the results of an individual's or family member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual's family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.\nMEMBERSHIP IN UNIVERSITY INSURANCES WHILE ON LEAVE:\nAn employee who is absent from work but receiving pay (using sick leave, vacation, etc.) shall continue to have the employee cost for all group insurance plans in which enrolled deducted from his or her paycheck.\nAn employee on leave of absence without salary shall be eligible to continue membership in all group insurance plans in which enrolled prior to commencement of the leave. Costs for such insurances are as follows:\nFor a leave taken for the birth of a child of the employee, the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care, or the care of a seriously ill family member - for the first 12 weeks of the absence, costs for insurances shall be the employee cost (the amount that is deducted from the employee's paycheck); after the first 12 weeks of the absence, costs for insurances shall be the full cost (employee and University costs). If the employee elects to not return to work at the expiration of the leave, or returns for less than 30 calendar days, the employee will be responsible for the University's share of insurance costs paid during the first 12 weeks of the leave of absence without salary, unless there are extenuating circumstances as described in the law.\nFor a leave taken for the employee's own serious health condition costs for insurances shall be the employee cost (the amount that is deducted from the employee's paycheck).\nFor a leave taken for reasons other than those enumerated in 1 or 2 above - costs for insurances shall be the full cost (employee and University costs).\nFEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT REQUIREMENTS:\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) mandates that a qualifying employee be eligible for a total of 12 work weeks of unpaid leave, 26 weeks for military caregiver leave, during any consecutive 12-month period. As outlined in the preceding sections, all University policies equal or exceed that 12-week provision. FMLA leave may be for one or more of the following:\nthe birth of an employee's child, including prenatal doctor visits as well as caring for the newborn child;\nthe placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;\nthe care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent of the employee;\nthe employee's own serious illness which causes the employee to be unable to perform the functions of his\/her position;\na qualifying military exigency; or\nthe care of a covered service member injured in the line of duty.\nAbsences may be of an ongoing nature or, when medically necessary, may be taken as an intermittent leave or on a reduced leave schedule. Whenever possible, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule any medical treatment visits so as not to unduly disrupt operations.\nFor purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act, an eligible employee is a regular or nonregular employee who has worked for the University for at least 12 months, and has worked at least 1,250 hours within the 12-month period immediately prior to the leave.\nAn employee who is absent under the provisions of the FMLA:\nmust record the absence as such\nwho elects not to continue membership during such leave in a group insurance plan in which enrolled prior to the commencement of the leave, and subsequently elects to resume participation immediately following return to work, shall not be required to meet any qualification requirements imposed by the plan (e.g., pre-existing condition, waiting period).\nAny questions on the FMLA provisions or this policy should be referred to the appropriate Human Resources Representative or the Employee Relations Division (814-865-1412).\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially:\nHR05 - \"Regular\" and \"Nonregular\" University Employees \u00a0[POLICY NO LONGER EXISTS]\nHR16 - Leave of Absence Without Salary (Other Than For Extended Active Military Service)\nHR54 - Continuation of Group Insurance After Age 60, Age 65, and After Retirement or Death\nHRG05 - Use of \"No-Pay\" Days in Lieu of Short-Term Leave of Absence\nHRG07 - Absence From Work Resulting From Pregnancy or Childbirth\n(Major revisions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline an employee's rights for time off (paid and unpaid) necessitated by illness or family care in accordance with the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and additional provisions granted by the University."},{"university":"psu","name":"ra20","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposal Submission | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesProposal Submission \n\n\n\nResearch Administration Policies\n\nRA20\nProposal Submission\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nSubject Matter Expert:\u00a0\n\n    John Hanold,\n    814-863-0768,\n    \n      jhh6@psu.edu    \n\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Research and Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nProcess\nFurther Information\nCross-References\n\n\nPROCESS:\nFederal Awards: Guidance for the development of Federal grants and cooperative agreements can be found in Subpart C of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200). The Federal Government is required to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.202) in a prescribed format (200.203). Budgets must be prepared in accordance with the cost principles defined in Subpart E. (See also RA21.) Cost sharing, when required, should be proposed as per the guidance in 200.306. (See also RA50.) Guidance for development of cost proposals for federal contracts is found in Section 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).\nNon-Federal Awards: Proposals for non-federal awards should follow the guidelines set by the awarding organization. Federal costing policies and proposal development guidance should be used as a basis for development of these award proposals if no other guidance exists.\nAuthorization to Submit: Principal Investigators do not have the authority to submit proposals on their own. Investigators should contact their college\/unit Research Administrator as soon as they learn of a funding opportunity. This is to ensure sufficient time to develop an appropriate cost proposal, complete all sponsor-required forms and certifications, and secure all required approvals. Approval is evidenced by signatures on the proposal and on the University's Internal Approval Form (IAF). After the Principal Investigator (PI) and any co-investigators have signed the IAF, the proposal must be signed by all designated approvers, which may include the investigators' Department Heads, Associate Deans, Campus Chancellors, and\/or Campus Directors of Academic Affairs. The Associate Vice President for Research\/Director of Sponsored Programs and his or her authorized delegates serve as the final approver.\nTimeline for Submission:\u00a0Faculty members ought to provide proposal preparation staff ample time to ensure sponsor guidelines are being followed, budgets adhered to RA21, required approvals have been secured, and all forms, representations, and certifications are accurate and complete. \u00a0Proposals requiring institutional cost-sharing and\/or comment on contractual terms and conditions require additional time. As a general rule, faculty members are encouraged to submit all proposal materials to their designated proposal preparation staff at least five (5) days prior to the proposal due date. \u00a0College research offices reserve the right to establish their own internal submission timelines.\nLimited Submissions: Certain solicitations limit the number of proposals that Penn State can submit.

Both a 'general plan' and an 'annual plan' for these services may be submitted to the Commonwealth for approval each year.\nSPONSOR REQUIREMENTS:\nEach sponsor (or faculty \/ staff advisor for student groups, or sponsor representative) planning for an event anticipating the number of people specified above in the \"Purpose\" must incorporate arrangements for pre-hospital emergency medical services. The venue manager or director must contact the University Health Services' Department of Emergency Medical Services, and together (with a sponsor representative) develop a 'risk assessment' for the event. Estimates of attendees and participants, special needs of those in attendance, weather, traffic, etc. must all be taken into account in order to adequately provide for these services. Other appropriate University offices must also be included when planning for such events.\nThe Department of Emergency Medical Services will be reimbursed by the venue(or the event sponsor or the artist, as appropriate) for stand-by and any medical services rendered, and by available private insurances for any such coverable services performed.\nSPECIAL EVENTS EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES' PLANS:\nThe 'General' plan, developed by the Department of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for approval by the Department of Health, will include:\nAn outline of the organization and administration of emergency medical services for defined events held at, or sponsored by, the University,\nMinimum qualifications required of emergency care providers,\nCommunication plans, capabilities, equipment, and contingencies,\nSteps to be taken for the publishing or announcing \/ signing of available services and the location of emergency care facilities for the participants and visitors,\nRequired record keeping functions and reporting of incidents, and appropriate record retention, and\nBilling, and cost-recovery steps to be taken for services provided.\nIn addition, an 'Annual' plan may be submitted to the state Department of Health Bureau of Emergency Medical Services for their approval. EMS will coordinate with venues and sponsors to obtain and submit the following information:\nDate(s) of each event,\nSponsor(s) of each event,\nNames of artist, event title, or other identification of the event,\nVenue (Bryce Jordan Center, Eisenhower Auditorium, etc.),\nEstimated number of participants and visitors, and\nExtent of emergency medical coverage anticipated (various levels of services planned, number of EMTs, MDs, ambulances, etc.).\nNOTE: The Emergency Medical Services' fee structure must be approved by the Corporate Controller as part of the University Health Services Fees and Charges (per Policy AD15), but not necessarily included with the documentation requiring state approval.\nSmaller, low risk events are conducted frequently at certain venues(e.g., Eisenhower Auditorium, Jeffery Field, etc.). As a result of the similarity between these events, they may be included as a group in the annual plan submitted to the Department of Health. EMS will work with venue managers to combine the planning for smaller low risk events, and when possible, will address the needs of such events within the daily EMS resources of the University.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Senior Director for\u00a0University Health Services.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD39 - Minors Involved in University-Sponsored Programs or Programs Held at the University and\/or Housed in University Facilities\nSY05 - Persons, Other Than Students or Employees, Who Are Injured or Become Ill on University Property\nSY21 - First Aid Kits\nSY22 - Automated External Defibrillators (AED)\nMost recent changes:\nJune 28, 2016- Editorial changes have been made throughout the policy to clarify office\/department names.

Competitive Buying\n.... Non-Competitive Buying\n.... Justifying Fairness and Reasonableness of Price\n.... Revealing of Competitive Bids\nPlacing the Formal Purchase Order\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nINITIATING THE PURCHASE ORDER:\nAn eBuy+ Requisition, or in identified situations, a Purchase Order Requisition. This form serves ONLY as a purchase requisition, until such time as approved by Purchasing Services. In the meantime, it has served Accounting Operations as a notice of intent to use funds from a certain departmental budget or fund. Also, the purchasing agent in Purchasing Services has been alerted to secure bids, etc.\nAny questions on how to execute the eBuy+ Requisition, or the Purchase Order Requisition form, or any problem which arises in handling procurement problems, should be discussed with Purchasing Services for advice and direction.\nDETERMINATION OF ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION:\nA person or department placing a requisition for purchase has the responsibility of furnishing a sufficiently detailed description so that, when used in soliciting bids, all prospective bidders will be properly advised as to the requirement. In cases where a general description is adequate, Purchasing Services' purchasing agents will work with the department originating the purchase requisition in writing formal specifications.\nSECURING PROPER APPROVALS:\nAppropriate approvals as established by Policy\u00a0FN18 serve to indicate that the proposed purchase is needed, and to specify which available funds are to be used.\nTRANSMITTAL OF REQUISITION:\nThe completed eBuy+ Requisition proceeds in accordance with the established workflow within the purchasing system, based on roles established by each area\u2019s Financial Officer.\nEMERGENCY PURCHASES:\nWhen an emergency* arises, the faculty or staff member involved should contact Purchasing Services to explain the need. He or she will be advised by the purchasing agent of the necessary steps or action to be taken to obtain the material or service. The action taken may be telephoning of the request by the agent to a vendor, with follow-up documentation to be sent to Purchasing Services as instructed.\n* NOTE: For purposes of this policy, an emergency shall be defined as a sudden and unforeseen situation, and with the potential to pose a threat to the safety of personnel or property, requiring immediate action.\n\nQUOTATIONS AND VENDOR SELECTION:\nOne of the most important responsibilities of Purchasing Services is that of making the decision as to which vendor should be selected to supply the need. Purchasing Services is responsible for obtaining quotations from vendors when formal bidding is required. Staff members may inquire and seek product or specification information and cost estimates for budgetary purposes from prospective vendors, but unofficial quotations sent to departments from vendors create delays, duplication of effort, and confusion in the final process of preparing and placing orders by Purchasing Services.\n1. Competitive Buying:\n\nPurchasing Services is required to take mandated purchasing action and retain corresponding documentation according to the following guidelines:\n\n$ 0 - 9,999 - Competition is not required if prices from the suggested source are known to be both fair and reasonable. However, bidding may be utilized when Purchasing Services has a basis to believe that a better price can be obtained by the use of competition.\n\n$ 10,000 - 24,999 - Evidence of competitive pricing must be documented. This can be accomplished by Purchasing Services through formal bidding, electronically submitted, FAX bids, phone pricing, comparison to or use of existing contracts and cooperative buying organizations, comparison to or use of volume purchase agreements, use of previous formal competitive quotations, or other means to ensure competitive pricing.\n\n$25,000 - up - Requires a formal bidding, on-line bidding (reverse auctions), negotiation process, or use of an existing contract or approved cooperative buying agreement.\n\nALL QUOTATIONS OR OTHER MEANS TO ENSURE COMPETITIVE PRICING MUST BE OBTAINED BY PURCHASING SERVICES.\n\n2. Non-Competitive Buying:\n\n$10,000- up - Should a requisitioner determine that a specific manufacturer or brand of product is required, a written justification is required which documents the reasons why competition is or should be restricted. The \"Single\/Sole Source Justification\" must be used. The preparer must reference the eBuy+ requisition number when preparing and submitting the on-line form. After a careful review by Purchasing Services with the department or ultimate user, a decision will be rendered as to the advisability of making a non-competitive purchase. The request for a single source item or a specific brand of product does not necessarily eliminate competitive requirements, and the supplier and method of award will be ultimately determined by Purchasing Services. Through documentation, Purchasing Services must show that even sole sourced items have been purchased based on price reasonableness.\n\nIn the absence of bidding, various methods are utilized by Purchasing Services to gain assurance of reasonable prices such as, price comparisons with similar products, price lists or catalogs, or vendor contract price lists. In addition to the previous methods, Purchasing Services may also request a statement from the vendor certifying that \"No better price is offered to other customers.\"\n\n3. Justifying Fairness and Reasonableness of Price:\n\nWhen undertaking and completing purchase of goods or services, it is no longer required to document the basis of a non-competitive (sole source) purchase where the purchase price does not exceed $10,000 exclusive of shipping or transportation costs, if separately priced. While documentation of the basis for a non-competitive purchase is no longer required, purchasing agents should generate such documentation if, on an \"as needed\" basis, the buyer or purchasing agent deems it to be warranted or needed by reason of unusual circumstances or other such reasons. The foregoing does not remove the requirement to ensure and adequately document that the price to be paid by the University is both fair and reasonable. The fairness and reasonableness of a price may be affirmed by the purchasing agent affixing his or her signature to the purchase order.\n\n4. Revealing of Competitive Bids:\n\nIt is the general policy of Purchasing Services to reveal the name of the successful bidder and the price quoted. However, prices submitted by unsuccessful bidders are not disclosed.\n\nIt is also the general policy of Purchasing Services to place the order with the vendor submitting the lowest and best quotation. The University reserves the right to reject any or all bids received and, as a result, on rare occasions, the low bidder may not be accepted in view of the stringent requirements and performance of the materials or service requested.\n\nPLACING THE FORMAL PURCHASE ORDER:\nFollowing the selection of a vendor who is to supply the material or service required, a formal Purchase Order will be placed with the vendor by Purchasing Services. Orders processed via the eBuy+ Requisition will be available on-line to the originating department. Confirmation of invoices will be done via the eBuy+ Invoice Confirmation System.

The intent of this policy is to prohibit discrimination (including sexual harassment) and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a continuing affirmative program in each administrative unit outlined in the Plan. This policy of equal opportunity applies to, and must be an integral part of, every aspect of personnel policy and practice in the employment, development, advancement, and treatment of employees and applicants for employment at the University.\nRESPONSIBILITY:\nThe head of each administrative unit identified in the Affirmative Action Plan, and subunits as identified by the Affirmative Action Office, shall be responsible for working with the staff of the Affirmative Action Office in implementing the requirements of the Plan. It is the responsibility of each unit head to provide sufficient resources to administer such a program in a positive and effective manner; assure that recruitment activities reach appropriate sources of job candidates; provide reasonable opportunities to employees to enhance their skills so they may perform at their highest potential and advance in accordance with their abilities; provide training and advice to managers and supervisors to assure their understanding and implementation of the University's policy of equal opportunity and the affirmative action plan; and provide for a system within the unit for periodically evaluating the effectiveness with which the Plan is being carried out. Compliance with the intent of University Policy and the Affirmative Action Plan shall be part of the acceptable standards of performance for all employees.\nLEADERSHIP\/GUIDANCE:\nThe Affirmative Action Office, reporting to the President, shall provide leadership and guidance to administrative units in the conduct of their programs affecting employees and applicants for employment. The Affirmative Action Office shall review and evaluate administrative unit program operations periodically, obtain such reports as deemed necessary, and report to the President as appropriate on overall progress.\nThe Affirmative Action Office will consult from time to time with such individuals, groups, or organizations as may be of assistance in improving the University's program and realizing the objectives of the Plan.\nRESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS:\nThe University shall provide for the prompt, fair, and impartial consideration of all complaints of discrimination in employment, including sexual harassment, in violation of HR01  \"Fair Employment Practices.\" Each administrative unit shall provide access to counseling of employees who feel aggrieved and shall encourage the resolution of employee problems on an informal basis. Procedures for the consideration of complaints shall include at least one impartial review within the administrative unit and shall provide for appeal as outlined in\u00a0AC76 \"Faculty Rights and Responsibilities, and\u00a0HR79 \"Staff Grievance Procedure.\"\nAFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMPLIANCE:\nThe Affirmative Action Office shall be responsible for preparing guidelines and instructions necessary and appropriate to carry out the intent of the University policy and the Affirmative Action Plan.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially Policies:\nAD29 - Statement on Intolerance;\nAD41 - Sexual Harassment; and\nAD42 - Statement on Nondiscrimination.\nHR01 - Fair Employment Practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To specify terms and conditions under which the University's policy of equal employment opportunity through affirmative action shall be implemented, and identifying responsibility and accountability for actions in support of a positive program to meet legal and moral commitments as outlined in the Affirmative Action Plan."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy37","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Messaging and Cell Phone Use when Operating Vehicles while on University Business | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesText Messaging and Cell Phone Use when Operating Vehicles while on University Business \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY37\nText Messaging and Cell Phone Use when Operating Vehicles while on University Business\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nReference\nApplicability\nDefinitions\nPolicy\nFurther Information\n\n\n\nREFERENCE:\nPA Vehicle Code Title 75 section 3316.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy applies to all University employees (part-time or full-time faculty, staff, technical service) using the above-described devices while on University-related business, whether they are using University-provided vehicles or non-University provided vehicles.\u00a0 The policy applies to employees of The Pennsylvania State University, except for operators of emergency vehicles.

Written and unwritten employment policies and practices involving matters such as the commencement and duration of leave, the availability of extensions, the accrual of seniority and other benefits and privileges, and payment under any sick leave plan, shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities.\nSHORT-TERM, INFREQUENT ABSENCES:\nShort-term infrequent absences for illness resulting from pregnancy are charged to accumulated sick leave.\nPROLONGED ABSENCE RELATED TO PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH:\nWhen it is determined that the employee cannot continue actively at work prior to childbirth, the employee shall charge such absence to accumulated sick leave. (If accumulated sick leave is expended, the employee shall be placed on leave of absence without pay, with the employee's option to use or not use all or part of accumulated vacation, personal holiday, or compensatory time off prior to the leave commencing.) The length of leave of absence without pay is subject to the limitations outlined in policies covering leave of absence related to illness or injury.\nNormally, prolonged absence should begin no earlier than the eighth month of pregnancy. This is no mandate, however, that an employee must be relieved from active employment during the eight month. If the employee is healthy and able to do her work, she should continue to work beyond that time.\u00a0If, on the other hand, in the judgment of the supervisor the employee is not effectively able to continue to work, prolonged absence may commence earlier at the request of the employee, upon presentation of an acceptable written statement from the employee's attending physician stating that earlier absence is medically necessary. Such requests may be subject to review before approval by the University.\nDATE OF RETURN TO ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT:\nAt the time the employee commences prolonged absence from work prior to childbirth, the supervisor establishes a tentative date of return with the employee. Normally, the date of return should be no more than six weeks following the birth of the child, unless there are medical complications related to the childbirth which merit consideration for an extension of the absence. At the discretion of the supervisor, an employee requesting an extension may be required to submit a written statement from her attending physician indicating the medical necessity for the extension. Such requests may be subject to review before approval by the University. If the employee does not return within the time established, or any extension thereof, her employment shall be terminated.\nEARLY RETURN TO WORK:\nIf the employee desires to return to work before the agreed upon date of return, she should contact her supervisor to determine if an earlier return is feasible.\n(Retitled \"Human Resources\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To explain a female employee's rights under equal employment opportunity regulations for charging absences to sick leave accumulation, or for a leave of absence without pay because of pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth, and recovery therefrom.

The last day worked is the date of termination, and the dollar value of any unused vacation accumulation due, in accordance with applicable policy or contract provisions, is paid to the employee in a lump sum payment. (See also HRG14 - Establishing Date of Termination of Employment Occurring Near Christmas\/New Year's Holiday Period).\nUSE OF VACATION BALANCE PRIOR TO RETIREMENT WITH ELIGIBILITY FOR UNIVERSITY INSURANCE:\nAn employee who: (a) earns vacation on a formal plan, and\u00a0(b) has an unused vacation balance, and (c) is retiring from the University, and (d) qualifies to continue the University's insurance into retirement, shall select one of two alternatives for using such unused vacation, subject to approval by the employee's administrative officer. The first alternative provides that all accumulated vacation days be used before the effective date of retirement. The second alternative provides that the employee may use some vacation or not, and receive a lump sum payment for any vacation balance left as of the date of the retirement.\nCOMPLETION OF, OR RETIREMENT FROM, A FIXED-TERM I APPOINTMENT:\nSpecial attention must also be given to the situation wherein an employee on a Fixed-Term I appointment will not be continued beyond the ending date of the appointment to insure that, either accumulated vacation has already been used prior to the completion of the appointment, or that budgetary arrangements have been effected to provide payment of the unused vacation balance.

If the original transaction of merchandise or service was paid by check, a 1 week waiting period (for the check to clear the bank) should be adhered to before a refund is processed.\nRETAIL OPERATION:\nIf an area of the University exchanges merchandise or services with the public for payment on a regular basis more than one day a week and credits the revenues to an 08-XXX-XX Budget (or the operation is documented in a procedure published by Systems and Procedures), that activity shall be referred to for the purpose of this policy as a \"retail operation.\" Refer to Policy FN14 for additional information.\nA retail operation may issue a cash refund of $100 or less directly to a customer if a Refund Request Form is completed, signed by the supervisor, and retained in accordance with the instructions  in GURU.\nAll refunds (See specific \"Exceptions\" above) greater than $100 to be issued by retail operations are processed on a\u00a0Refund Request in accordance with the instructions in GURU. A University check will be issued to the person named on the request form. A retail operation may use the Refund Request for all refunds if it so chooses.\nNON-RETAIL OPERATION:\nAll other activities not under the above definition of a retail operation shall be considered as \"non-retail.\"\nA non-retail operation may issue a cash refund of $10 or less directly to a customer if a Cash Refund Receipt is completed, signed by the supervisor, and retained in accordance with the instructions  in GURU. If current revenues are not adequate, additional sources of cash for the refunds may be a Petty Cash Fund (if available) or the Cash Operating Fund.\nAll refunds (See specific \"Exceptions\" above) greater than $10 to be issued by non-retail operations must be processed on a Refund Request in accordance with the instructions in GURU. A University check will be issued to the person named on the request form. A non-retail operation may use the Refund Request for all refunds if it so chooses.\nREFUNDS BY MAIL:\nAll refunds not issued in person must be processed via the Refund Request form.\nOPTION OF NO REFUNDS:\nBoth a retail or a non-retail operation may adopt a local policy of no refunds. If an operation selects not to issue refunds, then a statement indicating the \"no refund\" policy must be clearly posted at the point of transaction, or appear on the sales receipt. Despite any no refund policy, merchandise must meet warranty of merchantability requirements. Defective merchandise must either be replaced or a refund must be issued.\nCREDIT SLIP PROHIBITION:\nIt is prohibited to issue any kind of a credit slip (except gift certificates and refund certificates issued according to Procedure # CR2052, Accounting For Coupons and Gift Certificates) to an individual in lieu of a refund with the intent of having the individual redeem the credit slip at a later time.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: January 16, 1996\u00a0\n\tDate Approved: January 16, 1996\u00a0\n\tDate Published: January 31, 1996 (Editorial changes- September 25, 2013)\nMost recent changes:\nSeptember 25, 2013 - Editorial changes to reflect current operations, and to reflect the addition of policy steward information, in the event that there are questions or requests for changes to the policy.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nNovember 15, 2010 - Editorial changes to \"Exceptions,\" Credit Card Refunds, to bring things into sync with FN07 verbiage on the handling of refunds for credit card sales.\nJune 14, 2006 - Revision History added.\nJune 8, 2005 - Editorial changes to eliminate \"General Forms Usage Guide\" references, and to add the correct links for the forms referenced in the policy.\nJanuary 16, 1996 - Removed reference to Bookstore and reorganized for GURU.\nAugust 18, 1992 - Major revisions.\nJuly 25, 1986 - Renumbered and relocated from Policy CS-8, dated 7-25-83 (Cash and Sales section is now the \"Financial\" section)\nJune 1, 1982 - Retyped without change from Commonwealth Campus Policy CS-9 (September, 1978) and University Park Policy CS-6 (September, 1966)\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nJanuary 16, 1996>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nJanuary 31, 1996>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nJanuary 16, 1996>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the University's Policy on all refunds, except tuition refunds and other refunds covered by specific University policies or procedures, with the following exceptions:"},{"university":"psu","name":"ad26","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSale and Serving of Food and Beverages at University Locations | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesSale and Serving of Food and Beverages at University Locations \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD26\nSale and Serving of Food and Beverages at University Locations\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nExternal Providers\nPolicy\nTerms of Agreement\nRegulated Beverage Sales\nFood and Beverage Vending Machines \nAdvertising and\/or Solicitation of Funds\n\nFood Sampling\nEvents at Personal Residences\nExceptions\nFurther Information\n\n\nDEFINITIONS:\n\u201cRegulated Beverage\u201d or \u201cRegulated Beverages\u201d means all carbonated and non-carbonated, non-alcoholic drinks, however dispensed, including but not limited to: i) colas and other flavored carbonated drinks: ii) fruit juice, fruit juice containing and fruit flavored drinks; iii) ready-to-drink chilled coffee drinks; iv) chilled tea products; v) hypertonic, isotonic and hypotonic drinks (sport drinks and fluid replacements); vi) energy drinks, vii) packaged carbonated or still water (including spring, mineral or purified); viii) liquid concentrate teas (\u201cLCT\u201d); ix) frozen carbonated and non-carbonated beverages (\u201cFB\u201d); and x) any future categories of nonalcoholic beverage products that may be distributed by Pepsi.\nEXTERNAL PROVIDERS:\nAn ongoing concern of the University regarding the sale of food is the potential risk arising from the improper handling of food products. Sanitation, prevention of pest infestation, garbage removal, equipment requirements and proper cleanup after an event are problems associated with the preparation and serving of food and are best dealt with by University food service departments or commercial companies with the appropriate skills and expertise. If such preparation and serving of food is not done by University food service departments, the University will require adequate insurance from the contracted provider. The Risk Management Office has established insurance standards and is to be contacted in advance of the function so they may determine if the contracted provider meets all requirements. Risk Management is located in 103 Rider Building, 814-865-6307 (FAX: 814-865-4029).\nNOTE: Risk Management maintains a current listing of all accepted external food and beverage providers that might provide services to the University at any location. That list is available HERE.\nAll contracts with external food and beverage providers are subject to\u00a0Policy FN11, Contracts and Leases.\nPOLICY:\nAt University Park, the sale or service of food and\/or beverages at any function or program open to the public and\/or community by other than authorized University departments such as Housing and Food Services, Penn State Hospitality Services,University Creamery, or by an accepted external food and beverage provider contracting for food and beverage services, is prohibited.\nAt Commonwealth campus locations where the University operates a food service program, the University's Food Services has the right of first refusal to sell and\/or serve food and beverage services in all University owned and leased property, unless a specific exception is approved, as covered under the \"Exceptions\" section of this policy.\nWhen food and beverage services are provided by an accepted external food and beverage provider on University owned and leased property, such provider must comply with the contractual terms of agreements noted below. The sponsoring organization or group will reimburse the University for identifiable increments to theUniversity's operating or overhead expenses incurred by the use of the facility.\nAll food and snacks served and\/or sold by recognized student organizations, otherUniversity organizations or offices, and residence hall house governments onUniversity property are prohibited, as are food and beverage sales by individual members and clubs of the University community and by faculty, staff and students unless a specific exception is approved, as covered under the \"Exceptions\" section of this policy.\nNOTE: This policy does not restrict an individual from placing an order for food and beverages with a commercial food vendor for delivery to their office or on-campus residence. This policy does not restrict an individual from purchasing beverage products from local off-campus outlets and bringing the product to campus for individual use. If resales occur, any funds collected cannot exceed the purchase cost. \nTERMS OF AGREEMENT:\nThe University has entered into an agreement with Pepsi for specific beverage products, however dispensed. The terms of the agreement are for a 10-year period beginning July 01, 2012 through June 30, 2022. A contract year is a consecutive 12-month period beginning July 01, 2012. The Pepsi Agreement covers all University locations, except The Pennsylvania College of Technology. A number of the campuses have contracts of various lengths for vended products and\/or snack bar operations. This agreement does not alter those contracts. However, upon renewal, changes identified below must be incorporated into the agreement.\nDue to the agreement between the University and the contracted vendor, any employee representing the University in an official capacity while on-campus (e.g., interviews, open meetings, etc.) should refrain from using beverage products that are in competition with the contracted vendor.\nREGULATED BEVERAGE SALES:\nThe University agrees during the term of the Agreement to purchase its total requirements of Regulated Beverages from the contracted vendor.\nThe University is prohibited from selling products that are competitive to the contracted vendor.\nUniversity locations that have contracts with private companies for snack bar operations, foodservice operations and\/or vending are mandated to include in future contracts a requirement that all Regulated Beverage products be purchased from the University's contracted vendor.\nFOOD AND BEVERAGE VENDING MACHINES:\nAt University Park, all vending machine services are provided by a contracted agency, as administered by Housing and Food Services. No University department or individual shall enter into any agreement with any company or organization for the provision of vending machine services.\nAt Commonwealth Campus locations, food and beverage vending machine services are provided by a vending company under contract to the University. Where there is a Housing and Food Service program, Housing and Food Services has the responsibility for contracting for campus vending services. At other locations, the Associate Vice President for Finance and Business has the responsibility for contracting these services.\nAll vending commission income (including income from candy, gum, and hot and cold beverage machines) is to be deposited into specified accounts under the jurisdiction of the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business.\nADVERTISING AND\/OR SOLICITATION OF FUNDS:\nThe University agrees to cooperate in marketing programs\/activities which the contracted vendor creates and funds which promote the sale of contracted vendor products at University locations throughout Pennsylvania. Each individual marketing program\/activity must be mutually agreed to by the University and the contracted vendor.\nThe contracted vendor shall be the exclusive beverage sponsor at all the University's athletic events.\nFOOD SAMPLING:\n\"Food Sampling\" is the free distribution of a food product for the purpose of promoting that product.\nSampling may be permitted in University hotels and conference center, student unions, residence hall commons buildings, the Mateer Building, and sports venues subject to the following conditions:\nNo alcohol or tobacco products will be permitted.\nFood items must be pre-packed, or if prepared on-site must be supervised by a qualified food service professional. State and local health codes must be followed.\nApproval to conduct food sampling activities at all specified University facilities must be obtained in advance of the event. Requests for approval shall be submitted to the University administrator responsible for the operations of the specific facility. The administrator may set restrictions on the sampling activity, such as time, place and manner of presentation.\nConflicts with existing agreements or ongoing operations of the University may result in approval being denied.\nThe vendor or company providing the sampled products will be responsible for all cleanup costs associated with the sampling activity in the facility and\/or the surrounding area as determined by the facility administrator. An advance deposit may be required.\nEVENTS AT PERSONAL RESIDENCES:\nGroup meals or meetings held at private residences are not covered by University insurance, with the exception of Deans, Chancellors, Vice Presidents, Vice Provosts and other specifically designated senior executives. The use of a caterer is not required for events at an employee's home.\u00a0 The employee should be aware that their personal homeowner's policy would be the primary liability insurance coverage for these events, given that the host held the event at their home and was responsible for controlling the circumstances of the event. However, if a caterer is used, the caterer must be from the List of Caterers maintained by Risk Management, having adequate insurance coverage.\nEXCEPTIONS:\nIn University facilities and\/or at University locations where University food services has the right of first refusal to provide catered food and beverages, the Director of Housing and Food Services (or their designee) can authorize an exception in advance of the event if University Food Services does not have the culinary arts expertise required for the successful execution of the event. In University facilities and\/or at University locations where a non-University owned or managed food service operates, the Director of Business Services (or their designee) can authorize exceptions.\nRecognized student organizations, other University organizations or offices (if used as a fund raiser for The United Way), and residence hall house governments may be granted an exception if the food sales provide a service that is not provided by Housing and FoodServices or by an authorized agent currently under contract to provide these services. Recognized student organizations granted permission to sell food and\/or beverages for a specific activity may use the funds in excess of the cost for the benefit of the student organization.\nBecause of the ongoing concern regarding the safe and proper handling of food products, food sales by recognized student organizations will be limited to products: 1) prepared by a external food and beverage provider or University food service, 2) are not required to be temperature controlled, and 3) that are prepackaged for resale.\nFor recognized student organizations, requests for exceptions to the above policy requirements at University Park are submitted to the UniversityPark Housing and Food Services Office through the Office of Union and StudentActivities. Requests for exception from other University locations are submitted to the respective campus\/college Housing and Food Service Office through the Office of Student Programs and Services. (At locations with noHousing and Food Services Operations, the request is submitted directly to theDirector of Business Services.) After the application is reviewed with the respective offices as appropriate, actions relative to the request will be issued in writing from the Housing and Food Services Office (or the Office of Student Programs and Services, as appropriate).\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Risk Management Office.\nMost Recent Changes:\nJanuary 13, 2014 - Editorial changes. An EVENTS AT PERSONAL RESIDENCES section was added to the policy to clarify coverage parameters, as this policy is intended to apply to caterers providing services to University-sponsored events regardless of where the event takes place, meaning events held off University campuses as well as on campus. Also, policy steward information has been added, to provide guidance in the event that there are questions or requests for changes to the policy.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 19, 2013 - Changes made throughout the policy to reflect the continuance of the University's agreement with Pepsi.

Employment other than under these specific exceptions will result in the termination of SERS annuity payments for the period of such employment; in addition, other penalties may apply.\nPennsylvania law provides that a SERS annuitant may continue to receive his or her annuity, in accordance with the following provisions: 1) there exists an emergency situation that creates an increase in the workload such that there is a serious impairment of service to the public (emergency return to service); 2) in special circumstances that permit the individual to be retained as an independent contractor (IRS regulations narrowly proscribe the circumstances under which an annuitant may be considered an independent contractor).\nIn all cases, one pay period must have elapsed following termination of or retirement from full-time employment prior to a post-retirement appointment.\nIn the event of an emergency return to service of a SERS annuitant, he or she must be paid on the wage payroll and the period of such employment may not exceed an aggregate of ninety-five (95) working days in one calendar year. Any amount of time worked less than one-half of a day shall be counted as one-half a day for the purposes of calculating time worked; time worked in excess of one-half a day shall be counted as a full day. The wages received shall not be considered compensation for retirement purposes. The service performed will not be considered creditable service and, as such, no SERS contributions will be withheld. The individual must be advised in writing of these conditions prior to accepting the post-retirement appointment. Any University retiree benefits in effect prior to post-retirement appointment shall continue.\nPUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM\nOther than a few limited exceptions, Pennsylvania law provides that a PSERS annuitant may not be employed by the University, on a part-time basis, and continue to receive annuity payments from the Public School Employees' Retirement System. Employment other than under these limited exceptions will result in the termination of PSERS annuity payments for the period of such employment; in addition, other penalties may apply.\nA PSERS annuitant may be hired and continue to receive his or her annuity, in accordance with the following provisions: 1) an emergency exists that creates a serious impairment of service or there is a shortage of subject-certified teachers (emergency return to service); 2) if employed part-time in an extra-curricular capacity, performed primarily outside the regular instructional hours and not part of the mandated curriculum; 3) if employed full-time and enrolled in an alternate approved pension plan offered by the University; 4) in special circumstances that permit the individual to be retained as an independent contractor (IRS regulations narrowly proscribe the circumstances under which an annuitant may be considered an independent contractor). In all cases,\u00a090 days must have elapsed following termination of or retirement from full-time employment prior to a post-retirement appointment.\nIn the event of an emergency return to service of a PSERS annuitant, he or she must be paid on the wage payroll and the period of such employment may not exceed beyond the length of the school year (fall to summer) in which the emergency or shortage occurs. The wages received shall not be considered compensation for retirement purposes. The service performed will not be considered creditable service and, as such, no PSERS contributions will be withheld. Any University retiree benefits in effect prior to post-retirement appointment shall continue. The individual must be advised in writing of these conditions prior to accepting the post-retirement appointment.\nIn addition, PSERS annuitants hired in a part-time extra-curricular (for example, activities such as ushering at Bryce Jordan Center events or other sporting events) capacity, the retiree will need to sign a waiver with the following language:\n\u00a0\n\"By entering into this contract, Retiree agrees that neither the Retiree, nor the public school employer, shall make any contributions to the Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) on account of any service performed under this contract. Retiree further agrees to waive all retirement benefits (including but not limited to benefits from aMultiple Service election) from PSERS that could arise from service performed under this contract, and shall release and hold harmless both the public school employer and PSERS from any liability for the payment of retirement benefits that could arise from service performed under this contract.\"\nKeep a copy of the signed waiver with employment records and provide a copy to the annuitant.\nSERS AND PSERS EMERGENCY RETURN TO SERVICE FACTORS:\nIn the absence of a reason to conclude otherwise, SERS and PSERS will rely on a participating employer's (Penn State's) determination that an \"emergency creates an increase in the workload such that there is serious impairment of service to the public, \"justifying an annuitant's return to service in a post-retirement appointment. If, however, SERS or PSERS has reason to believe that the return to service might not meet the standards set by law, an investigation will be undertaken, and if necessary, a member's retirement benefits will be adjusted. The adjustment of retirement benefits could include requiring the member to repay annuity payments improperly received, recalculating service credit, or other appropriate corrections to ensure that retirement funds are properly dispersed.\nFactors that the courts have considered, and therefore, that Penn State will consider before hiring an annuitant under emergency return to service provisions are set forth below. In the event that SERS or PSERS investigates the circumstances of an annuitant's return to service, these factors and any other relevant factors will be taken into consideration.\nTest of Notice and Timing\nWhether there was a bona fide break in service between retirement and return to a post-retirement appointment\nThe amount of time before retirement that the member notifies the employer of their intent to retire\nWhether the rehiring was planned before the retirement\nWhether, taken together, the retirement and rehiring appeared to be a preconceived retirement plan\nWhether the employee created the so-called \"emergency\" by retiring\nTest of Recruitment and Hiring Approval\nWhether the employer sought approval to replace the terminated employee\nWhether approval to hire was granted, and if so; when\nWhether the employer immediately undertook a search for a replacement promptly upon notice of the employee's retirement\nWhether the employer conducted a search for a replacement before re-hiring the annuitant\nWhether there was a shortage of appropriate personnel\nWhether the employer made a bona fide effort to fill the emergency vacancy with a non-retiree\nWhether the re-hire was for a discreet period or whether it was to last only until a successor was hired\nThis list is not exclusive. Penn State may also consider any other factor (s) that would be useful in determining whether the standards of emergency return to service are satisfied. SERS\/PSERS will consider all relevant factors using a preponderance of evidence standard in conducting an investigation.\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SERS AND PSERS ANNUITANTS:\nAnnuitants who are contemplating a post-retirement appointment or who are being approached to return to service in any capacity, including under the applicable extra-curricular or emergency return to service provisions, should be encouraged to consult the SERS or PSERS Regional Counseling Center in their area. Retirement counselors are available to provide important information and factors to consider so that the individual returning is fully aware of the consequences of the decision.\nTEACHERS INSURANCE AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATION\/COLLEGE RETIREMENT EQUITIES FUND ANNUITANTS:\nA TIAA\/CREF annuitant may be employed by the University only on a temporary basis and continue to receive such annuity payments to which he or she is entitled. When an employee of the University retires, this action will, in most cases, conclude the person's employment with the University. The University expects and requires effective succession planning. University retiree re-employment cannot be used as a substitute for developing well-qualified faculty and staff.\n\u00a0\nThe retiree shall be paid on the wage payroll and wages received on post-retirement appointment shall not be considered compensation for retirement purposes. The service performed will not be considered creditable service and, as such, no contributions will be withheld. The individual considering returning must be advised in writing of these conditions prior to accepting the post-retirement appointment. Any University retiree benefits in effect prior to the post-retirement appointment shall continue.\nDETERMINING RATE OF PAY:\nThe rate of pay for a post-retirement appointment shall be recommended by the dean or administrative officer and approved by the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee), in consultation with the Vice Provost and other administrators as necessary and appropriate. When determining an annuitant's rate of pay, the dean or administrative officer will consider the following nonexclusive list of factors: salary at time of retirement; market; departmental budget; and type of responsibilities to be performed. In general, an annuitant's rate of pay should not exceed the hourly equivalent of the University salary earned at the time of retirement, with adjustment permissible for any general salary increases that have occurred in the interim. Teaching responsibilities will be compensated with an eye toward the University's \"Part-time Faculty, Fixed-Term II\" schedule (see HR06 - Types of Appointments). Other responsibilities such as research shall be prorated as appropriate to the workload and compensation in the respective work unit.\nSERVICES AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR:\nThe tax law narrowly proscribes circumstances under which a retiree providing services to the University may be considered to be an independent contractor. Thus, a retiree providing services (including one who has affiliated with a separate company or business entity) may only be compensated outside of the University's Payroll System if he or she is performing services entirely separate and unrelated to his or her prior University employment duties. Such services must be distinct from the retiree's prior employment duties and be performed outside of the College or Unit from which the individual retired. Retirees being employed through \"temporary agencies\" are subject to the same guidelines. Guidance must be sought, and approval given by theUniversity's Tax Director (or designee), before commitments are made to retain the services of a retiree as an independent contractor.\nPROCEDURE:\nDiscussions about post-retirement appointments or services as an independent contractor between the individual and the department head\/supervisor, area Human Resources Representative, and the Office of Human Resources should occur as soon as the need for post-retirement appointment is identified by the area and before initiating action. In this way, guidance can be provided to benefit both the University and the employee and remain in compliance with the requirements of SERS. All post-retirement appointments must be approved by either the Office of Human Resources or Tax Office in advance. Post-retirement appointment approval cannot be granted retroactively.\nEmployment Appointment\nFor all post-retirement situations, prior to any commitment being made, a letter requesting a post-retirement employment appointment shall be initiated by the department head or supervisor, endorsed by the appropriate dean or administrative officer, submitted to the Human Resources Representative who submits the request to the Vice President for Human Resources (or designee) for approval. The request shall contain specific information on the need, suggested pay, length of time of recommended employment or retention of services, and a summary of steps that have been taken to solve the problem in another way.\nAppointment Outside the Payroll\nPrior to any commitment being made to pay a retiree that will be compensated outside of the Payroll System, a letter requesting a post-retirement appointment of an independent contractor(or business entity supplying a retiree's services) shall be initiated by the department head or supervisor, endorsed by the appropriate dean or administrative officer, and submitted to the University's Tax Director (or designee) for approval.

This policy covers original instructional materials developed by faculty as intellectual products and printed and sold by Document Services, as well as by other publishing companies and copying services, and regardless of the tangible medium of expression on which they are fixed, printed, recorded, posted, displayed or distributed.\nFaculty members may receive reasonable royalty payments on certain kinds of original instructional materials used in Penn State courses including, but not limited to, noncommissioned courseware modules. Faculty members seeking royalty payments on materials sold to Penn State students must obtain written approval prior to receiving payment of such royalties in order to ensure that the payment of royalties is reasonable and justified in accordance with the guidelines set forth below, and that students are not financially exploited.\nA written request for receipt of royalty payments describing the original instructional materials in question, the course(s) in which the materials are to be used, and the estimated overall cost to students must be submitted either to the department\/division head or a peer committee in accordance with unit practice. A written decision must be rendered within one month of the initial request. If the requested royalty payments are denied, or a reduction from the initial request by the faculty member is recommended, the written decision must include an explanation of the reasoning, together with a recommendation of what a reasonable royalty payment would be if any payment is allowed.\nIf the College or department \/division or peer committee denies the faculty member\u2019s receipt of royalty payments, the faculty member should determine what happens to the royalty payment, subject to the review of the department\/division head or a peer committee in accordance with unit practice.\u00a0 Examples of acceptable disposal of the royalties could be (a) to Penn State, (b) to a reputable charity, or (c) to a reduction of the students\u2019 cost of the materials associated with the specific course.\nFaculty members who dispute the department\/division head or peer committee decision regarding reasonable royalties may seek a review by the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee of the University Faculty Senate in cooperation with the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.\nIn accordance with the general standards of professional ethics embodied in AD47, faculty members also have an ethical obligation when they collect any royalty payments for any instructional materials to reveal those payments to all those affected, including but not limited to, the Penn State students in those courses.\nADVISORY GUIDELINES REGARDING PEER AFFIRMATION AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS:\nIn applying and interpreting the advisory guidelines established here, the academic administrator or peer committee should apply them in light of the overarching goal of this policy set forth above.\nIn every course there is some essential core of information that the instructor has been paid to organize and deliver and that students have paid to receive. Normally this essential core goes beyond course material prepared by others to include the faculty member's own intellectual contributions, which may include printed or posted materials. Therefore, a royalty payment is not automatically reasonable and justified for printed or posted material of the faculty member's own creation.\nIn light of Guideline No. 2, a royalty payment is not reasonable or justified for printed or posted materials that are customary to a faculty member's core contribution to the conduct of a course, including but not limited to a course syllabus, reading schedules, versions of lecture notes, packets of what would otherwise be \"handouts\" of illustrative material used in class, and collections of copied readings or other printed material authored or prepared by others that are merely assembled and organized by the faculty member for the convenience of students.\nA reasonable royalty payment to the faculty member may be justified for printed or posted course materials if they represent a substantial intellectual product contribution by the faculty member and if they bring added value to a course as a supplement to the faculty member's core contribution. For instance, if the course could be taught using a commercially available text or manual in lieu of the printed materials prepared by the faculty member, or if the faculty member's printed materials could plausibly be used as supporting material in a similar course at another institution, then those materials may be considered a substantial intellectual product contribution. In addition, a royalty payment normally is justified only if the academic quality of the material has been verified by an independent academic review, using reviewers that were not selected by the faculty member receiving the royalty payment.\nFaculty members are ethically obligated not to financially exploit students (see AD47, Part II, \"General Standards of Professional Ethics\"). Procedures currently exist under AC76 (\"Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\") and RA10 (\"Handling Inquiries\/Investigations into Questions of Ethics in Research and in Other Scholarly Activities\") to deal with alleged violations of this ethical standard. Faculty members should avoid conflicts of interest in making academic and\/or financial decisions regarding students (see HR91, \"Conflict of Interest\").\nRoyalty payments for textbooks and other books authored, co-authored, or edited by a faculty member are typically reasonable, and are excluded from this policy provided that: (a) their use is reasonably related to the purpose of the course for which they are assigned; (b) they have been published by an academic or commercial press in which the faculty member does not hold an ownership or vested interest; (c) they have been subject to a peer review process in their publication by an independent authority with reviewers that were not selected by the faculty member, and; (d) they have been produced for use beyond Penn State courses. Nevertheless, faculty members who author, co-author, or edit such publications and assign them to the courses they teach are required to submit them for approval to the academic administrator or peer committee described above to avoid either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nFaculty members may want to assign course materials that are to be purchased by the students from a company from which the faculty member has received payment for consulting or other services.\u00a0 Such payments should be disclosed to the academic administrator or peer committee for consideration regardless of whether the payments are royalties.\nThe appropriate academic administrator or peer committee, according to unit practice, is responsible for determining the reasonableness of the royalty amount. In making this determination, the administrator or committee may, among other things, take into account factors such as standard royalty payments in academic publishing, royalties typically paid for reproduction permissions, and the percentage of the royalty payment in relation to the price for which the work is sold to students. These factors are merely suggestions and are not intended to be exhaustive of other considerations determined to be relevant by the appropriate academic administrator or peer committee.\nAll decisions about royalty payments must be consistent with the policies laid out in IP03 concerning the appropriate assignment of royalties.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nRelated policies include:\nAD47 - General Standards of Professional Ethics\nFN14 - Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services\nAC76 - Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\nHR90 - Extra Compensation for Exempt Staff Employees\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest\nIP01 - Patents and Copyrights (Intellectual Property; formerly RA11)\nIP03 - Courseware\nIP05 - Policy Governing Copyright Clearance (formerly AD46)\nEffective Date: January 7, 2013\n\tDate Approved: September 14, 2012\n\tDate Published: January 7, 2013 (Editorial changes- November 19, 2015)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 19, 2015 - Editorial changes.

The professional societies provide an opportunity to maintain and upgrade competence and professional standards by face to face discussions, by journals distributed as part of the membership, and by meetings where papers are presented.\nMEMBERSHIPS:\nWhen dues or fees are paid by the University, membership in a professional society or association is considered to be an institutional membership in the name of the University. In most instances, a senior staff member (General Officer, Staff Officer, Dean, Department Head, and Professor) is named as the institutional representative to represent the University.\nThe senior staff member may vote in the name of the University and may hold office in the organization.\nAPPROVAL OF MEMBERSHIPS:\nInstitutional memberships will be considered when it appears to be in the best interest of the University. Proposals are made through the appropriate University budget executive by means of a properly signed Special Request for Check with an attached invoice. All subsequent renewals, must also be approved by the budget executive.\nINDIVIDUAL MEMBERSHIPS:\nNormally, the University will not pay for individual memberships to organizations. However, some organizations are structured in such a way that only individual memberships are available. In rare instances where, in the judgement of the budget executive, the University can only be represented in such a manner, charges for individual memberships will be processed for payment. Requests for approval are made via a Special Request for check as indicated above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To state University policies concerning memberships in professional societies, associations, or organizations."},{"university":"psu","name":"ac70","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDismissal Procedure for Tenured and Tenure-Eligible Faculty Members | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesDismissal Procedure for Tenured and Tenure-Eligible Faculty Members \n\n\n\nAcademic Policies\n\nAC70\nDismissal Procedure for Tenured and Tenure-Eligible Faculty Members                (Formerly  HR70)\n\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice Provost for Faculty Affairs>\n\u00a0\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: November 23, 2005\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: November 23, 2005\nPurpose\nScope\nAdequate Cause\nInitiation of Dismissal Process\nStanding Joint Committee on Tenure\n.... Role of the Committee\n.... Establishment of the Committee\n.... Committee Procedural Rules\nFinancial Exigency or Program Elimination or Revision\nCross References\n\n\nSCOPE:\nIn the event that the University Administration seeks to dismiss a tenured faculty member for adequate cause, or seeks to dismiss a tenure-eligible faculty member during the provisional appointment period with less advance notice than that specified in AC23 Section IV.8, the faculty member shall be accorded due process, as is required by applicable law as specified in this AC70 Policy, including an opportunity for a hearing before the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure, prior to termination. Cases of substantive dispute involving the termination of a tenured appointment for reasons of financial exigency or program elimination or revision also shall be considered at a hearing by the Committee.\nADEQUATE CAUSE:\nA tenured or tenure eligible faculty member may be dismissed for adequate cause as determined in accordance with this policy. Adequate cause shall mean any one of the following: (i) lack of competence or failure to perform in relation to the functions required by the appointment, (ii) excessive absenteeism, (iii) moral turpitude, or (iv) grave misconduct. Dismissal for adequate cause will not be used to restrain or otherwise affect faculty members in the exercise of their individual or collective academic freedom or in contravention of other legal rights. Standards of notice as specified in AC23 Section IV.8 are not required in cases of dismissal for adequate cause.\nINITIATION OF DISMISSAL PROCESS\nA.The Steps That Shall be Followed to Initiate the Dismissal Process\nWithin a reasonable time after the occurrence of events that might give rise to termination for adequate cause are made known to the appropriate administrator(s), the faculty member will be provided with written notice from the administrator(s) of the alleged misconduct constituting adequate cause. The notice shall include a copy of or references to this AC70 policy and sufficient information concerning the allegations to enable the faculty member to make a meaningful response.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe faculty member will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegations either in writing or at a meeting with the appropriate administrator(s), or both, at the discretion of the faculty member against whom allegations of misconduct have been made. The affected faculty member shall be accorded a reasonable amount of time to prepare a response to the allegations.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe faculty member shall have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate administrator(s) and he or she will be given an explanation of the alleged misconduct. The administrator, at his or her discretion, may respond to the written submissions of the faculty member at this meeting. The appropriate ombudsman shall be present as an objective, informational resource at the meeting unless the faculty member waives, in writing, the right to have the ombudsman present. The meeting may be continued at the discretion of the administrator(s) should there be a need for additional time to resolve the matter or to obtain additional information or otherwise for other good cause.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFollowing this meeting, the faculty member will again be given an opportunity to respond in writing to the administrator(s).\nB.Process After Initial Meeting\nThe purpose of the meeting(s) and responses listed above is to provide both parties with an understanding of the other party's position, as well as an opportunity to settle the matter without formal action.\nIf after the initial meeting an agreement is reached between the appropriate administrator(s) and the faculty member, then the matter will be resolved in accordance with the agreement.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIf after the initial meeting(s) the matter remains unresolved, the appropriate administator(s) may choose to dismiss the matter if no serious concerns remain regarding the faculty member's alleged misconduct. If serious concerns remain, the appropriate Dean will consult with the Executive Vice President and Provost about what further action, if any, should be taken.\nC.Referral to Standing Joint Committee on Tenure\nIf both the Dean and the Executive Vice President and Provost concur that the disciplinary sanction of termination for adequate cause is warranted under the circumstances, the matter will be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure. The Dean will promptly advise the faculty member of that determination in writing by letter addressed to the affected faculty member and the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure. The Dean's letter shall set forth the specific basis for seeking adequate cause termination and the specific conduct which serves as the basis for the termination. Such written notification will advise the faculty member that the matter will be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure, unless the faculty member requests the opportunity to resign in lieu of termination.\nD.Suspension Pending Ruling by Standing Joint Committee on Tenure\nOrdinarily, the affected faculty member shall not be suspended prior to a final decision by the President.Suspension of the faculty member prior to a final decision by the President is justified only if there is reason to believe that material harm to the University, its faculty, staff, or students will occur or be threatened by the faculty member's continued active status during the proceedings. The suspension decision shall be made by the appropriate Dean with the concurrence of the Executive Vice President and Provost. The suspended faculty member shall be informed of the reasons warranting his or her suspension and may make a written objection to the suspension to the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure. Any such suspension shall be with full pay and benefits.\nE.Burden of Proof\nThe burden of proof that adequate cause exists for the dismissal of the faculty member, or that substantial grounds exist justifying dismissal for financial exigency and program elimination, or revision, rests with theUniversity and shall be satisfied only by clear and convincing evidence in the record considered as a whole.\nSTANDING JOINT COMMITTEE ON TENURE:\n\nRole of the Committee\nThe Standing Joint Committee on Tenure acts solely in an advisory capacity to the President on matters pertinent to the dismissal of tenured or tenure-eligible faculty. It holds hearings to receive evidence and adjudicate the matter and to provide the President with a reasoned opinion and recommendation for action with respect to the request to dismiss a faculty member. The Standing Joint Committee on Tenure shall exercise its obligations in accordance with the procedural rules described in this AC70.\n\n\nEstablishment of the Committee\nThe Standing Joint Committee on Tenure shall consist of five members: two members selected by the administration, and three tenured faculty members selected by the elected faculty members of the University Senate. The Chair will be chosen by the Committee from the elected tenured faculty members.\n\n\nCommittee Procedural Rules\n\n\nPreliminary Evaluation. The Standing Joint Committee on Tenure will first evaluate whether or not the charges of misconduct described in the Dean's letter, if true, constitute adequate cause for dismissal. If the Committee rules that the charges, taken as true, do not constitute adequate cause for dismissal, the Committee will issue a pre-hearing report, recommending to the President that no further proceedings occur. If the President agrees with the Committee's pre-hearing report, he or she will terminate the dismissal process. However, should the President disagree with this initial determination, he or she shall so notify the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure and theStanding Joint Committee on Tenure shall, promptly upon receipt of this notice, conduct the hearing described below.\nShould the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure rule that the charges may, if proven, constitute adequate cause for dismissal, the hearing will be conducted and all parties will be notified in writing.\n\n\nCommencement of Hearing. The faculty member against whom dismissal is sought shall have the opportunity to be heard and present his or her own defense before the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure. The Standing Joint Committee on Tenure shall convene a hearing within sixty (60) days, if reasonably possible, after the date of the Dean's letter referring the matter to the Committee. The hearing shall be limited to the matters described in the letter relating to the grounds on which termination of the faculty member is sought. Except in extenuating circumstances and subject to the concurrence of both parties, all members of the Committee must be present when the Committee meets at the hearing, including any continuance of the hearing, and during all deliberations of the Committee in connection with the hearing.\n\n\nPersons Present. The persons entitled to be present at the hearing shall include:\na. the faculty member,\nb. faculty member's advisor or legal representative,\nc. Committee members,\nd. legal advisor for the Committee,\ne. representative from the University Administration, and\nf. legal representative of the University Administration.\nOther persons may be present at the discretion of the Committee. Witnesses, if any, may not be present during any portion of the hearing other than during the time they are providing testimony to the Committee, absent a compelling reason noted in writing by the Committee.\n\n\nPresiding Official. The Committee Chair shall conduct the hearing and the subsequent deliberations of the Committee.\n\n\nPre-hearing Submissions. The administration and the faculty member shall each submit to the Committee and to the other party the following items:\ni. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of the hearing, a complete list of witnesses intended to be called at the hearing, and a complete list of documents and copies of exhibits intended to be offered at the hearing. Except in extenuating circumstances, or where fairness requires, only those witnesses and exhibits listed may be called or offered at the hearing.\nii. At least seven (7) days prior to the commencement of the hearing, a statement of the case including a brief summary of the content of each witness' expected testimony, a reference to the material exhibits, a reference to any controlling legal authorities, and a summary of the factual and legal argument of the party.\niii. Such other items and documents, exhibits and other materials as the Committee might reasonably request before, during, or after the hearing.\niv. The parties shall use utmost good faith to meet the deadlines specified herein; however, the failure to meet such deadlines shall not serve as a basis for refusing to accept late submissions of materials absent substantial prejudice to the other party.\n\n\nConduct of Hearing. Only sworn or affirmed witness testimony may be accepted at the hearing. Formal rules of evidence do not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded at the discretion of the Committee.Hearsay evidence may be introduced with caution, at the discretion of the Committee, but the hearsay nature of such evidence shall be taken into account by the Committee in determining the weight to be assigned to it. The Committee may rely on its legal advisor in making any determinations on the admissibility of evidence. The Committee Chair may modify these evidentiary guidelines and the procedures for the conduct of the hearing in the interest of conducting the proceedings in a fair and timely manner.\n\n\nHearing Schedule. After consultation with the parties, a date and time for the initial hearing and any subsequent hearings shall be determined by the Committee. Normally, the hearing shall be concluded in two days or less, except in extenuating circumstances as determined by the Committee. The parties shall present their respective positions and testimony from relevant witnesses in a concise, clear and focused manner, with due regard to completion of the hearing in an efficient, fair, and timely manner.\n\n\nPresentation of Evidence.

There shall be no post-hearing submissions by either party, unless directed by the Committee. The Committee shall issue a report on the hearing to the President, with a copy to the faculty members and the appropriate Dean, within 30 days from the date of completion of the hearing, unless extenuating circumstances require otherwise. The report shall set forth the Committee's findings based on the evidence presented at the hearing and its recommendation with respect to termination for adequate cause. Where the conclusion of the Committee is not unanimous, the report must fairly reflect the minority views expressed by the members.Dissenting or concurring opinions may be included at the request of any Committee member.\n\n\n\nFinal Decision by President. The President shall be the final decision-maker in all cases considered by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure. The President shall notify the faculty member, the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure, and the appropriate Dean of his or her decision in writing. Once the President has made a final determination as to whether adequate cause for termination exists, the matter shall be closed and not subject to further review.\n\n\nFINANCIAL EXIGENCY AND PROGRAM ELIMINATION OR REVISION:\nA tenured or tenure-eligible appointment may be terminated for demonstrated financial exigency, and the affected faculty member may seek review of this termination by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure under the \"Committee Procedural Rules\" described in this AC70. Termination of a continuous appointment because of financial exigency should be demonstrably bona fide. If a tenured appointment is terminated because of financial exigency, the released faculty member's position shall not be filled by a new appointee within a period of three years from the date of actual termination unless the released faculty member first has been offered and has not accepted reappointment.\nA tenured or tenure-eligible appointment may also be terminated on the basis of program elimination or revision.Elimination on this ground may be effected only in the most extreme cases where the University demonstrates that for compelling reasons and after due academic consideration, including consultation with an appropriate Faculty Senate body, elimination or substantial revision of the program in which the faculty member's normal range of duties falls is necessary. Careful advance program and academic personnel planning, with phased adjustments over time, should operate to limit the necessity of terminating a tenured appointment in these circumstances. In the case of program elimination or substantial revision affecting a tenured faculty member's appointment, a good faith effort shall be made to continue the faculty member concerned in a comparable capacity with the University in any of its campuses, based upon the individual's competencies and the capabilities of the University.\nA tenured faculty member terminated for reasons of program elimination or revision shall receive one year's notification prior to the date of the impending termination and may seek review of this termination by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure under the \"Committee Procedural Rules\" described in this AC70. If a tenured appointment is terminated because of elimination or substantial revision, the released faculty member's position shall not be filled by a new appointee within a period of three years from the date of actual termination unless the released faculty member first has been offered and has not accepted reappointment.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAC23\u00a0Promotion and Tenure Procedures and Regulations\nAC76\u00a0Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy is written to define the conditions and procedures under which tenured faculty members, or tenure eligible faculty members against whom \"out of time\" dismissal is sought, may be dismissed from the University on grounds of adequate cause, financial exigency, or program elimination or revision."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy22","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated External Defibrillators (AED) | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesAutomated External Defibrillators (AED) \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY22\nAutomated External Defibrillators (AED)\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nReference\nDefinitions\nPolicy\nResponsibilities\nProcedures\nPurchase\/Obtain or Use of AEDs by University Work Units\nContents of \"Work Unit Plan to Use AED Unit(s)\"\nMaintenance and Inspection Requirements for AEDs\nTraining Requirements\nAdditional Items to be Placed with AEDs\nPost Incident Reporting Procedures\nExceptions\nFurther Information\n\n\n\nREFERENCE:\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8331.2 specifies Good Samaritan civil immunity for use of automated external defibrillators and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8332 specifies nonmedical Good Samaritan civil immunity.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates AED units as medical devices.

These threats, by necessity, require the immediate initiation of procedures to ensure the safety of the occupants of the threatened facility. While a threat may be made by an individual against a department or a building for any number of personal reasons, these threats must be presumed to be valid.\nRECEIPT OF THREAT:\nA threat may be received by telephone, e-mail, mail, or in person. Threats may be directed to a public safety agency (police or fire), a telephone switchboard operator, the building or department directly affected by the threat, or through a third uninvolved person.\nRegardless of which method is used, the following information should be gathered by the person receiving the threat, regardless of how the threat is communicated.\nRecord the exact information given in the threat, the exact words used by the person, whether in person or by telephone.\nA description of the person making the threat, or of their voice which may be characteristic of a sex, race, or age, with special attention being given to words and terms used.\nIf the threat is made by telephone, listen for background noises which may indicate from where the call is originating. Immediately relay the information to the appropriate police, security or business office, giving your name, location, where you can be contacted, and the exact words used by the caller, as well as the time the call was received.\nThreats received by an outside agency and relayed to University personnel, should be immediately forwarded to the University Police for further investigation.\nEVACUATION OF BUILDING:\nIf the building is to be evacuated, the evacuation alarm (commonly referred to as the \"fire\" alarm) may be sounded. The evacuation announcement may be delivered in person by public safety personnel or other means if available. If an evacuation is deemed necessary, all persons in the building will then be expected to leave. Personnel from police or security, or other appropriate persons, will be assigned to prohibit entry or re-entry until the building has been searched and\/or a given time period has elapsed. In some cases, sheltering in place may be appropriate. Occupants shall await guidance from public safety personnel.\nPOLICE, SECURITY OR OTHER OFFICES:\nUpon receipt of the information of a bomb threat, police, security or business office personnel will set into motion procedures to notify appropriate emergency personnel and the persons in the affected building to ensure their safety. At University Park, the following situations will apply:\nIf the threat is deemed to be imminent or credible, the University Police Officer in Charge may authorize the immediate evacuation of a building or area in the interest of public safety.\nFor all other threats, the University Police dispatcher will immediately notify the Assistant Vice President for Police and Public Safety or his\/her designee and the Chief of Police or his\/her designee.\nThe Assistant Vice President for Police and Public Safety will notify the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business or his\/her designee.\nThe Assistant Vice President for Police and Public Safety will consult with the dean of the college, administrative office, director or business officer of the affected area in regards to the decision making process of whether or not to evacuate the building.\nThe Assistant Vice President for Police and Public Safety will also notify the Vice President for Strategic Communications and\/or the Director of Public Information.\nAt Non-University Park locations, security or the business office will notify emergency organizations, i.e., police, fire, medical. The Chancellor or designee, in consultation with the Director of Business Services and\/or security, will determine whether the building is to be posted or evacuated.\nSEARCH OF PRIVATE OFFICES OR AREAS BY BUILDING OCCUPANTS:\nIn case of an evacuation, time spent by police, security or other appropriate personnel in searching the threatened facility can be reduced by cooperation of the occupants of private offices and areas as follows:\nPrior to evacuating, please take all personal items that you would immediately need during an evacuation. This would include purses, bags, medications, laptop computers etc.\nIf any unusual items are observed, immediately leave the room. DO NOT TOUCH the item and advise the nearest uniformed officer as you exit the building.\nRestrict the use of cellular phone or any radios until you have exited the building.\nTHREATS DURING PUBLIC EVENTS:\nDuring public events or gatherings, the same procedure will be utilized; however, a prepared statement will be given to the announcer, the master of ceremonies, or building management to read to those in attendance.\nPERSONNEL PROCEDURES DURING BOMB THREATS:\nIn the event that a bomb threat is made to a University building, the decision will be made for the building to remain open or be evacuated. Occupants will be made aware of this decision as follows:\nIF THE BUILDING REMAINS OPEN:\nIf the building is to be kept open, notices indicating the bomb threat will be placed on the entrance doors, and each office, classroom, or other work area will be notified. In such a case, an employee may be assigned to another work location. If not reassigned, the employee will have the option to remain at his or her regular work location, or to leave the building for the period of the bomb threat and be paid for regular work time missed during this period.\nWhen the bomb threat notices are removed from the entrance doors of the building, the employee assigned to another work location is asked to return to his or her building, or the employee who exercised the option to leave during the bomb threat period has a further option to return to the building or remain absent and charge the absence to vacation, personal holiday, or a pay deduction.\nIF THE BUILDING IS EVACUATED:\nIf the building is to be evacuated, the occupants of the building will leave immediately. The evacuation distance will be at a minimum 300 feet or the distance of a football field, away from the building or affected area. After a period of two hours, it is the responsibility of the dean, administrative officer, or responsible person to call University Police, security or the business office for further instructions concerning occupancy of the building.\nIt is also the responsibility of the dean or administrative officer to see that all employees are properly instructed concerning:\nImmediate evacuation of the building when the evacuation alarm is sounded.\nProceeding quickly to a safe distance from the building.\nWhere and when to report to receive instruction for returning to the building.\nNormal operations will be resumed when the building is again made available for occupancy. If an employee had not been assigned to another work location and chooses not to return to the original building, he or she will be required to charge the absent time to vacation, personal holiday, or as a pay deduction.\nAn employee will be paid for any work time missed while the building has been closed. The employee may, however, be assigned to another work location.\nAn employee who has been assigned to another work location may continue at that location or may be requested to return to the original building. Any employee who elects not to return to his or her own building will be required to charge the absent time to vacation, personal holiday or as a pay deduction.\nCLOSING BUILDING WITHIN LAST 2-1\/2 HOURS OF AN EMPLOYEE'S WORK SCHEDULE:\nIf the building is vacated within 2-1\/2 hours of the end of an employee's work day, the employee shall not be expected to return to that building for the balance of the work day. An employee may be assigned to another work location by his or her supervisor. If not, the employee will not lose vacation time or pay.\nINSURANCE COVERAGE:\nUniversity insurance coverage, including Workman's Compensation, continues in effect for an employee while he is working in a building for which a bomb threat has been received.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Assistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety.\nEffective Date: June 10, 2014\n\tDate Approved: June 4, 2014\n\tDate Published: June 10, 2014\nMost recent changes:\nJune 10, 2014 - To clarify current operations, the following sections have been updated: RECEIPT OF THREAT, EVACUATION OF BUILDING, POLICE, SECURITY OR OTHER OFFICES, SEARCH OF PRIVATE OFFICES OR AREAS BY BUILDING OCCUPANTS, and IF THE BUILDING IS EVACUATED.

This excludes areas that currently are not heated or cooled and areas with special environmental needs.\nThe temperature during low occupancy or unoccupied periods in all University facilities will be allowed to cool down to 60 degrees in the winter and warm up to 85 degrees in the summer. This excludes areas that currently are not heated or cooled and areas with special environmental needs.\nEmployees and students with manual control of the equipment that heats or cools their space shall operate the equipment so that the least amount of energy is consumed (example, operate window air conditioning units only when the spaces are occupied).\nEvery effort will be made to improve the utilization of our buildings by consolidating activities from lower utilized buildings into higher utilized buildings. This will allow building heating, ventilating and air conditioning system run times to be reduced, resulting in energy savings.\nOnly Office of Physical Plant (OPP) or Housing and Food Service (HFS) issued portable electric heaters are permitted at University Park. Portable electric heater use at locations away from University Park must be approved by the campus budget executive, or designee, on a case by case basis.\nComputers\nComputer power management software shall be enabled to minimize the operation and consumption of electricity when computers are not in use.

If there is a need for longer service, beyond a temporary need, this should be reflected in changes to permanent budgets and\/or reallocations of staff time and effort. In no case should a budget executive approve supplemental compensation for work that is part of the exempt employee's job responsibilities.\nGUIDELINES:\nThe following general guidelines will apply:\nThe duties to be performed should be clearly differentiated from the types of duties the individual normally performs.\nNormally, the additional duties should not be performed on a continuing basis.\nNormally, the work should not be performed during the regular work schedule of the individual, nor should it in any way impair the ability of the staff member to carry out his or her regular responsibilities.\nIf the additional duties performed are teaching duties, no more than two 3-credit courses (or their equivalent) should be taught in a fiscal year.\nNormally, the work should not be performed for the budget executive for whom the staff member regularly works.\nA staff member's participation in a project that involves extra compensation from another University fiscal unit must have prior approval for the participation and the amount of extra compensation from the staff member's budget executive. In no case should the Supplemental II compensation being paid in total for a fiscal year exceed 20% of the exempt employee's base salary, unless approved in advance by the staff member's budget executive.\nMETHOD OF PAY:\nFor all extra assignments, an electronic Supplementary Compensation form (SUPP) is used to initiate and process compensation payments for Supplementary I and Supplementary II appointments. The SUPP form must be appropriately routed to the employee's home budget area for review and approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the procedure and establish guidelines for determining circumstances under which extra compensation is payable to exempt staff employees for extra noncontinuous assignments.NOTE: This policy is not utilized for determining compensation when an individual is appointed in an \"acting\" capacity."},{"university":"psu","name":"rag22","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for Participant Support Costs | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesGuidelines for Participant Support Costs \n\n\n\nResearch Administration Guidelines\n\nRAG22\nGuidelines for Participant Support Costs\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Research, and Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nWho Is A Participant?\nWho Is Not A Participant?\nWho May Be A Participant?\nParticipant Support Costs\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nWHO IS A PARTICIPANT?\nA participant is an individual who is receiving a service or training opportunity from a workshop, conference, seminar, symposium or other short-term instructional or information sharing activity funded by a sponsored award. A participant may be a Penn State student\/scholar, a student\/scholar from another institution, a private sector company representative, a K-12 teacher, or a state or local government agency personnel. A participant may be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or foreign national. The participant must have a Social Security Number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).\nA participant does not perform work or services for the project or program other than for their own benefit. The participant is not required to deliver anything or provide any service to the university in return for these support costs.\nWHO IS NOT A PARTICIPANT?\nPenn State faculty or staff members cannot be participants.\nProfessional or keynote presenters whose only role in attending is as a presenter.\nNOTE:\u00a0 Individuals attending a conference who may also present a session on their research findings as a secondary role could still be considered participants if appropriately documented.\nResearch subjects receiving incentive payments to participate in studies are not participants for the purposes of this policy.\nWHO MAY BE A PARTICIPANT?\nPost-doctorates and graduate assistants serve in a dual role at the University.\u00a0 These individuals are eligible to be participants unless they have a role in organizing the event or forwarding the project\u2019s aims and are receiving compensation directly or indirectly from the grant.\nStudent wage employees, including graduate assistants receiving bridge funding over the summer through wage or Fixed-Term 2 appointments, are participants only if they are strictly attending the workshop for training purposes.\nThe determination of participant status relates to their primary role \u2013 student or employee\/graduate assistant.\u00a0 For a project where post-doctorates or graduate assistants or wage payroll students of the University are helping to manage the logistical\/administrative details of a sponsored conference or training project, such work would be considered part of their appointment duties and therefore their time and\/or travel expenses should be paid for by another appropriate funding source. They should not receive participant support funds on top of that. Conversely, if a post-doctorate, graduate assistant or student wage employee is attending a conference specifically for the purpose of receiving training, those costs generally may be included as participant support costs.\nPARTICIPANT SUPPORT COSTS:\nParticipant support costs are direct costs for items such as participant allowance, supplies, per diem, travel expenses, and\/or registration fees paid to or on behalf of a participant in connection with a meeting, workshop, conference, symposium or training project conducted under the award. Amounts must be reasonable, based on type and duration of the activity, and outlined in the program solicitation.\nParticipant support costs may include the following expenses:\nPenn State tuition and registration fees if required to participate in the project\nEvent registration fees\nStipend (predetermined amount regardless of actual costs) for housing and subsistence allowance\nTravel costs when the sole purpose of the trip is to participate in the project activity\nEvent support costs for lodging and meal expenses paid directly to the event facility, only if the payment is made on behalf of, or reimbursed directly to, the participant\nMeals and incidentals when on travel status\nTraining materials\nLab supplies\nGenerally, travel costs are reimbursed to participants through ERS.\u00a0 Travel allowances may be permitted (a set amount for each participant regardless of actual costs incurred by the participant), but must be proposed in the award \u2013 both narrative and budget \u2013 to assure approval by the sponsoring agency.\u00a0 If a department will be incurring substantial administrative costs due to the cost of processing ERS travel reimbursements for participants, administrative time may be permitted as a direct cost on the non-participant portion of the award.\nAll costs that are reimbursed or paid on behalf of the participant must be incurred within the project period and be specifically allowed by the sponsoring agency. Participant support costs are budgeted in a separate line and must be accounted for separately in a separate account. Funds provided for participant support costs that are not spent cannot be rebudgeted for use in other categories except with the prior written approval of the sponsor. In most cases, unspent participant costs must be returned to the sponsor.\nThe following expenses, except when specifically allowed by the award, should not be processed as participant support costs:\nTravel for project PI or staff\nMultipurpose travel (i.e., to perform research in addition to attending a project related meeting)\nTravel for a consultant who is providing service to the university\nEvent support cost (e.g, facility rentals, media equipment rentals, food\/refreshments) not made on behalf of or paid to participants\nEntertainment\/food for nonparticipants\nHonoraria paid to a guest speaker or lecturer\nIncentive payment to encourage an individual to participate as a research subject\nSubaward to a provider for multiple training events (i.e., an ongoing contract with specific terms and conditions)\nPayments to a participant\u2019s employer to reimburse the costs related to sending the employee to the project event\nExpenses related to meetings of an administrative nature\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nRA22 - Participant Support Costs\nEffective Date: March 10, 2017\n\tDate Approved: March 9, 2017\n\tPublished Date: March 10, 2017\nMost recent changes:\n\u00a0\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMarch 10, 2017 - New guideline, created to provide additional guidance regarding participant support costs discussed in Policy RA22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This guideline provides additional guidance regarding participant support costs per Policy RA22."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad72","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Suspected Child Abuse | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesReporting Suspected Child Abuse \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD72\nReporting Suspected Child Abuse\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nScope\nDefinitions\nPolicy\nFurther Information\nCross References\nAttachment A - Reporting Suspected Child Abuse FAQs\n\n\nSCOPE:\nThis policy applies to all Penn State University locations and to all University employees, volunteers, and independent contractors.\u00a0 The Penn State Hershey Medical Center campus (including the College of Medicine) will follow a separate policy that complies with the principles of this policy, but reflects its unique activities.\nDEFINITIONS:\nAdult \u2013 An individual 18 years of age or older.\u00a0 (23 Pa.

C.S.\u00a76303(a)).\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of Penn State University to require all University employees, volunteers, and independent contractors who in the course of their business or volunteer activity, have reasonable suspicion of child abuse, as defined by the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, to make a report as outlined in this policy. This does not include any confidential communications made to an attorney subject to the attorney-client privilege or a member of the clergy subject to the clergy-penitent privilege.\nBasis to Report\nUnder this policy, ALL University employees, volunteers and independent contractors, regardless of their status as a mandated reporter as defined by Pennsylvania law, who, in the course of their business or volunteer activity, have reasonable suspicion of child abuse, as defined by Pennsylvania law, are to make a report as outlined in this policy. In addition, ALL University employees, volunteers and independent contractors, who, in the course of their business or volunteer activity, receive a specific disclosure from a person that an identifiable child is a victim of child abuse, or that the person has abused a child, are also required to make a report as outlined in this policy. Please note that information learned through any confidential communications made to an attorney subject to the attorney-client privilege or to a member of the clergy subject to the clergy-penitent privilege is not required to be reported.\nPursuant to the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, any University employee, volunteer. and\/or\u00a0independent contractor, who is defined by law as a mandated reporter, must make a report if there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is a victim of child abuse under any of the following circumstances (23 Pa. C.S.\u00a76311(b)):\nThe mandated reporter comes into contact with the child in the course of employment, occupation and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled program, activity or service.\nThe mandated reporter is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of the child, or is affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, regularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of the child.\nA person makes a specific disclosure to the mandated reporter that an identifiable child is the victim of child abuse.\nAn individual 14 years of age or older makes a specific disclosure to the mandated reporter that the individual has committed child abuse.\nHow to Make a Report\nIf you are making a report as a mandated reporter pursuant to Pennsylvania law or as a University employee, independent contractor, or volunteer (or both), follow these steps:\nIf a child is in immediate danger, contact police at 911 to obtain immediate protection for the child.\nImmediately make an oral report to the Pennsylvania Department of Human services via ChildLine (1-800-932-0313) (23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6313(a) (1)) or an electronic report using the Child Welfare Portal at www.compass.state.pa.us\/cwis.\u00a0 Solely informing a supervisor that you suspect abuse is NOT sufficient under this Policy or the law.\nImmediately, but in no event later than 48 hours after calling ChildLine (as described in #2 above), prepare and submit a written report utilizing Form CY47, which may be submitted electronically, to the County Children and Youth agency where the suspected abuse occurred (23 Pa. C.S. \u00a76313(a)(2)).\u00a0 If you make an electronic report using the Child Welfare Portal (as described in #2 above), you are not required to submit a Form CY47 to the County Children and Youth Agency.\nWhenever an employee, volunteer or independent contractor makes a report, that person shall also make an internal report to the University\u2019s designated agents for purposes of this policy and Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, pursuant to (23 Pa. C.S.\u00a76311(c)) by immediately sending an email to AD72@psu.edu, attaching the completed Form CY47 (if required, as described in #3 above).\u00a0 In response to the email, the person making the report will be contacted by University Police Services, Penn State\u2019s Office of Ethics & Compliance, and\/or Penn State\u2019s Risk Management Office. All University employees, volunteers, and independent contractors are required to assist the University, to the extent deemed necessary by the University, in gathering factual information related to the report.\nForward any subsequent communication from the Department of Human Services relating to the report to AD72@psu.edu.\nTo the extent provided by law, Penn State will preserve the confidentiality of all child abuse and neglect reports and records to protect the privacy rights of the person making the report. (23 Pa. C.S. \u00a76340).\nImmunity from Liability\nUnder the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, a person acting in good faith who makes a report of child abuse, whether required to report or not, has immunity from civil and criminal liability. (23 Pa. C.S. \u00a76318(a)).\nFailure to Report\nPursuant to Pennsylvania law, a mandated reporter who willfully fails to report a case of suspected child abuse or to make a referral to the appropriate authorities commits an offense up to the level of a felony of the third degree. (23 Pa. C.S. \u00a76319).\nPursuant to University policy, if any University employee, volunteer, or independent contractor negligently, recklessly, or willfully fails to report a case of suspected child abuse, then that individual is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\nProtection from Employment Discrimination\nThe Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law provides protection from employment discrimination when a person has acted in good faith in making a report of suspected child abuse. (23 Pa. C.S. \u00a76320(a)).\nUniversity Policy AD67, Disclosure of Wrongful Conduct and Protection from Retaliation, encourages and enables any member of the University faculty, staff, or student body to make Good Faith Reports of suspected Wrongful Conduct, and to protect such individuals from Retaliation for making such reports to the University or an Appropriate Authority, participating in any investigation, hearing, or inquiry by the University or an Appropriate Authority or participating in a court proceeding relating to an allegation of suspected Wrongful Conduct at the University.\nEducation & Training\nPenn State University will make educational communications and programs available to employees, volunteers, and independent contractors aimed at the prevention of child abuse and neglect, the recognition of the signs and symptoms of child abuse and neglect, and reporting requirements and procedures.\nInitial Training RequirementsAll University employees, volunteers, and\/or independent contractors who are interacting with minors in a youth program, activity or service must complete the Building a Safe Penn State: Reporting Child Abuse training prior to working within the program, activity or service.\nAll other University employees will be required to complete the Building a Safe Penn State: Reporting Child Abuse training within the first 30 days of employment.\nIn addition to Section A above, Penn State employees who are considered Professional Licensees are required to follow additional requirements as outlined in 23 Pa.

The support monies will be used for such purposes as salary supplementation, graduate assistant stipends, secretarial assistance, and\u00a0travel expenses, etc. By supporting the establishment of a University-named deanship, the benefactor directs attention to a continuing commitment to support scholarship within the University.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR APPOINTMENT:\nAppointments will be made by the President of the University, subject to the approval by the Board of Trustees.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS:\nFunds for a University-named deanship are provided by gifts or designated University funds appropriated for this purpose. To establish such a position, an endowment of not less than $5,000,000 is required and the income therefrom, to the extent necessary, shall be used to maintain the deanship in perpetuity. Alternatively, a University deanship may be established for a fixed period of time by an expendable grant of not less than 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year for a minimum of 5 years.\nEARLY ACTIVATION:\nIn certain cases, the agreement reached with a major donor regarding the support of a University-named deanship may specify that the University will not receive the endowment funding for several years. So that the donor may begin seeing the results of the gift at an earlier time, consideration will be given to the possibility of immediately activating the deanship.\nProposals for the early establishment of University-named deanships will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. The following general guidelines will apply:\nThe agreement reached with the donor must be of an irrevocable nature -- charitable remainder trust, charitable gift annuity, estate note, etc.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where approval has been received, the donor must commit through a multi-year pledge of 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year until the endowment income becomes available. A term of at least five years is preferred.\n\t\t\u00a0\nActivation of a deanship annual gifts will require that all parties be informed that funding of the deanship will continue as long as resources are available.\n\nTITLE CONTINUATION INTO EMERITUS RANK:\nAn individual eligible for emeritus rank holding a University-Named Title will continue such title designation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the University's policy on University-named dean's chairs."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr08","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishment of a Staff or Technical-Service Position | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesEstablishment of a Staff or Technical-Service Position \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR08\nEstablishment of a Staff or Technical-Service Position\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: July 1, 1965\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: January 31, 2008\nContents:\nPurpose\nInformation to be Provided\nResponsibility of the Office of Human Resources\n\n\nINFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED:\nThe dean or administrative officer shall provide information about the new position to either the Employment and Compensation Division (for staff jobs), or the Employee Relations Division (for technical-service jobs) of the Office of Human Resources.\nRESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFICE OF HUMAN RESOURCES:\nThe Employment and Compensation Division has the responsibility to\n\t(a) determine proper classification for staff jobs under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and\n\t(b) determine the proper salary range for such positions.\nThe Employee Relations Division has the responsibility to\n\t(a) determine the proper classification and evaluation for technical-service jobs.\nAll positions established, whether on newly approved budgets or established through budgetary reallocations authorized by a dean or administrative office, have only tentative approval subject to review by the Office of Human Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy outlines the procedure to be followed when a staff or technical-service position is to be established."},{"university":"psu","name":"ac85","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliate Academic Appointments | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesAffiliate Academic Appointments \n\n\n\nAcademic Policies\n\nAC85\nAffiliate Academic Appointments                (Formerly  HR85)\n\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice Provost for Faculty Affairs>\n\u00a0\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: February 28, 1975\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: February 3, 2006\nPurpose\nEligibility\nTitle to be Used\nApproval and Appointment\nTenure Eligibility\nReview\nRemuneration\n\n\nELIGIBILITY:\nIndividuals apparently qualified for a regular academic appointment whose primary responsibilities are other than academic and for whom such status is recommended by the appropriate dean.\nTITLE TO BE USED:\nAcademic appointments authorized under this policy are to be designed as follows:\nAffiliate Professor\n\t\t\u00a0\nAffiliate Associate Professor\n\t\t\u00a0\nAffiliate Assistant Professor\n\t\t\u00a0\nAffiliate Instructor\nAPPROVAL AND APPOINTMENT:\nAppointment to an affiliate faculty rank is made in an academic department, and must have the approval of the Department Head and the CollegeDean;

Inevitably, many lost personal belongings are discovered on University property and are submitted to the University in anticipation that the owners will claim the items. This policy provides guidance for the handling of items in these situations.\nThere are certain issues that employees must be cognizant of, and certain obligations that must be fulfilled with respect to lost and found items. For purposes of this policy and all related procedures, \"employee\" also includes, but is not limited to, student employees, graduate assistants, volunteers and third-party employees such as contractors and consultants.\nThis policy and related procedures apply to all lost items found on University-owned or leased property.\nFINDING AND HANDLING LOST ITEMS:\nItems will be considered to be lost when found in an area where items are not normally left for a period of time, or after the building is closed to the general public. Facilities with 24-hour operations will determine a local policy for determining when items will be considered lost for purposes of this policy. If an item is found which may be stolen or contraband, University Police or Security offices must be contacted immediately\nEach college, campus and administrative unit must designate an office that will handle lost and found items and will be considered a lost and found repository. Click here for a list of repositories.\nIt shall be the responsibility of each repository to safeguard lost items, participate in efforts to return items to the owners,\u00a0and to forward items unclaimed after specified periods of time as outlined in Procedure AD2001. The University will take reasonable efforts to return items to the rightful owner, but assumes no liability if an item is returned to the wrong individual or if an item placed in a repository is mislabeled, misplaced, or damaged.\nEmployees of the University must turn in all lost items found, either to a supervisor or directly to a lost and found repository. Other individuals who find lost items are encouraged to turn them into the closest University Office, or to the University Police or Campus Security Office (as applicable).\nRECOVERING OR CLAIMING LOST ITEMS:\nOwners trying to find lost items should contact the nearest\u00a0repository\u00a0located where they believe that their item was lost, and inquire about the item. If this is not possible, the owners may contact the University Police or Campus Security office, describing the lost item and the location where they suspect the item was lost.\nFinder's claims may be honored if the finder provides contact information to the office to which the items are turned in, and completes the Lost and Found Finder Claim Form\u00a0indicating they wish to maintain their rights as finders. Certain items (e.g., checks, credit cards, driver's license, passports and other items with personally identifiable information) are not subject to finder's claims. Electronic devices must be sanitized before being returned under a finder's claim.\u00a0 Employees may not claim items found while performing their job or at their primary work location.\nItems which are unclaimed by the owner, finder or which are not subject to finder's claims will be processed according to the procedures outlined in Procedure\u00a0AD2001.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nProcedure AD2001 shall provide specific details regarding the handling of lost and found items and operation of lost and found repositories.\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 19, 2016 - Major revisions to the policy, providing additional guidance to repositories for the handling, storage and final disposition of lost and found items throughout the University.\nRevision History (and effective dates) :\nNovember 1, 2002 - New Policy.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nFebruary 15, 2016>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nFebruary 19, 2016>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nFebruary 19, 2016>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy is intended to provide a standardized, efficient and controlled process for the handling, storage and final disposition of lost and found items throughout the University."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy14","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of Radioactive Materials | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesUse of Radioactive Materials \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY14\nUse of Radioactive Materials\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nReference\nDefinitions\nApplicability\nPolicy\nResponsibilities\nVice-President for Research \nOffice of Environmental Health and Safety\nRadiation Safety Officer\nUniversity Isotopes Committee\nOffice for Research Protections\nPrincipal Investigators (Supervisors)\nIndividual Users\n\nTraining\nAcquisition, Storage, Transfer, and Disposal of Radioactive Material\nUse of Radioactive Material\nEmergencies\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nREFERENCE:\nThe ownership and use of a radioactive material is governed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Radiation Protection (DEP) and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). DEP requirements can be found in Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code Article V.Radiological Health, and NRC requirements can be found in applicable parts of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations of the U. S. Departments of Transportation, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency also apply.\nPenn State's University Isotopes Committee (UIC) has approved the Rules and Procedures for Users of Radioactive Material at the Pennsylvania State University. These Rules and Procedures are available by contacting the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) or at the EHS website.\nDEFINITIONS:\nRadioactive material as used in this policy includes:\nSpecifically licensed material: Radioactive material that may be used by a specific legal entity for a specific purpose. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania grant the University permission to use this material. This permission comes with many very specific restrictions. Examples of this material include all radioactive material used in molecular biology labs, gauges, irradiators and the material produced at the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor. At Penn State, natural uranium and thorium compounds (acetates, nitrates, and oxides) are included in this category.\nGenerally licensed material: Radioactive material contained in a device manufactured for a particular purpose. General licenses are issued (in effect) to Penn State when an item containing radioactive material is sold to Penn State. These licenses have fewer, but still important, restrictions. Examples of this material include certain specific devices such as some gas chromatographs, self-luminescent exit signs, and liquid scintillation counters.\nLicense exempt material: Radioactive materials considered too small to be hazardous -- as long as the material is used as intended. Examples of this material include low activity check sources, standards for radiation detection equipment, smoke detectors, natural radioactive materials in ceramics, and natural ores and minerals below specific uranium and thorium concentrations.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy applies to possession and use of all radioactive material at all Penn State University locations except the Hershey Medical Center and the radioactive material produced at the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor and retained under the control of that specific reactor license.\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of Penn State University that the release of radioactive material and the exposure of people to ionizing radiation be kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). To achieve this goal, all users of radioactive material shall comply with the Rules and Procedures for Users of Radioactive Material at The Pennsylvania State University. Penn State's University Isotopes Committee established these rules to aid compliance with federal and state regulations.\nAll supervisors of laboratories that will use specifically licensed radioactive material are required to obtain approval from the UIC prior to obtaining the material. The application may be acquired by contacting Environmental Health and Safety or at the EHS website.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nVice President for Research\nThe Vice President for Research is the senior University official responsible to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for compliance with specific radioactive material licenses issued to the University. The Vice President for Research appoints the University Isotope Committee to perform those functions required of the licenses, and delegates to the UIC the authority and responsibility to review all requests for the use of radioactive materials, and to approve, deny, or revoke such authorizations\nOffice of Environmental Health and Safety\nThe office of Environmental Health and Safety administers the University's health and safety programs and is responsible for implementing the radiation safety program to ensure protection of people and the environment, as well as regulatory compliance. EHS assists users of radioactive material in developing safe research programs and procedures, maintains surveillance of all activities involving licensed radioactive material, and enforces compliance with rules and regulations, license conditions, and the conditions of project approvals authorized by the University Isotopes Committee.\nIn addition, EHS is responsible to:\nReceive and ship all radioactive material arriving at or leaving the University\nInstruct personnel in radiation safety prior to their use of radioactive material\nManage the proper disposal of radioactive waste\nMaintain the inventory of specifically licensed radioactive material\nTrack and control the use of generally licensed radioactive material\nRadiation Safety Officer\nThe Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), as a member of EHS, is responsible for assuring that all radioactive materials at Penn State locations are used in accordance with good health physics practices, applicable regulations, and this policy. The RSO has the duty to interrupt and report to the UIC any isotope operation in which health and safety may be compromised and any operation that may result in non-compliance with University regulations.The RSO is responsible for performing those duties required by federal and state regulations.\nUniversity Isotopes Committee\nThe University Isotopes Committee is responsible for the administration of specific licenses issued to the University for the use of radioactive materials and insuring that such licensed use meets federal, state,and University regulations. In addition the UIC evaluates procedures, and approves, denies, or rescinds, individual University isotope authorizations.The Committee meets on a quarterly basis to address the University's radioactive material status.\nOffice for Research Protections\nThe Office for Research Protections facilitates the review process for research protocols involving the use of radioisotopes. It is responsible for administrating the activities of the University Isotope Committee with emphasis on implementation of committee decisions, enforcement of UIC sanctions, and the coordination of protocol reviews. The office also monitors UIC membership and maintains complete and accurate records of UIC activities.\nPrincipal Investigators (Supervisors)\nPrincipal investigators are required to obtain prior approval from the University Isotopes Committee for authorization to use specifically licensed radioactive material. Each supervisor is responsible for all activities involving radioactive material under his or her jurisdiction. The supervisor is responsible for properly training his or her staff in accordance with this policy, and for ensuring compliance with this policy and the terms of the authorization approved by the UIC. In addition, all Principal Investigators authorized to possess radioactive material are responsible to pay Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection license fees for the use of radioactive materials. Procedures for payment are established through EHS.\nTo obtain approval from the UIC, the principal investigator must submit the Request for Authorization to Use Radioactive Material, which is available at the EHS web sitE. No one may supervise the use of radioactive material without approval by the UIC. Normally only faculty members are approved to supervise radioactive material laboratories, however the UIC may make exceptions to this policy.\nPrincipal investigators are required to register all generally licensed radioactive material with EHS. The Generally Licensed Radioactive Material Registration Form is available at the EHS website. No one may use generally licensed radioactive material until the material is registered with EHS.\nIndividual Users\nEach individual user, including each supervisor, is ultimately responsible for the safe use of all radioactive material to which he or she has access. Users must obtain training from EHS and must pass the exam at the end of this training. Each individual must perform all work according to the scope and limits of the Authorization to Use Radioactive Material. Each individuals hall read, be familiar with, and comply with all sections of the Rules and Procedures applicable to his or her work.\nTRAINING:\nFaculty or staff who supervise students or staff who work with specifically licensed radioactive material must have an authorization for the use of that material approved by the UIC. Faculty must have experience working with radioactive material before they can be approved to supervise a laboratory. This experience is required so supervisors understand the difficulties and restrictions inherent in working with radioactive material.The UIC will arrange to provide the necessary training and experience for those who need hands-on experience.\nSupervisors and users of specifically licensed radioactive material must meet minimal training requirements as specified in the Rules and Procedures.These include the initial training required prior to beginning work with radioactive material, annual retraining, and any special training required by the UIC.\nPersons who do not work with radioactive material but work in areas in which radioactive material is used (dish washers, administrative assistants, janitors) shall review Radiation Safety for Ancillary Personnel. This pamphlet can be obtained from the EHS office or from the EHS web site. It is the responsibility of the supervisors of such workers to see that each individual has reviewed and understood the material in this publication.\nRegistrants of generally licensed sources will be given individual training concerning the requirements of the particular source(s). Personnel who work in the area of generally licensed sources should review the Radiation Safety for Ancillary Personnel information on the EHS web site.\nACQUISITION, STORAGE, TRANSFER, AND DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL:\nAll acquisition and transfer of specifically licensed radioactive material must receive prior approval from Environmental Health and Safety. All radioactive material must be delivered to 228 Academic Projects Building. EHS staff will ensure that the material is obtained, documented, and surveyed in accordance with applicable regulations.\nRadioactive material falls into many different categories (source material, by-product material, naturally occurring radioactive material, accelerator produced material, generally licensed, specifically licensed, and four kinds of exempt material).

The results of the biennial review will be documented.\nUpon request, the University shall make available to the public the information it distributes on annual basis, as well as make its biennial review available when completed.\nRECORDS RETENTION:\nThe University shall retain for a period of three years following their distribution:\u00a0 (1) copies of the information distributed to employees and students on an annual basis; (2) the biennial review report; (3) those records documenting distribution; and (4) any other records reasonably related to the University\u2019s compliance with the drug prevention program certification.\u00a0 If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, review, or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the three-year period, the University shall retain the records until completion of the action and resolution of all issues that arise from it, or until the end of the regular three-year period, whichever is later.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of General Counsel.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther policies and procedures should be cross referenced, particularly:\nAD18 - Possession, Use and Distribution of Alcoholic Beverages\nAD33 - A Drug-Free Workplace\nAD35 - University Archives and Records Management\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMay 6, 2014 - New policy.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nMay 5, 2014>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nMay 6, 2014>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nMay 6, 2014>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish the parameters for compliance with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 which added section 1213 to the Higher Education Act (commonly referred to as the \u201cDFSCA\u201d) at all University locations."},{"university":"psu","name":"fn11","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContracts and Leases  | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesContracts and Leases  \n\n\n\nFinancial Policies\n\nFN11\nContracts and Leases \nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nOffice of the Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nScope and Authority\nLimited Delegation of Signature Authority\nFurther Information\n\n\nSCOPE AND AUTHORITY:\nExcept as stated under LIMITED DELEGATION OF SIGNATURE AUTHORITY below, all contractual documents, must be signed by one of the following University officials as authorized by the Board of Trustees to contractually bind the University:\nPresident, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer (Board Officers), and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business, and the Corporate Controller (University Officers).

Security requirements for credit card data are strict and if not enforced, can result in significant monetary fines as well as damage to the reputation of the unit and the University. The Budget Executive in the unit must approve the establishment of all merchant accounts and related terminal IDs within their area of responsibility. Prior to approval, the Budget Executive must consider technical, financial and administrative issues and costs arising from the acceptance of credit cards versus the business need for accepting such payments.\nAll revenues received through electronic payments must be for the benefit of Penn State and should be processed as outlined in FN01. Penn State University does not permit the acceptance of electronic payments on websites which are hosted on Penn State computers and served by Penn State networks or servers, including PSU-provided personal webspace, unless the area has an approved merchant account. If an individual has the need to accept electronic payments on PSU-provided personal webspace (for example, in support of an academic journal), payment processing should be managed through Penn State\u2019s eCommerce solutions. The individual may not collect or store electronic payment information through the personal website which is part of the Penn State network. In no case may electronic payments, even through third-party vendors, be accepted for any commercial enterprise which results in personal gain to the individual involved as outlined in policy AD20.\nThe University has a responsibility to its customers to protect credit card information, as well as to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). The only credit card data that can be retained, on paper or electronically, is the last 4 digits of the card number, the expiration date and the card type. Other credit card data, including the full card number, CVC2\/CVV2\/CID data, PIN\/PIN block and track data from the full magnetic stripe, cannot be stored, post authorization. This applies to all University systems, including the AIS eCommerce server, any University servers used or hosted by a third-party, as well as locally maintained systems, including databases, spreadsheets, email, imaging systems, and paper files. Exceptions must be specifically approved by the Corporate Controller.\nThe University also has a responsibility to protect any other payment information that may be personally-identifying information, as covered in policy FN23.\nCREDIT CARD PROCESSING:\n MERCHANT RESPONSIBILITIES:\nAll University units with merchant accounts, including all terminal IDs tied to a merchant account, are responsible for the following:\nCompliance with all merchant rules established by the credit card companies which apply to the unit, which are available for review on the PSU Merchant Management website;\nCompliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), including completion of the annual self-assessment questionnaire;\nCompletion of required testing of security systems, network processes, and scheduling of quarterly scans, if processing credit cards through a network;\nEstablishment of clear policies regarding returns and refunds, in compliance with University policy and merchant rules; and\nNotification to Security Operations and Services (SOS) of potential breaches.\nSpecial charges or discounts resulting in a price differential between a credit card transaction and a transaction paid by cash or check are not permitted. Merchants must incorporate all costs related to credit card processing into fees charged for goods and services. The only exceptions are for a convenience fee for student account payments through eLion, or exceptions permitted under the conditions of the credit card merchant rules which have been reviewed and approved by the Corporate Controller. For example, merchants are not permitted to charge an additional fee if a payment is made by credit card versus cash or check.\nSANCTIONS:\nCompliance- Merchants who are not compliant with approved security, storage, and processing procedures per both University and PCI DSS standards will have merchant accounts revoked or suspended.\nSecurity Issues- The unit's network connection may be disabled due to breach or other security issue. Employees involved in breaches of credit card information are subject to the full range of sanctions, including loss of computer or network access privileges, disciplinary action, suspension, termination of employment and possible legal action. Some violations may constitute criminal offenses under local, state or federal laws. The University will carry out its responsibility to report such violations to appropriate authorities.\n ESTABLISHING A MERCHANT ACCOUNT OR TERMINAL ID:\nUniversity units that wish to accept credit cards as a form of payment must first collaborate with the Financial Officer and IT leader for the administrative area to determine if applying for an account is appropriate. In some cases, a unit may have a merchant account, but may have a need to set up a unique Terminal Identification (TID) under that merchant account for a particular unit. If agreement is reached that a merchant account and\/or terminal is appropriate, the unit must apply by completing a Credit Card Processing Merchant Request (available on GURU). This application must be completed in full, with the required signatures obtained. The Financial Officer is responsible for forwarding the request to the Corporate Controller's Office for final approval and processing.\nUnits applying for a merchant account or terminal ID must have a clear business purpose for processing credit card transactions, and will need to identify annual expected dollar volume, transaction volume and expected means of receiving credit card information (in person, phone, fax, mail, web). Units are responsible for all setup, operations, and maintenance costs, including security and breach management. On the application form, the unit must indicate which credit card processing will be used. Applications for merchant accounts may be denied if it is determined that another unit should be processing such payments, for example:\nOnly the Bursar and Outreach may process credit card transactions for fees on the student account.\nConferences and other programs with an external audience must be arranged through Outreach, per policy AD03.\nIf an application for a new merchant account or terminal ID is approved, the Corporate Controller's Office will coordinate with the credit card processor to establish a new merchant account (or terminal ID). The Corporate Controller's Office will notify the Financial Officer when the account is established.\nIf any changes are made in how credit card transactions are processed (i.e., move from POS terminals to AIS eCommerce Services), a revised Credit Card Processing Merchant Request must be submitted and approved.\n CONTROL AND REPORTING:\nIt is the responsibility of the area that accepts credit cards to assure that all credit card sales are recorded on area and University accounting records. The selling unit must establish strict internal controls and reconciliation methods to assure that credit card sales have been properly recorded on central University records. In addition, credit card sales must be reported to the University on a Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR), through the appropriate Integrated Student Information System (ISIS) reporting channels, or through the Report of Electronic Cash Receipts (RECR) available for those processing through AIS eCommerce services. Credit card sales must be reported to the University the same day or the following business day that they are reported to the contracting bank (upon settlement).\n TERMINATING MERCHANT OR TERMINAL IDs:\nUnits who no longer have a need for a merchant or terminal ID must contact the Corporate Controller's Office, through their Financial Officer, to formally terminate the merchant ID or terminal ID. The Corporate Controller's Office will notify other offices, such as AIS eCommerce Services and Security Operations and Services, as well as contacting the processor to close the account. Units are responsible for maintaining records for three years even though the merchant account or terminal ID has been closed.\nRETURN AND REFUNDS:\nSelling units which participate in credit card sales must offer an equitable exchange or return policy. In cases where the customer wishes to return a purchase for credit, or receive a refund for unused services, a credit must be issued via the same credit card that was used to process the original sales transaction. Refunds by cash are not permitted. Refunds by check are permitted only when a credit cannot be issued through the original credit card processing resources. Refer to Policy FN08 for guidance on refunds by check.\nDOCUMENTATION OF CARDHOLDER COMPLAINTS:\nAs a merchant, units are required to keep a written record of all customer complaints where a credit card was used for payment. The follow information must be included in your written record for future reference:\nCardholder\u2019s name\nThe units reference number, account number, or order number (not the full credit card number)\nThe date and time the cardholder asserted the claim\nThe nature of the claim\nThe action taken to resolve the dispute (this section should be very detailed)\nThis documentation should be kept with your original transaction information so that everything is together and can be accessed in the future if needed.\nHandling of cardholder complaints\/disputes must follow the specific procedures as required by the Merchant Services Agreement and comply with the Fair Credit Billing Act. The University processor should be contacted with any questions regarding the handling of cardholder complaints.\nChargebacks must be responded to in a timely basis. More detail on chargeback procedures is available on the PSU Merchant Management website.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nMore detailed information about the processing of credit card sales is available on the PSU Merchant Management Website.\u00a0\nEffective Date: November 30, 2010\n\tDate Approved: November 29, 2010\n\tDate Published: November 29, 2010 (Editorial changes- September 25, 2013)\nMost recent changes:\nSeptember 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas. Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University\u2019s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.\nThis policy shall not be construed to restrict academic freedom at the University, nor shall it be construed to restrict constitutionally protected expression.\nConduct prohibited by this policy may also violate applicable federal and state law. Additional information about how to pursue or report a violation of this policy, is set forth below.\nCONDUCT PROHIBITED BY THIS POLICY (\u201cProhibited Conduct\u201d):\nHarassment means behavior consisting of physical or verbal conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it substantially interferes with an individual\u2019s employment, education or access to University programs, activities or opportunities and would detrimentally affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances. Harassment may include, but is not limited to, verbal or physical attacks, stalking, graphic or written statements, threats, or slurs. Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited Harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs and the status of the individuals involved. Information regarding issues of sexual or gender-based harassment specifically, including definitions and information about the University\u2019s procedures for reporting and processing such incidents, can be found in University Policy AD85.\nDiscrimination is conduct of any nature that denies an individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employment, education, or living environment, because of the individual\u2019s age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.\nRetaliation, as defined in University Policy AD67, is also prohibited by this policy and may subject the individual who retaliates in violation of this or other University policy to discipline or sanctions.\nREPORTING INCIDENTS OF DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT OR CONDUCT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY THIS POLICY:\nThe University encourages anyone who becomes aware of possible Prohibited Conduct to immediately report such Prohibited Conduct to the appropriate individuals or offices, as set forth below.\nIf there is any danger to person or property, individuals are strongly encouraged to first report the incident to the applicable police or public safety department.\nIncidents of Gender-based Discrimination, as defined in this Policy AD91, should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator via one of the following methods:\nFill out the form on the Title IX website:\nContact the Title IX Coordinator directly, via telephone or email:\n\t\tDanny Shaha, Title IX Coordinator\n\t\t120 Boucke Building, University Park, PA 16802\n\t\tPhone: (814) 863-0342\n\t\tEmail: jds49@psu.edu or titleix@psu.edu\nAll other forms of potential discrimination should be reported as follows:\nReporting all other forms of potential discrimination\nFor Conduct Committed by\nReport To\nContact Information\nStudents or Student Organizations\nOffice of Student Conduct\n(814) 863-0342kxf6@psu.edu\nEmployees or third parties\nAffirmative Action Office\n\t\t\t\tOffice of Human Resources, Employee Relations Division\n\t\t\t\tOffice of Ethics and Compliance\n(814) 863-0471, aao@psu.edu\n\t\t\t\t(814) 865-1412\n\t\t\t\t(814) 867-5088, psoec@psu.edu\nStudents, employees, or third parties affiliated with the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics\nJulie Del Giorno, Director of Athletics Integrity and Investigative Services\n865-8391jad70@psu.edu\nStudents, employees, or third-parties at the Penn State College of Medicine\nKim Lantz Yoder, Equity Officer and Deputy Title IX Coordinator\n(717) 531-0003, ext. 283353kyoder1@psu.edu\nNote: This Policy addresses gender-based discrimination as defined above.

If exceptions are deemed to be necessary, such requests will be routed (via the budget amendment form) to the University Budget Office, which \u00a0in turn will route the request to the appropriate senior University officer for approval.\nFRINGE BENEFITS:\nEach administrative area with general funds will have a fringe benefits budget (with budget function established as employee benefits).\u00a0 The permanent amounts in this budget consist of reallocations from Central billing accounts.\u00a0 These reallocations will be adjusted for annual changes in the fringe rate.\u00a0 In addition, the amounts will be adjusted for general salary increase allocations from Central, reorganizations\/budgetary realignments of administrative areas and other allocations (as approved) from Central sources.\nThe amounts in the administrative area fringe benefits budget must be budgeted in fringe benefits object codes (see Object Classification Codes).\u00a0 Any budgetary adjustments to the budget (via the budget amendment form) will be routed to the University Budget Office Central Desk for review.\u00a0 Temporary adjustments may be made to this budget for purposes including transferring funds to accounts with actual fringe benefits charges.\u00a0 The amount in this budget will not be included for calculation of a recycling base.\u00a0 Consistent with the budget model for University Outreach, fringe benefits budget funds, either permanent or temporary, may not be transferred to any Outreach administrative area.\nOFFSETTING INCOME AND EXPENSE BUDGETS:\nCertain departmental budgets contain estimated fees, sales or other income which usually are offset by like amounts in the expense budget for the same departments. Since the expense budget is authorized on the assumption that the total estimated income for such budgets will be realized, it is the responsibility of the budget executive not to incur actual expenditures in excess of actual income received during the year. Permanent reductions in departmental expense and income budgets are required whenever departmental operations experience a curtailment of income of a continuous nature. Temporary reductions are required if curtailment of income occurs but is not expected to continue in the following fiscal year starting July 1.\nCAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS:\nCharges for construction or other major improvements to facilities are not normally provided as part of operating budgets.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the University Budget Officer.\nEffective Date: August 6, 2014\u00a0\n\tDate Approved: July 17, 2014\n\tDate Published: August 6, 2014\nMost Recent Changes:\nAugust 6, 2014 - Clarifying edits to DEPARTMENTAL ALLOTMENT BUDGET CONTROL section.

This risk assessment is handled by the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) prior to Subaward\/Subcontract execution; once approved, the Subrecipient is monitored over the life of the Subaward\/Subcontract at various levels. The risk assessment process described below is further illustrated in the Subrecipient Risk Assessment Flowchart.\nOSP will review the proposed Subrecipient's single audit (if applicable) or independently audited financial statement (AFS) in order to identify ANY adverse findings or material weaknesses (not just those related to PSU funds) if:\nThe Subaward\/Subcontract is $500K\/year or greater, or\nThe Subrecipient is an organization that PSU has never worked with before, or\nThe Subrecipient does not qualify as a \u201clow risk\u201d auditee in the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.\nIf there are no adverse findings, OSP will proceed with Subaward\/Subcontract issuance. If there are adverse findings, PSU's Subaward Policy Specialist (SPS) will review the findings to identify their severity and assess the quality of the Subrecipient's proposed corrective action plan.\nOther criteria considered in evaluating risk include, but are not limited to, the following:\nSubrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar Subaward\/Subcontracts\nResults of Subrecipient's previous audits\nWhether the Subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems\nWhether the Subrecipient has an approved\/compliant property control system in place\nInherent risk of the federal program\nPrior history of working with Subrecipient\nPrior oversight and monitoring received by the Subrecipient\nNature and complexity of the proposed research project\nFiscal maturity of the Subrecipient\nSubaward\/Subcontract period of performance\nType of prime award\nType of Subrecipient\nLower Risk \nLower risk Subrecipients are typically entities with current annual single audits (or equivalent) containing \"unqualified\" opinions on their financial statements, and which have no reported material weaknesses in their internal controls. In the Federal Audit Clearinghouse, these entities are considered \"low-risk auditees\". If the Subrecipient is not included in the Federal Audit Clearinghouse, the criteria listed above are used as the basis for evaluating risk.\nIf the proposed Subrecipient is deemed to be lower risk, PSU will rely upon the inclusion of the following or similar statement in the Subaward\/Subcontract Agreement to learn of potential problems: \"Subrecipient certifies by signing this Subaward Agreement that it complies with the Uniform Guidance, will provide notice of the completion of required audits and any adverse findings which impact this subaward as required by parts 200.501-200.521, and will provide access to records as required by parts 200.336, 200.337, and 200.201 as applicable.\u201d\nHigher Risk \nPotentially higher risk Subrecipients are most often entities which have not completed annual single audits, or whose audit results have demonstrated weaknesses in administering federal funding, a history of failing to adhere to applicable provisions of contracts and grant agreements, or weak internal control structures. Higher risk Subrecipients can also include start-up entities with limited resources or prior experience in performing research, and foreign entities.\nSpecial Actions for Higher Risk Subrecipients \nIf any identified problems cannot be readily remedied, OSP will categorize the Subrecipient (or the specific Subaward\/Subcontract) as higher risk and insist upon a higher level of scrutiny. At such time, OSP will then work with the Principal Investigator (PI) and College\/Unit Research Office to ascertain whether or not a Subaward\/Subcontract should be issued, what special terms and conditions should be considered for inclusion in the Subaward\/Subcontract, as well as what additional oversight requirements might be necessary to adequately monitor the Subaward\/Subcontract. Some of these additional requirements (e.g., more frequent financial and programmatic reporting, shorter periods of performance, smaller, more frequent funding allocations, more detailed invoices or backup documentation, training and\/or technical assistance for Subrecipients, on-site reviews of Subrecipients) may become the responsibility of the PI and related College Research Office. For Subawards\/Subcontracts $150K and less, OSP may mitigate risk by issuing fixed price agreements (subject to the prior approval of the sponsor). OSP is responsible for ensuring that adequate arrangements are in place to mitigate the additional risk to the University before issuing or continuing Subaward\/Subcontracts with higher risk Subrecipients. In extreme cases, where OSP lacks confidence in the proposed Subrecipient's ability to manage federal funds responsibly, OSP will decline to issue the Subaward\/Subcontract.\nDURING THE LIFE OF THE SUBAWARD \/ SUBCONTRACT:\nPrincipal Investigator (PI) Responsibilities\nThe PI has first line responsibility for University monitoring of the programmatic and financial performance and progress on a Subaward\/Subcontract. He or she must be informed of and acknowledge this responsibility before any Subaward\/Subcontract is issued. Duties of the PI (working in conjunction with the College Research Office) during the life of the Subaward\/Subcontract are as follows:\nUnderstand the terms and conditions of the prime award, including those flowed down to the Subrecipient and those that may have been imposed by the University, and monitor the Subrecipient's adherence to the Subaward\/Subcontract's terms and conditions. Such monitoring may take place through desk audits, and through phone calls, emails, site visits, meetings, or other regular contact.\nReview the Subrecipient's invoices to confirm they meet the following criteria:\nSubaward\/Subcontract requirements are met,\ncosts incurred are in accordance with the approved budget during the approved period of performance and overall cost limitations,\ncosts incurred are aligned with the technical progress reported to date, and\ncosts are allowable, allocable and reasonable relative to the prime sponsor's terms\n\t\t\t\tand conditions and the Subaward\/Subcontract issued by the University. In the event the level of detail included on an invoice is not sufficient to fully understand the costs, or if it appears that some costs may be excessive or understated, the PI is responsible for questioning the Subrecipient's expenditures or requesting an explanation or further documentation, if appropriate, prior to approving an invoice.\ncost sharing commitments are appropriately reflected and met, if applicable.\n\nPersonally approve Subrecipient invoices, review expenditure statements, and submit Subrecipient invoices for institutional approvals and payment in a timely manner, consistent with the terms of the Subaward\/Subcontract.\nMonitor the Subrecipient's technical progress in terms of the Statement of Work and any\n\t\trequired milestones. If technical progress is not acceptable, or if technical reports required of the Subrecipient are not prepared timely, the PI is responsible for contacting the Subrecipient to address these issues.\nPlan for efficient completion of performance and closeout of the Subaward\/Subcontract by requiring that the period of performance end no later than the end date of the prime award, and that the Subrecipient's final invoice, final technical report, and any other required deliverables, including any applicable closeout reports, be submitted to the University no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the period of performance or as otherwise stated in the Subaward\/Subcontract terms and conditions.\nAssist the College Research Office, upon request, in obtaining or reviewing reports, advising during risk analyses, complying with additional monitoring responsibilities for higher risk Subrecipients, obtaining audit information or monitoring a Subrecipient's adherence to corrective action plans.\nCollege Research Office Responsibilities\nThe College Research Office is responsible for the following:\nReview and approve all subrecipient invoices (after departmental\/PI review).\nRequest additional information, or confirmation, for any invoiced cost which appears to differ from the approved budget or appears to be unclear, unusual, unreasonable or unallowable.\nVerify that the subrecipient's indirect costs as charged are in compliance with the indirect cost rate specified in the Subaward\/Subcontract.\nEnsure accurate and timely payment of all invoices.\nCoordinate through the PI and OSP to assure that proper financial closeout procedures are followed.\nOffice of Sponsored Programs (OSP) Responsibilities\nOSP is responsible for the following:\nPerform risk assessment prior to issuing Subaward\/Subcontract, including financial audit reviews.\nPrepare, negotiate, and ensure the execution of the Subaward\/Subcontract in accordance with the budget and work statement as outlined in the prime contract.\nAdvise Subrecipients of requirements imposed on them by federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contract and grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements issued by the College\/Unit Research Office or PI.\nRequire each Subrecipient to permit the University and its auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary in accordance with Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.331.\nRequest and review the Subrecipient\/s single audit (if applicable) or the audited financial statement on an annual basis if the Subaward\/Subcontract requires a higher level of scrutiny (as determined by the analysis above). All findings will be reviewed by the Subaward Policy Specialist (SPS) to determine if additional oversight measures are required.\nOSP may rely upon the Subrecipient to self-report any adverse findings if the Subaward\/Subcontract does not require a higher level of scrutiny.\nConsult with the College Research Office when a Subrecipient\u2019s Final Invoice contains costs which differ from the approved budget or appear to be unclear, unusual or unallowable.\nReview documentation submitted by College at closeout to verify Subrecipient monitoring performed.\nCLOSEOUT:\nPrincipal Investigator (PI) Responsibilities\nPIs are responsible for obtaining final technical reports from their Subrecipients, completing the Certification of Technical Completion form, and retaining a copy in their project file. PIs are encouraged to remind Subrecipients of this need well in advance of the due date for such reports.\nCollege Research Office Responsibilities\nThe College obtains the final invoice from the Subrecipient and reviews for the information below (College\/Unit is responsible for the same type of review and approval as is required for the routine monthly invoice evaluations). The College must make certain this information is clearly provided prior to submitting the documentation to OSP for the purpose of requesting release of final payment and closeout. If the required information is not found on the final invoice, the College must seek the missing items from the Subrecipient.\nIs invoice clearly marked \"FINAL\"?\nDoes the invoice include current and cumulative costs incurred (including cost sharing, if required by the Subaward\/Subcontract)?\nIf cost sharing was required, was the Subrecipient's obligation met?\nWere any special cost provisions made part of the Subaward\/Subcontract followed by the Subrecipient?\nDoes the invoice include the Subaward\/Subcontract number?\nDoes the invoice include the period during which the costs were incurred?\nDoes the invoice include a certification as to the truth and accuracy of the invoice?\nThe College forwards a copy of the final cumulative invoice and completed Certification of Technical Completion to OSP, along with request for processing and approval of release of final payment.\nOffice of Sponsored Programs (OSP) Responsibilities\nIf the Subrecipient\/Subcontractor required a higher level of scrutiny, OSP will verify that copies of all of the single audits (or AFS\u2019s) issued prior to the end date of the Subaward\/Subcontract have been received and that any issues raised have been addressed. (Copies of required single audits and AFS\u2019s will be saved electronically for record retention purposes.) Documentation of this review will be on file and should be considered prior to closing out the Subaward\/Subcontract.\nIf the Subaward\/Subcontract did not require a higher level of scrutiny, OSP will close it out upon receipt of all required closeout documentation (e.g., certification of technical completion, proper final invoice, etc.).\nOSP reviews documentation submitted by College to verify subrecipient monitoring.\nOSP reviews and approves final invoices following College\/PI review and acceptance.\nOSP may request other final reports, including property reports, patent reports, and Assignment and Release documents, as required by the Subaward\/Subcontract.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther sources in GURU may also apply, especially:\nRA80 \u2013 Subawards and Subcontracts\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating parts of RAG22) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by the implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nDecember 23, 2014 - New Policy Guideline, to formalize the University\u2019s current practices and existing guidance regarding Subrecipient Monitoring, and to better define the roles of the various units involved in subaward\/subcontract management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.330 - 200.332 are the federal regulations that define the requirements for recipients of federal funds with respect to Subrecipient Monitoring and Management.

Further, the First Amendment of the United States' Constitution assures the right of free expression. In a community which recognizes the rights of its members to hold divergent views and to express those views, sometimes ideas are expressed which are contrary to University values and objectives. Nevertheless, the University cannot impose disciplinary sanctions upon such expression when it is otherwise in compliance with University regulations.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR01 - Fair Employment Practices,\nHR11 - Affirmative Action in Employment at The Pennsylvania State University,\nAC76 - Faculty Rights and Responsibilities,\nHR79 - Staff Grievance Procedure,\nAD85 - Sexual And\/or Gender-Based Harassment and Misconduct (Including Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, and Related Inappropriate Conduct) (Formerly Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Related Inappropriate Conduct)\nMost recent changes:\nJuly 12, 2011\u00a0 - Revised the DEFINITION and POLICY sections to bring the University into compliance with GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJanuary 1, 2007\u00a0 - Clarification of existing policy and practice in POLICY section, as approved by the President's Council.\nMay 19, 2006 - Changes to the DEFINITION and POLICY sections.\nAugust 30, 2001 - Significant changes to the PURPOSE, DEFINITION, and POLICY sections.\nJuly 8, 1994 - Eliminated underline and footnote from POLICY section.\nNovember 9, 1992 - Added underline to the sentence involving penalty under the POLICY section and added footnote suspending enforcement of the underlined sentence.\nFebruary 26, 1990 - Added definition of\u00a0 'intolerance.'\nMay 16, 1988 - New policy.\n\u00a0\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nJuly 11, 2011>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nJuly 12, 2011>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nJuly 12, 2011>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The University is committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others.

Below are the responsibilities for each of the positions involved with the management of sponsored programs:\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: It is the Principal Investigator's (PI) responsibility to conduct and complete the scientific and scholarly work, submit satisfactory reports, meet the sponsor's application guidelines, oversee all aspects of subawards and subcontracts including the monitoring of the programmatic and financial performance and progress (See RAG80), and certify that terms and conditions of the award are fully met. The PI is responsible for all financial aspects of the award including the resolution of unallowable expenditures or over-expenditures. The PI also needs to ensure that all costs are reasonable, allocable, allowable and in compliance with sponsor requirements and regulations (See RA10). This includes the confirmation of effort performed on the award, as well as justification of all costs charged to the award as required and part of the original proposal. The PI must also understand and comply with RP06 \u2013 Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests.\nADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT STAFF: In providing support to the PI, administrative support staff is responsible for assuring that adequate justification and documentation is provided for all expenditures, including labor costs and transfers.\nDEPARTMENT CHAIR OR BUDGET ADMINISTRATOR: In his\/her capacity as an academic administrator, the department chair is responsible for the activities in that chair's unit. As related to sponsored projects, the chair is responsible to ensure that the PI is eligible to apply for funds and that the activity is appropriate and fits within the academic mission of the unit.\nRESEARCH ADMINISTRATOR: In providing administrative support, the Research Administrator is responsible for reviewing sponsor guidelines and working with the PI to submit an accurate and complete proposal. When awarded, the Research Administrator sets up the accounting information for the project and tracks its activity through the closeout of the award. He or she also assists the PI with rebudgeting and adjustments as required.\nFINANCIAL OFFICER: As the Corporate Controller's representative for the area, the Financial Officer is responsible for review and approval of research expenditures to ensure that they are reasonable, allocable, allowable based on Penn State costing policies, and consistently applied. Financial Officers also must ensure that all University policies and procedures are followed.\nOFFICE OF SPONSORED PROGRAMS: The Office of Sponsored Programs is responsible for reviewing grants and contracts, identifying problematic clauses, negotiating acceptable terms and conditions, and implementing special compliance requirements. The Office of Sponsored Programs also reviews proposal submissions to ensure that representations and certifications are accurate and consistent with sponsor guidelines and Penn State policies.\nRESEARCH ACCOUNTING: Research Accounting is responsible for submitting timely and accurate invoices and reports according to the Sponsor's payment terms and conditions.\nRESEARCH PROTECTIONS: The Office for Research Protections is responsible for reviewing projects involving human subjects, animal subjects, radioisotopes, biohazards, and financial conflicts of interest.\nCOMPLIANCE:\nFalse Claims Act (FCA)\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) (US Code: 31 USC 3729) makes it a crime for any person or organization to knowingly make a false record or file a false claim with the government for payment. This Act was further expanded through The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) (Public Law 111-21). These and related amendments are applicable to the administration of federally sponsored research, and impose liability on any person who knowingly:\nsubmits a false or fraudulent claim for payment,\ncauses such a claim to be submitted for payment,\nmakes, uses, or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim,\nconspires to get such a claim paid or approved, or\nmakes a false record or statement to conceal or avoid an obligation to pay money to the government.\nThose managing federally sponsored awards, especially Principal Investigators, are subject to the False Claims Act and can be criminally prosecuted for mismanagement of federal funds. Therefore, those managing these funds must take responsibility for understanding costing policies and the impact on their specific sponsored awards.\nSpecific Issues Relating to Allocation of Costs\nPIs and others with responsibility for sponsored research need to be aware that:\nAny costs allocable to a sponsored project may not be shifted to another sponsored project in order to meet deficiencies caused by cost overruns, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or terms of the sponsored project, or for other reasons of convenience, even on a temporary basis. In addition, any costs allocable to activities sponsored by industry, foreign governments, or other sponsors may not be shifted to another sponsored project. PIs must ensure that costs which benefit multiple projects are properly allocated to all projects based on a reasonable allocation method.\nWhen managing multiple awards, utmost care must be given to manage each award separately, and not to view the various sponsored awards as one large award pool. Generalized costs allocable to different awards cannot be paid on one award one time and a different award the next time \u2013 the costs need to be allocated based on usage or another reasonable method for each incurred transaction. The University's accounting system allows for the allocation of costs to multiple awards at the time of the transaction.\nSee the Allocable Costs section of RA10 \u2013 Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards for additional details.\nReporting Non-Compliance\nAnyone involved in sponsored award administration who believes that a non-compliance issue has arisen must contact the Research Administrator, Financial Officer or the Compliance Hotline. PIs and Co-PIs have the primary responsibility for assuring that all costs charged to the sponsored award are related to the project. The PI should consult with the Research Administrator and\/or Financial Officer regarding any questions about costing policies or specific award compliance issues.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may also apply, especially:\n RA10 \u2013 Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards\nRAG80 \u2013 Sub-Recipient Monitoring\nRP06 \u2013 Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish appropriate policies for the stewardship of sponsored projects, and to identify the roles and responsibilities of all individuals participating in sponsored program administration."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy03","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergencies Involving Students | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesEmergencies Involving Students \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY03\nEmergencies Involving Students\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose:\nEmergency Assistance:\nReporting Emergencies:\nNotifications to Families of Students Involved in Emergencies\nEmergencies Involving Students While Engaged in University Travel\nReporting Accidents or Illnesses \nFurther Information\n\n\nEMERGENCY ASSISTANCE:\nIt is the policy of the University to render emergency assistance to students who are seriously injured, suffer serious illness, or experience other personal emergencies while attending the University, and to notify and assist the families of students who have died, are seriously ill or injured, are missing or experience other personal emergency situations.\nREPORTING EMERGENCIES:\nThe designated Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs atUniversity Park, or the Director of Student Affairs at other locations, is to be notified immediately of all emergencies involving students.

Solicitation\nContacts\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe Office of Annual Giving provides and supports the Approved Platforms to host crowdfunding campaigns and, with appropriate approvals, will support campaigns launched via an Approved Platform.\u00a0 In addition to any support offered by the Office of Annual Giving, successful crowdfunding campaigns will need numerous internal advocates of and other approvals for the campaign prior to the launch of the campaign on the Approved Platform.\nDEFINITIONS:\nApproved Platform- internet websites hosting and facilitating crowdfunding which are approved by the Office of Annual Giving from time to time.\u00a0\nCrowdfunding- an exclusively internet-based social fundraising effort in which a group of individuals solicit the general public for donations to support a project or initiative with which they are involved, or of which they are supportive.\nCampaign- a fundraising effort launched on an Approved Platform that is designed to raise a specified sum of money within a defined timeframe to meet an advertised goal or need.\nCampaign Leadership- individual(s) affiliated with Penn State who oversee the application, preparation, launch, and peer solicitation efforts related to a crowdfunding campaign launched on an Approved Platform.\nData Steward- individual or department at Penn State who is responsible for oversight and management of the particular data involved.\nPOLICY:\nThe Office of Annual Giving is assigned responsibility for approving and coordinating crowdfunding campaigns on an Approved Platform.\nAny person, group or entity affiliated with Penn State wishing to conduct a crowdfunding campaign in the name of Penn State and in furtherance of its mission shall begin the process by applying to use an Approved Platform (process described below). If the application is approved by the Office of Annual Giving, the Office of Annual Giving will make available Penn State resources and support in the execution of the crowdfunding campaign. Approved crowdfunding campaigns will be considered a sanctioned fundraising initiative of The Pennsylvania State University.\nAll Penn State policies and procedures are applicable to crowdfunding.\u00a0 This includes research compliance policies including, but not limited to, policies on intellectual property, conflict of interest, Human Participants Research (IRB), use of biohazardous materials (IBC and UIC), or Use of Vertebrate Animals (IACUC). Crowdfunding proposals for large or general research projects will not be approved. However, in certain circumstances, such as limited or discrete research projects (e.g., proof of concept funding) or certain incidental aspects of research, such as, student experiences, lab supplies, technology, or equipment that may be used in other applications outside the current applicant's research, may be approved. Any person, group or entity wishing to conduct crowdfunding campaigns for any research-related project must first consult the Office of Research Protections (http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/orp or (814) 865-1775) and obtain all necessary compliance approvals to ensure that their fundraising project will be conducted responsibly and in accordance with regulations that protect the human participants, animals, students, and personnel involved prior to the campaign application being submitted.\nCampaign leadership is responsible for ensuring that they have met all applicable requirements prior to the submission of their application, and must produce any required documentation of compliance when the application is submitted. Documents can be sent to crowdfunding@ddar.psu.edu.\nApproved Platforms do not provide intellectual property protection, and participants are advised that presenting your crowdfunding campaign to the public could result in others using your ideas and research before you can protect them with patents or other legal measures. Penn State Intellectual Property Policies and Guidelines apply to all work performed using crowdfunding resources.\nAny merchandise produced by the crowdfunding campaign for promotional purposes using the Penn State name or any of its marks or symbols must follow licensing guidelines and may be subject to prior execution of a written promotional agreement from the Licensing Programs Office.\u00a0 See AD07 \u2013 Use of University Name, Symbols and\/or Graphic Devices.\nParticipants are responsible for compliance with all laws and all other relevant University policies and procedures.\u00a0 Please see the list of policies under Cross References below for links to certain relevant policies.\u00a0 This list is not intended to be all inclusive.\nPenn State and the Office of Annual Giving reserve the right to refuse donations and contributions from any crowdfunding effort hosted on any platform other than an Approved Platform. Penn State does not accept payments from services such as PayPal or Amazon, and payments from those and similar third party payment services which aggregate payments will not be accepted on any Approved Platform. Gifts through an Approved Platform may be tax deductible if made under Penn State's tax exempt status and if they otherwise qualify for a tax deduction. Where appropriate, gift receipts will be issued to donors who make contributions to a crowdfunding campaign using an Approved Platform.\nAPPROVAL OF A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN:\nAll applications to use an Approved Platform will be reviewed by relevant parties within Penn State. However, final approval of a crowdfunding campaign on an Approved Platform rests solely with the Office of Annual Giving.\nIf an application is not approved by the Office of Annual Giving, but a person, group or entity wishes to conduct a crowdfunding campaign on any third-party platform, such person, group or entity may not do so in the name of Penn State.\u00a0 In addition, such person, group or entity may not use the name of Penn State or any of its marks or symbols for any purpose unless explicitly granted an exception in writing by the Office of Annual Giving in consultation with the Penn State Licensing Programs Office. The crowdfunding campaign may also not use Penn State alumni, parent, friend, or patient data in the execution of such outside campaign unless approved by the appropriate Data Steward. The conduct of any such outside campaign is done at the participant's sole risk, including any tax implications of raising funds on an individual basis and legal or criminal ramifications of utilizing patient data which is not in compliance with the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule.\nCROWDFUNDING SOLICITATION:\nAny individual, group or entity interested in creating a crowdfunding campaign on an Approved Platform may submit an application at any time using the applicable Approved Platform's crowdfunding application form. The application can be found at http:\/\/www.crowdfunding.psu.edu. Upon receipt, the director(s) for crowdfunding in the Office of Annual Giving, or other staff person as assigned, will review the application and arrange a consultation to discuss fund-raising potential, timing, audience and strategies.\nFees for a crowdfunding campaign are the responsibility of the applicant requesting the campaign and will be reviewed with the applicant during the initial consultation.

Guidelines are established by the donors and become a legal contract with the University, which dictates how the University may use the funds generated by an endowment. The individuals responsible for the management of endowments for the unit must assure that the spending from the account meets the guidelines set by the donors, including selection of recipients for scholarships and other awards.\nNote: All scholarships from endowed funds must be awarded through eSteward using the unique ISIS source code established by Student Financial Services for the endowment. Awarding through the source code will assure that the annual donor stewardship report accurately reflects those who received scholarships from the endowment. This policy applies to scholarships from all endowed funds regardless of exceptions noted below. Refer to Policy FN09 \u2013 Scholarships for more detail.\nGUIDELINES:\nTo assure appropriate stewardship and fiduciary management of endowed funds, all spending must be made directly from the endowment spending account and must adhere to the purpose and expenditure requirements stated in the endowment guideline. Transfers of funds from endowed \/ annually funded spending accounts into other University accounts are NOT permitted.\nThere are certain categories of endowments where transfers are permissible, due to the nature of the endowment, and these endowment spending accounts are exempt from the prohibition on transfers:\nLoan Funds where the guidelines specify transfers to other accounts.\nEndowed funds where the guidelines specify transfers to other accounts.\nEndowed funds with guidelines allowing expenditures in support of the Hershey Medical Center or Four Diamonds Fund, where these funds must be transferred to the appropriate accounts for expenditure.\nSpending account on Unrestricted Quasi Endowments (those with a single principal fund with the fund designation of 1907), given that these funds are University funds and have no donor stewardship requirements.\nExceptions to allow transfers from an endowment spending account, beyond those specified above, must be approved by the Office of the Corporate Controller and by the Office of University Development. Prior to submitting a request for exception, the request must be approved by both the Budget Executive and the Financial Officer. The request should be submitted to the Corporate Controller and include the following information:\nA detailed explanation providing a compelling reason why the funds must be transferred to another account for management and spending;\nA copy of the guideline for the endowed fund;\nA detailed explanation of how the account will be managed to facilitate accurate donor reports through the Office of Donor Relations on the expenditure of funds; and\nA detailed plan on how employees managing the transferred funds will be accountable for adhering to the donor guidelines.\nIf an exception is granted, all transfers must use a journal voucher, debiting object code 0427 for the endowed spending account, and crediting the funds to income object code 0046 in the receiving account. Endowed spending account transfers cannot be made to general funds unless specifically approved.\nNote: Object code 0420 is restricted to the disbursement of scholarships\/awards\/fellowships through ISIS and should never be used in a transaction within IBIS.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nFN09 - Scholarships\nFN15 - Establishing or Accepting Funds For Endowed or Named Annually Funded Accounts\nEffective Date: May 22, 2013\n\tDate Approved: May 21, 2013\n\tDate Published: May 22, 2013 (Editorial changes- January 5, 2015)\nMost Recent Changes:\nJanuary 5, 2015 - Editorial changes.

Although campus police or a security department does not have the primary responsibility to investigate a missing student incident involving a student living off campus, certain protocols within this policy may be applied to certain situations involving non-residential students. For example, we would expect that University staff and campus police would assist local authorities in their investigation of an off-campus Penn State student.\nEffort to locate a student will be directed through collaboration of Student Affairs staff, campus police or security department, local\/state authorities, and friends and family members of the missing student. When information is received by the University regarding a missing student, there will be no waiting period before an investigation is initiated.\u00a0 All investigative procedures will be governed by Student Affairs policy and procedures and federal, state, and local law.\nInitial Response\nThe first step in the process will be for staff to seek information related to the circumstances around the missing person allegation, then inform the campus police or security department. \u00a0Typically, the initial response will be coordinated by staff in Residence Life, other Student Affairs staff, and the campus police or security department. Staff should document the situation and create a factual written report while obtaining as many details as possible from persons reporting the incident. Initial staff investigations, prior to any formal police investigation, will include a thorough review of the student\u2019s recent activity on campus which may include, but not be limited to, questioning the student\u2019s roommates and friends, visiting the student's room or apartment, and a review of the student\u2019s recent use of his\/her ID card. While speaking with persons who reported the disappearance, staff should verify the accuracy of information previously provided. Understanding that in these types of incidents time is critical, the creation of a written report by Student Affairs staff should not deter them from \"verbally sharing\" important information with the campus police or security department.\nInvestigations\nThe campus, regional or State Police, who are the investigative agency, will decide when to dispatch officers to conduct a formal investigation. Formal police investigations and community notifications will typically take place after the initial staff investigation on the whereabouts of the student. Although the formal investigation of a missing student is the responsibility of the police, University staff will have a role in supporting the police investigation by providing valuable report information to them. University staff should only record pertinent facts (see above) and not include speculative information.\nThe responding officers will be apprised by staff of all information and the police will obtain a photograph of the student. Unless special circumstances apply, the students photograph will be obtained from the campus ID office. Securing the student\u2019s photo ID will require the designated Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs at University Park, or the senior Student Affairs administrator at the campus (hereafter referred to as \"AVP\"), to request in writing (through email) a copy of the photo ID from the Manager of the ID Office and Director of Information Systems for Auxiliary and Business Services. The Director of Information Systems for Auxiliary and Business Services or the Manager of the ID Office will send an electronic copy of the photo ID to the AVP, who will forward a copy of the photo ID to the campus police.\nStaff will work with the police to obtain from friends or acquaintances any notes, records, recordings of telephone communications pertaining to the student. As University protocol would require, the campus police or security department will be present with the Student Affairs staff when they search the missing student\u2019s room.\u00a0 The search will be initiated to obtain academic, housing, foods service, and general student record information that will help support the police in their efforts to locate the missing student. At different points in the investigation, the police may invite other individuals or authorities into the student search process (i.e. canine-aided search teams, air patrols, etc.)\nCommunications\nIf the student is not located within 24 hours, the AVP will be notified, and in collaboration with the police, will contact the person(s) listed on the student\u2019s Emergency Contact record or the student\u2019s parent or guardian to inquire about his\/her whereabouts and\/or alert that person that their student may be missing. Once this occurs, a University official, family member, or other appropriate person will make an official missing person report to the law enforcement agency within jurisdiction.\nThe campus police or a security department will keep the AVP apprised of the investigation as it continues. As the investigation progresses, the AVP will ensure that pertinent details are appropriately relayed to staff and will make notifications to supervisors and the University administration in accordance with established policies and procedures.\nIn accordance with Policy SY03, the AVP will also act as a liaison to the family. Through this role, the AVP will coordinate on-going communication with the family and friends of the missing student and help to provide additional support services that may be needed.\nPROVISIONS:\nNotifications\nIn accordance with general institutional emergency notification procedures, Penn State has provided a list of titles of persons and offices to which students, employees, or others, can contact if they have reason to believe a student who lives in on-campus student housing has been missing for 24 hours. It is the intent of this policy to direct individuals who believe a Penn State student is missing to immediately notify specific staff in the University administration, University Police, and local law enforcement. Likewise, the AVP will notify other areas, as appropriate, in accordance with policy SY03.\nSpecifically, staff in the Office of Residence Life, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Student and Family Services, University Police Services and Public Safety, and the senior Student Affairs professional at a campus, should be contacted so that they can coordinate efforts to locate the student. The list of positions, offices, and contact information to be utilized if a student goes missing from the campus is included in the University Contacts for Missing Students section at the end of this policy.\nIn addition to contacting these specific offices, anyone who has a concern that a student may have gone missing should alert any Penn State employee who they think will aid in the investigation of a student disappearance. Beyond notifications made by campus employees to University staff or campus police or campus security, in the absence of a campus police or campus security department, any missing student report must be referred immediately to the local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the geographical areas around the specific campus location.\nRegistering and Notifying Student Missing Contact\nIn accordance with this policy, students will be notified annually that each residential student of the University has the option to identify an individual to be contacted by the Penn State administration no later than 24 hours after the time that it is determined the student is missing.\nPenn State provides each student with the means and opportunity to register their confidential missing student contact information by logging into the University\u2019s Elion system and filling out the Address and Contact Information form. This missing student contact person can be anyone. This option is provided to students even if a student has already registered an individual as a general emergency contact. The student also has the option to identify the same individual for both their general emergency contact and missing student contact.\nMissing student contact information is registered confidentially. This information is private and only accessible to Penn State employees who are authorized campus officials. This information will not be disclosed to others with the exception to law enforcement personnel in the furtherance of a missing student investigation.\nIn accordance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 and this policy, Penn State will notify the missing the student\u2019s parents or guardian in addition to the person identified as the missing student contact person of any student who is under 18 years of age and not an emancipated individual. This contact will be made no later than 24 hours after the time that the student is determined to be missing.\nNotifying Law Enforcement\nPenn State will also notify the appropriate local law enforcement agency of the missing student unless the local law enforcement agency was the entity that made the determination that the student was missing. This notification will include any missing student who lives in on-campus housing regardless of age or status, and regardless of whether he or she registered a confidential missing student or general emergency contact person. This notification will be made no later than 24 hours after the time that the student is determined missing.\nIf the campus law enforcement personnel or campus security department has been notified that a student has gone missing, and makes a determination that a student who is the subject of a missing person report has been missing for more than 24 hours, Penn State staff will initiate emergency contact procedures as outlined in Penn State\u2019s policy and protocol.\nUniversity Contacts for Missing Students\nUniversity Park Campus\n\n\nAssistant Vice President for Student Affairs\n\t\t\tPenn State University\n\t\t\t129 Boucke Building\n\t\t\tUniversity Park, PA 16802\n\t\t\t814-863-4926\nSenior Director of Residence Life\n\t\t\tPenn State University\n\t\t\tUniversity Park, PA 16802\n\t\t\t201 Johnston Commons\n\t\t\t814-863-1710\n\n\nDirector, University Police\n\t\t\tPenn State University\n\t\t\t25 Eisenhower Parking Deck\n\t\t\tUniversity Park, PA 16802\n\t\t\t814-863-1111\nDean of Student Services\n\t\t\tDickinson Law School\n\t\t\tLewis Katz Building\n\t\t\tUniversity Park, PA 16802\n\t\t\t814-865-9035\n\n\nCommonwealth Campuses\n\n\n\nPenn State Abington\n\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management\n\t\t\t\t106 Sutherland Building\n\t\t\t\tAbington, PA 19001\n\t\t\t\t215-881-7600\nPenn State Altoona\n\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Affairs\n\t\t\t\t103 Slep Student Center\n\t\t\t\tAltoona, PA 16601\n\t\t\t\t814-949-5053\nPenn State Beaver\n\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Affairs\n\t\t\t\t101 Administration Building\n\t\t\t\tMonaca, PA 15061\n\t\t\t\t724-773-3957\nPenn State Berks\n\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management\n\t\t\t\t14B Perkins Student Center\n\t\t\t\tReading, PA 19610\n\t\t\t\t610-396-6066\nPenn State Behrend\n\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Affairs & Institutional Research\u00a0and Planning\n\t\t\t\t115 Reed Building\n\t\t\t\tErie, PA 16563\n\t\t\t\t814-898-6111\nPenn State Brandywine\n\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Affairs\n\t\t\t\t25 Yearsley Mill Road, Commons 209\n\t\t\t\tMedia, PA 19063\n\t\t\t\t610-892-1270\n\nPenn State Dickinson School of Law\n\t\t\t\t\tDirector of Student Services\n\t\t\t\t\t333 W.

This national and international leadership would be documented by (a) notable contributions to research published in leading journals and\/or books and creative accomplishments widely recognized for excellence; (b) prestigious awards and citations; and (c) a substantial record of invited lectures or performances delivered at prestigious institutions.\n\t\t\u00a0\nhave demonstrated significant leadership in raising the standards of the University with respect to teaching, research or creative activity, and service.\n\t\t\u00a0\nhave demonstrated excellent teaching skills and contributed significantly to the education of students who subsequently have achieved recognition of excellence in their fields.\n\t\t\u00a0\nNOMINATION AND SELECTION PROCEDURES:\nFaculty members, departments, or programs may nominate a candidate(s)for a Distinguished Professorship to the dean of the academic college in which the nominee is appointed. Nominations should normally be accompanied by three internal letters of support including one from the nominee's department head.Recent letters solicited for other purposes, including external letters of evaluation, may be submitted if available.\nThe dean of each college will appoint a committee of at least threeProfessors to review nominees and recommend candidates in consultation with the dean. The dean will forward the dossiers of candidates recommended forDistinguished Professorships to the Office of the President. Deans should include letters previously received in support of the nominee, as well as their own letter of endorsement.\nCandidates who meet the high standards of excellence reflected in the selection criteria will be designated Distinguished Professors by the President following a recommendation by the Executive Vice President and Provost.\nNUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED PROFESSORS:\nThe maximum number of Distinguished Professors in each college will not exceed ten (10) percent of the number of faculty on standing academic appointments at the rank of Professor. Colleges in which the addition of another Distinguished Professor would exceed the allotted percentage will not engage in the nomination process until such time as another appointment could be made within the limits specified.\nPROCESS:\nThe Distinguished Professor selection timeline will be as follows:\nOctober 1:\nNominations are delivered to the college selection committee.\nNovember 15:\nCandidates selected by the college committee and endorsed by the dean are forwarded to the Office of the President.\nJanuary 15:\nDistinguished Professor appointments are announced.\nExceptions to this timetable may be granted by the Executive VicePresident and Provost.\nREMUNERATION:\nBecause this distinctive recognition is not funded as are endowed chairs or professorships, there is no additional remuneration awarded by the Office of the President with this honor.

In this capacity, EHS is responsible for registering radiation-producing instruments with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Radiation Protection (PA DEP BRP), maintaining the University's inventory of instruments, evaluating system installations for suitable location and conformance to applicable standards and regulations, providing radiation safety training, establishing policies for issuing personal dosimetry, issuing personal dosimetry, providing general oversight and guidance as to sources of ionizing radiation, and for performing and documenting required safety inspections and surveys of radiation-producing instruments, where applicable.\nSupervisors:\nSupervisors are responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of the radiation-producing instruments under their control, adhering to the requirements of this policy, and for immediately informing EHS of the acquisition, modification, transfer, or disposal of systems. The supervisor is responsible for developing written operating procedures for each instrument and providing training on those procedures to respective users. In addition, supervisors of analytical and radiographic x-ray equipment are required to complete the radiation-producing equipment safety orientation provided by EHS, and ensuring that personnel under their supervision attend the same training provided by EHS.\nUsers:\nUsers of radiation-producing instruments are responsible for following the written operating procedures and performing all work in a safe manner. Users are also responsible for reporting to the supervisor any unusual or unsafe condition they discover with the radiation-producing instrument, and for suspending work with that instrument until the unsafe condition is rectified. In addition, users of analytical and radiographic x-ray equipment are required to complete the radiation-producing equipment safety orientation provided by EHS before beginning work with sources of ionizing radiation. Each supervisor is responsible to pay the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection registration fee for use of each radiation producing device under their jurisdiction or control. Procedures for payment are established through EHS.\nOPERATIONS:\nPrior to the use of radiation-producing instruments, supervisors shall prepare written operating procedures and review them with the user(s). The scope of these procedures will vary depending on the type and intended use of the instrument. The content shall be as a minimum that which satisfies the state regulations governing the specific type of instrument. Specific regulations can be accessed at the following links:\nLink to all Regulations\nMedical Regulations\nVeterinary Regulations\nIndustrial Regulations\nAnalytical Regulations\nAccelerators Regulations\nPersonnel monitoring of users is dependent on the type of radiation-producing instrument in use and the scope of the work to be performed. Users of veterinary, medical and most radiographic x-ray instruments are required to wear whole body dosimeters. For analytical x-ray instruments, individuals responsible for performing beam alignment or maintenance of the system that requires the presence of an open beam configuration are required to wear an extremity dosimeter. Personnel monitoring is not required for users of electron microscopes.\nEHS is responsible for providing personnel radiation monitors and maintaining dosimetry records. Monitors will be issued only to individuals who have completed and passed the required radiation-producing equipment safety orientation. Individuals who have been issued personnel dosimetry are required to wear their dosimeter whenever working with systems that require monitoring.\nUsers performing industrial radiography techniques are required to have radiation survey meters in use during all radiographic procedures. A survey meter is also required during maintenance or beam alignment procedures on analytical or radiographic equipment if these procedures require the x-ray tube to be energized, or if the procedure requires an open beam configuration.\nInspections of the safety devices and radiological surveys of analytical and radiographic equipment will be performed by EHS upon initial installation of the instrument and annually thereafter. Additional surveys may be required depending on changes in components or configuration of a system. Records of these inspections will be maintained by EHS.\nSystem safety devices, including shielding, interlocks, warning lights and alarms, may not be circumvented or bypassed without the written permission of the University's Radiation Safety Officer. The only exception to this requirement are system maintenance or beam alignment procedures that require the presence of a primary beam provided these procedures are documented and only performed by individuals approved to do so by the system supervisor. All safety devices must be reinstated before returning the system to routine operation.\nUse of University-owned instruments at non-University locations shall be approved by EHS in advance of use. Notification shall include the name of the supervisor responsible for the system, type of system to be used, intended location, purpose, duration of work, and a contact name and phone number of a responsible individual representing the non-University location.\nACQUISITION, TRANSFER, AND DISPOSAL OF EQUIPMENT:\nFaculty, supervisors, and users are strongly encouraged to consult with EHS as early as possible prior to ordering or installing any radiation-producing equipment. EHS can provide useful information concerning appropriate safety features, suitability of installation location and the safe operation of the equipment. All radiation-producing instruments are required to be registered with the PA DEP BRP. This includes, but is not limited to, any instrument maintained in storage or donated to the University.\nOnce installed, the supervisor must contact EHS and arrange to have the system inspected for required labeling, safety devices, radiation levels, and evaluation of the system location to assure user and non-user safety. This also applies to relocation of current systems to another University location. The system may not be put into routine service and operation until approved by EHS.\nTransferring a device to another supervisor within the University may require a safety evaluation of the new location and the new supervisor's radiation safety training status. Instruments being transferred, donated, or sold to another institution, company, or individual, requires a written notification to the PA DEP BRP. Supervisors are responsible for informing EHS prior to the transfer of the equipment. EHS is responsible for providing the written notification to the state.\nSupervisors must also inform EHS when a system is permanently removed from service and is to be either disposed of or used for parts. EHS is responsible for notifying the state that these systems are no longer in service and they will be removed from the University's inventory.\nDisposal of radiation-producing equipment through University salvage must take into account the proper disposal of all hazardous substances. Lead, oils, and x-ray tubes containing beryllium must be removed and disposed of as hazardous waste. Contact EHS for guidance on proper disposal.\nTRAINING:\nSupervisors and users of analytical and radiographic x-ray equipment must complete the radiation-producing equipment safety orientation provided by EHS prior to beginning work with sources of ionizing radiation. The training will consist of the following general topics: fundamentals of radiation safety; characteristics of radiation; units of radiation dose and quantity of radioactivity; significance of radiation dose; radiation protection standards; biological effects of radiation dose; levels of radiation from radiation sources; methods of controlling radiation dose: working time, distance and shielding; radiation detection instrumentation to be used; use of radiation survey instruments: operation, calibration and limitations; safety devices; survey techniques; use of personnel monitoring equipment; and the requirements of pertinent Federal and State regulations.\nFACILITY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\nLocation and use of radiation-producing equipment must be approved in advance by EHS, and shall be limited to areas that ensure the safety of users and non-users. The facility design or location shall be such that the dose rate in unrestricted areas does not exceed 0.002 rem in any one hour, if an individual were continuously present in the area, and shall not result in an individual member of the public receiving a total effective dose in excess of 0.1 rem in a year.\nEMERGENCIES:\nExposure to the primary beam of an analytical or radiographic x-ray source may result in serious injury. If a situation arises where an individual is accidentally exposed to the primary beam of a radiation-producing instrument, or if you suspect that an individual has been exposed, the following action is to be taken immediately:\nShut off the x-ray equipment and secure it from use by other individuals. Do not change the experimental or equipment configuration. The exposed individual's dose can best be evaluated and reconstructed if the system set-up is not altered in any way following the event.\nContact EHS at 814-865-6391. Inform them that an individual working with an x-ray device may have received an accidental radiation overexposure and that you need to contact the Radiation Safety Officer immediately.\nInform the supervisor of the system of the accident.\nIf this is a life threatening emergency such as electrical shock, fire, etc., dial 911 for emergency response.\nIn conjunction with the individual involved, system supervisor, and respective department safety officer, EHS will begin an investigation as to the circumstances of the event. The system in question shall remain out of service pending the results of the investigation and completion of any corrective actions, if needed. EHS is responsible for notifying the PA DEP BRP within 5 days of the occurrence, even if it is later determined that no accidental exposure occurred. The system may only be returned to service following written approval from the EHS office.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nSY01 - Environmental Health and Safety Policy\nSY04 - Employee Accidents - Reporting and Investigation\nSY20 - Hazardous Waste Disposal\nEffective Date: May 29, 2002\n\tDate Approved: May 23, 2002\n\tDate Published: May 29, 2002 (Editorial changes, June 11, 2014)\nMost recent changes:\nJune 11, 2014 - Editorial change to ANSI X-ray standards made in REFERENCES section.

Their primary responsibility to their respective subjects is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end, they devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending, and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although they may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their freedom of inquiry.\nAs teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before their students the best scholarly standards of their respective disciplines. They demonstrate respect for the student as an individual, and adhere to their proper role as intellectual guides and counselors. They make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect the students' true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation of students for private advantage and acknowledge significant assistance from them. They protect their students' academic freedom.\nAs researchers\/scholars, professors recognize that their goal is to discover, develop, and communicate new understanding. This goal is rarely achieved without making use of knowledge gained from others. Researchers must always exercise gracious and appropriate recognition of published work in the literature, conversations with colleagues, and the efforts of students who work under the researchers' guidance. They must be scrupulous in presentation of their own data; it must be verifiable as a result of the highest standards in data gathering techniques. They must be extremely careful in the use of data reported by others, especially if used in the formation of broad comparative or contradictory hypotheses, since they may not know of any compromising circumstances in such data gathering. They must be comprehensive in consideration of work with human subjects; they must have thoroughly researched all procedures, must have informed individuals involved of all aspects of their cooperation, and must report all responses accurately, both positive and negative results. As open-minded researchers, when evaluating the work of others, they must recognize the responsibility to allow publication of theories or experiments that may contradict their own findings, as only by free inquiry and dissemination of all facts will the fruits of the labor of the whole community be allowed to mature.\nAs colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. They respect and defend the free inquiry of their associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas they show due respect for the opinions of others. They acknowledge their academic debts and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. They accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution.\nAs members of their institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although they observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their rights to criticize and seek revision. They determine the amount and character of the work they do outside their institution with due regard to their paramount responsibilities within it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, they recognize the effect of this decision upon the programs of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.\nAs members of the community, professors have the rights and obligations of all citizens. They measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their respective subjects, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression that they speak or act for their respective colleges or the University (See AD07). As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have an articular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.\nAll tangible assets (including equipment, software, audio-visual material, theatrical costumes, etc.) owned, leased or operated by the University are to be used in the conduct of University programs and activities at University owned or leased locations.\nUniversity departments may offer services only to other University departments and only for University-related work. Permitted work includes,\u00a0instructional work for credit and non-credit courses, conferences, workshops, institutes, training programs, etc.; support for faculty research, publications, presentations, and outreach activities; services for recognized student organizations; and services for other organized student extramural activities.\nUniversity tangible assets and services may not be used for personal gain, by employees for purposes outside the scope of their employment (see also Policy HR35), or by students beyond their instructional requirements.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAdditional Policies to refer to would include:\nAD07 - Use of University Name, Symbols and\/or Graphic Devices,\nHR35 - Public Service by Members of the Faculty and Staff,\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest,\nIP02 - Coauthorship of Scholarly Reports, Papers and Publications (Formerly RA13),\nRP02 - Addressing Allegations of Research Misconduct (Formerly RA10, Handling Inquiries\/Investigations Into Questions of Ethics in Research and in Other Scholarly Activities), and\nRP03 - The Use of Human Participants in Research (Formerly Policy RA14).\nEffective Date: May 10, 1996\n\tDate Approved: June 10, 1996\n\tDate Published: June 24, 1996 (Editorial change, August 21, 2014)\nMost Recent Changes :\nAugust 21, 2014 - Editorial changes.

Falsification or fabrication of one's own data and unacknowledged use of data generated by others are unacceptable behaviors and constitute misconduct. The University maintains ownership of all data collected from research conducted at the University, under the auspices of the University, or with University resources, subject to restrictions stipulated in University-approved agreements with sponsors and other third parties.\nGuidelines:\nAccept primary responsibility for data collection, proper attribution, recording, storage, retention, and disposal or transfer to University Archives, as appropriate.\nScrupulously record data in a form that is easily accessible for analysis and review and, if the research is supported by external funding, readily identifiable with and traceable to the sponsored project.\nMaintain the privacy of data as required by confidentiality agreements and regulations.\nMake data immediately available to scientific supervisors and collaborators, as confidentiality agreements permit.\nPost-publication, share data with other interested researchers who seek to verify and\/or complement existing research.\nMaintain research data intact, preferably in original form, in accordance with University or sponsor's retention requirements or for a sufficient amount of time to allow for analysis of published results by other researchers, optimally a minimum of five years after publication.\nRESPONSIBLE AUTHORSHIP:\nAuthorship is the process by which the results of original research are translated to published form to facilitate the communication of new knowledge to the professional community. Thus, the integrity of the scholarly record is of paramount concern to the research community. See University Policy IP02, Co-Authorship of Scholarly Reports, Papers and Publications.\nGuidelines:\nAttest to the originality of work.\nAssign credit appropriately in publications by citing relevant work of others.\nDiscuss and resolve issues of authorship before beginning a study or as they arise during a study.\nAssign appropriate credit in publications to all those who have contributed significantly to the research process, including research staff, students, and support staff. See University Policy IP02, Co-Authorship of Scholarly Reports, Papers and Publications for further clarification on coauthorship.\nConfirm that all coauthors willingly agree to be listed as coauthors of publications and to assume responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of their contributions.\nActively involve all coauthors in reviewing and verifying any and all parts of the manuscript.\nIdentify a primary author to be responsible for the validity of the entire manuscript and for assuring that all contributions are appropriately recognized.\nAvoid honorary authorship, which is the practice of subscribing authorship to an individual who has not made a substantial contribution to a manuscript. Instead, utilize alternative forms of acknowledgment as allowed by the publication venue.\nInclude information in the publication on the sources of financial support for the research. Be cautious of financial sponsorship that prohibits the naming of the sponsor in publication.\nDISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH:\nThe University strongly upholds principles of academic freedom, and as an institution serving the public, encourages every effort to ensure that research conducted under the auspices of the University can be freely pursued and disseminated. Researchers are urged to be aware of overtly commercialized research that attempts to place boundaries on academic freedom to pursue research for the good of society and to make research results available to the general public. However, the nature of some research, particularly industrial and defense-related research, does present some circumstances where it may be appropriate and necessary for restrictions to be placed on dissemination. Where such situations are warranted, researchers should practice caution and abide by the following guidelines.\nGuidelines:\nConduct classified research only in the Applied Research Laboratory.\nMaintain the secrecy of classified research.\nMaintain the confidentiality of proprietary information that has been provided to enable research.\nRefrain from publishing or otherwise disseminating research related to inventions until appropriate disclosure filings are made to protect your intellectual property.\nAbide by export control regulations that can place legal restrictions on the ability to publish or present.\nRefrain from disseminating research that may result in future harm to the public.\nPUBLICATION PRACTICES:\nTimely communication of research results is the primary method for the public dissemination of new knowledge, which is necessary for fostering growth in a professional field. As such, researchers have the responsibility to communicate research results to the scholarly community. Both the reputation and the growth of a profession depend upon three key values: 1) openness in communication, 2) honesty in reporting results and methods, and 3) fairness in apportioning credit. All investigators are obligated to uphold these values.\nGuidelines:\nInclude sufficient information in publications to enable others to replicate the results or otherwise scientifically validate the research.\nAvoid simultaneous submission of the same abstract or manuscript to multiple journals.\nAvoid fragmentary publication or multiple publications of highly similar research findings based on the same data set.\nAcknowledge any sources of financial support for the research and disclose any conflicts of interest in publications.\nPEER REVIEW:\nPeer review is an essential part of the research process. Peer review helps ensure that research has been carried out in an effective manner and will make a significant, timely contribution to the field. Researchers of all fields may find themselves in the position to offer peer review, and the obligation should be thought of as an additional way to contribute to the profession. The review process must be conducted according to the highest professional standards to ensure continuing widespread confidence in the peer review system.\nGuideline:\nReview only manuscripts and grant applications on a subject matter of personal expertise and return a thoughtful review.\nDisclose real or perceived conflicts of interest. Identification of a conflict of interest may require a decision to remove oneself from the review process.\nBase a review objectively within the context of published information. Offer positively constructive comments rather than confrontational remarks.\nRetain the confidentiality of all manuscript and grant application contents, as both contain privileged information.\nCOLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:\nCollaborative research affords many opportunities to significantly expand research in response to more detailed questions by sharing expertise and resources. Researchers are encouraged to partake in collaborative research within the institution as well as across institutions, keeping in mind that all of the guidelines for research put forth are applicable to collaborative projects. Noncompliance by any single individual contributing to collaborative research may have negative repercussions for the entire research team.\nGuidelines:\nEnsure all those involved confirm their compliance with applicable regulations and policies of all institutions and professional standards.\nAbide by export control regulations that can place legal restrictions on the ability to publish or present.\nEnsure collaborators adhere to all grant management regulations and contractual obligations.\nDiscuss and agree to authorship guidelines for the project.\nAdvise collaborators of institutional policies for intellectual property and requirements for protecting privileged work invented in the course of the collaboration.\nDisclose all real or perceived conflicts of interest with collaborators prior to embarking on collaboration.\nFINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST:\nConflict of interest occurs when a researcher uses his\/her position,relationships, and reputation for personal gain or for the profit of a family member. Real or perceived conflict of interest can be detrimental to the research process in that it may lead some researchers to inappropriately influence a research study or results. The existence of a financial relationship does not necessarily lead to inappropriate actions. Consequently,it is important for researchers to disclose all relevant financial relationships. See University Policies IP06, HR91, and RP06.\nGuidelines:\nDisclose all potential significant conflicts of interest to:the University Conflict of Interest Committee prior to the submission of proposals or initiation of sponsored projects or at least annually or as changes in status occur.\nfunding agencies when submitting funding applications.\njournal editors when submitting manuscripts for publication or acting as a peer reviewer.\nmeeting organizers prior to delivering a scholarly presentation.\nthe Institutional Review Board, when applicable.\n\nAttempt to eliminate significant conflicts of interest and appropriately manage those that cannot be eliminated.\nCONFLICT OF COMMITMENT:\nConflict of commitment occurs when demands on time and\/or effort made by non-institutional entities or persons interfere with primary professiona lresponsibilities to the University. Avoiding irresponsible conflicts of commitment is essential for supporting credibility and accountability,providing sound stewardship of University resources, increasing trust among members of the University community, protecting researchers and the University from litigation, and for maintaining mission focus and academic freedom. The University allows and encourages extra-university research activities as long as such activities support the mission of the University and do not compete with the University. To avoid the appearance of unethical conflicts of commitment, researchers should disclose all potential conflicts to academic supervisors. See University Policy IP06.\nGuidelines:\nAttempt to effectively manage time and effort commitments that may detract from University obligations.\nDisclose all potential conflicts of commitment that arise from activities such as consulting, external teaching, privately-funded research, and start-up companies.\nFISCAL RESPONSIBILITY:\nAccurately managing research funds contributes to the fiscally sound and ethically responsible conduct of research. Managing project budgets and effort responsibly contributes to the legitimacy of the overall research project. See University Policies RA01,RA21, RA04, and\u00a0RA06.\nGuidelines:\nUnderstand that grants, contracts, and gifts are awarded to the University, rather than to individuals employed by the University.\nEffectively manage research-appropriated funds to ensure all costs incurred on a project are reasonable, allowable, and allocable.\nComply with all terms and conditions imposed by the financial sponsor.\nInitiate all required approvals for budgetary and programmatic changes that may be necessary during a project.\nComply with University purchasing and travel policies as well as all sponsor regulations.\nSubmit effort certifications for all projects annually, but review effort assignments monthly to avoid unallowed expenses for federally funded projects in particular.\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF RESEARCH SUPERVISORS:\nMentoring young researchers in the technical as well as ethical aspects of research is a significant responsibility. Research supervisors have the rewarding and unique opportunity to inform, instruct, and set an example for the responsible conduct of research. However, researchers should be cognizant of ethical issues related to the supervision of research trainees such as the potential abuse of power over those who are dependent for financial, academic,and emotional support; conflicts of commitment between the productivity of the supervisor's research and the trainee's academic progress; and financial conflicts of interest created by assigning research trainees to projects in which the supervisor stands to gain financially.\nGuidelines:\nEnsure the scientific integrity of all work stemming from one's research group.\nProvide supervision, guidance, and example to trainees to further their academic, technical, and professional development.\nProvide oversight of experimental procedures including study design and data collection, validity, reporting, and retention.\nInstruct graduate students, post doctoral fellows, and other research assistants on all relevant regulations, university policies, and university procedures for research with humans, animals, and\/or hazardous materials.\nEnsure the proper fiscal management and conduct of the project.\nOversee the preparation and submission of technical reports and any other required deliverables.\nRESEARCH WITH HUMAN PARTICIPANTS:\nThe conduct of research with human participants is highly regulated and is guided by ethical considerations. First and foremost, researchers should be cognizant of the fact that research with human participants is a privilege, nota right stemming from Academic Freedom. Researchers are obligated to conduct research with human participants in such a way as to minimize any risks or harm to participants. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval process is in place to ensure that all research with human participants adheres to this mandate. See University Policies RP03\u00a0and RA22.\nGuidelines:\nMinimize risk to participants and ensure that research is justified by maximizing potential benefits.\nObtain informed consent of participants throughout the duration of the research as appropriate.\nEnsure the safety and privacy of all participants, as well as the confidentiality of all information.\nEmploy additional safeguards when vulnerable populations are involved.\nObtain written IRB approval for research prior to contact with human participants.\nAdhere to all relevant federal regulations.\nRESEARCH WITH ANIMAL SUBJECTS:\nResearch involving animals must be humane and meet normative standards of conduct. Animal researchers are duty-bound to conduct their research ethically and humanely. Researchers should be cognizant of the fact that the use of animals in research is a privilege, not a right stemming from Academic Freedom. See University Policy RP04, Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals.\nGuidelines:\nEnsure all research associates working with animals are adequately evaluated according to the Animal Care and Use Occupational Health and Safety program, trained and supervised.\nIdentify how the research will benefit animals or human kind.\nMinimize the number of animals involved in a research study to include only the number necessary to ensure the integrity of the research.\nDesign protocols to avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain, using appropriate pain medication where appropriate.\nObtain written approval of research from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) prior to the commencement of any research or teaching with animals.\nAdhere to the IACUC-approved protocol throughout the study.\nConduct all research activities in accordance with University policy, the Animal Welfare Act, the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Teaching, Research, and Training.\nRESEARCH INVOLVING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS:\nResearch involving biohazardous, radioactive and other hazardous materials, such as chemicals, if, improperly handled, has the potential to pose a threat to researchers, the Penn State community, and society at large.Additionally, other potential safety hazards may exist in the research environment and measures need to be in-place to prevent injury or negative impacts. It is essential that an organizational structure for safety be established and followed so that safe processes are integral with daily activities.

See Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.51 (Grant agreement), 2 CFR 200.24 (Cooperative agreement), and 2 CFR 200.40 (Federal financial assistance).\nFederal Contract - The legal instrument issued by a Federal awarding agency under the Federal Acquisition Regulation to enter into a procurement relationship with a non-Federal entity. See FAR Subpart 1.1 (Purpose, Authority, Issuance).\nSubaward - The legal instrument issued to a lower-tier collaborator under a Federal Financial Assistance Award. The recipient of a subaward is called a Subrecipient.\nSubcontract - The legal instrument issued to a third party under a Federal Contract to perform a portion of the programmatic effort. The recipient of a subcontract is also called a Subrecipient.\nPurchased Services Contract \u2013 The legal instrument issued to a vendor to perform routine services. Such services are typically commercial and provided within the vendor's normal business operations. The recipient of a Purchased Service Contract is called a Contractor. (See Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.23 for further definition of Contractor. See BS17 \u2013 Use and Procurement of External Consultants for further definition of Purchased Services Contracts.)\nPOLICY STATEMENT:\nPenn State must make a case-by-case determination whether each agreement it makes for the disbursement of Federal program funds casts the party receiving the funds in the role of a Subrecipient or a Contractor. In general terms, Subrecipients are collaborators who contribute to programmatic decision making, whereas Contractors are vendors who provide routine services on a commercial basis. More guidance on this distinction can be found at Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.330.\nThe Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) issues Subawards to Subrecipients performing collaborative effort under Federal Financial Assistance Awards. OSP issues Subcontracts to Subrecipients performing collaborative effort under Federal Contracts. All such Subawards and Subcontracts must be requested through the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP), which is responsible for the negotiation of terms and conditions. (Note: The College of Medicine, the Applied Research Lab, and the Electro-Optics Center have been delegated authority to negotiate subawards and subcontracts on behalf of their respective units.) Prior to issuing a Subaward or Subcontract, OSP must perform a risk assessment to evaluate whether the proposed Subrecipient has the demonstrated ability to perform its portion of the work in compliance with federal terms and conditions. Once issued, Subawards and Subcontracts must be monitored by the Principal Investigator and the College Research Office in accordance with RAG80 \u2013 Subrecipient Monitoring. Additional guidance regarding the issuance, administration, and closeout of such agreements can be found in the following procedure guides:\n\"Procedures for the Administration of Subawards\" \u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Procedures for the Administration of Subcontracts\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPenn State sometimes issues Subawards and Subcontracts under non-Federal funds. Penn State applies the same basic procedures outlined above for such arrangements.\nPenn State Purchasing is responsible for the issuance of Purchased Services Contracts (via purchase orders). See BS09 for further guidance.\nEXAMPLES:\nExample 1: Penn State receives an NSF grant, which is a Federal Financial Assistance Award. The PI wants to collaborate with a researcher at Cornell University. Penn State must issue a Subaward to the Subrecipient (Cornell).\nExample 2: Penn State receives a DOE cooperative agreement, which is a Federal Financial Assistance Award. The PI wants to purchase services from a company. Penn State should issue a purchase order (through Purchasing) to procure the service.\nExample 3: Penn State receives a DoD contract, which is a Federal Contract. If the lower-tier recipient will be contributing to the programmatic work, Penn State will issue a Subcontract (through OSP). If the lower-tier recipient will be performing routine services on a commercial basis, Penn State will issue a purchase order (through Purchasing).\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\n CROSS-REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may have specific application and should be referred to, especially:\nBS09 - Initiating Purchases From Vendors Outside the University,\nBS17 - Use and Procurement of External Consultants, and\nRAG80 - Sub-Recipient Monitoring (Formerly RAG22)\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tPublished Date: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating parts of RA16 and RA19) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by the implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nOctober 31, 2013 - Changes have been made throughout the policy to reflect current operations, made in conjunction with an update to the Procedures for the Administration of Subawards.

The term \"essential functions\" does not include the marginal functions of the position. A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including but not limited to the following:\nThe function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function;\nThe function may be essential because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed; and\/or\nThe function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function.\n(d) Reasonable Accommodation\nA reasonable accommodation is any modification or adjustment to a job related activity, an employment practice, or the work environment that makes it possible for a qualified employee with a disability to perform essential job functions and to enjoy equal employment opportunities.\nA few examples of reasonable accommodations include:\nMaking existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.\nAcquiring or modifying equipment or devices, adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies, and providing qualified readers or interpreters.\n(e) Interactive Process\nThe interactive process is the informal confidential dialogue between the University and the employee to identify reasonable accommodation(s).\n(f) Undue Hardship Exception\nThe University is required to make a reasonable accommodation for a qualified employee with a disability if it would not impose an \"undue hardship\" on the operation of the University's business. Undue hardship (for University purposes) is defined as an action that would be unduly burdensome, or that would fundamentally alter the nature and structure of the operation or unit where the employee is currently working. The University is not required to lower quality or production standards to make an accommodation.\nPROCEDURE TO REQUEST REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION:\n(a) Making a Request for Reasonable Accommodation\nAn employee who wishes to request a reasonable accommodation (or another person wishing to request a reasonable accommodation on behalf of an employee) can choose to make the request in either of the following ways:\nComplete a  Reasonable Accommodation Request Form.\nContact the immediate supervisor, Human Resources Representative, or ADA Coordinator in the Affirmative Action Office. When a request is made verbally, employees seeking a reasonable accommodation should follow up the verbal request either by completing the Reasonable Accommodation Request Form or otherwise confirming their request in writing (email is acceptable) to the ADA Coordinator.\nThe Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or family member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this law, we are asking that employees and health care providers not provide any genetic information when responding to a request for medical information. 'Genetic Information' as defined by GINA includes an individual's family medical history, the results of an individual's or family member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual's family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.\n\u00a0\n(b) Determination of Disability\nAfter the initial request is made, a determination is made by the ADA Coordinator as to whether the employee has a disability as defined by applicable federal and state laws. The employee may be required to submit documentation to substantiate their request (see [d.] below). Submitted documentation will be confidentially maintained in a file separate from an employee's personnel file. The ADA Coordinator may consult with appropriate University representatives to determine if the condition meets the definition of disability as defined by applicable federal and state laws.\nIf the employee's condition is determined not to be a disability (as defined by applicable federal and state laws), the employee will be notified that their request is denied.\n(c) Interactive Process\nThe interactive process takes place after the employee's condition is determined to be a disability as defined by applicable federal and state laws.\nThe exact nature of the dialogue will vary. In some instances, both the disability and the type of accommodation required will be obvious, and thus there may be little or no need to engage in any discussion. In other situations, the University may need to ask questions concerning the nature of the disability and the individual's functional limitations in order to identify an effective accommodation. While the individual with a disability does not have to be able to specify the precise accommodation, he or she does need to describe the problems posed by the workplace barrier. Additionally, suggestions from the employee with a disability may assist the University in determining the type of reasonable accommodation to provide. Where the individual or the University are not familiar with possible accommodations, the University may consult with public and\/or private resources to help identify reasonable accommodations once the specific limitations and workplace barriers have been ascertained.\n(d) Documentation of Disability\nThe University may require that a request for a reasonable accommodation be supported by documentation. If required, the employee will be provided with a Request for Documentation of Physical \/ Mental Health Condition or Disability form. The employee may also be provided with information that identifies the essential functions of the position. The employee has the responsibility to submit this form and information to the health care provider. The employee also has the responsibility to ensure that the health care provider completes and returns the form to the University.\nAPPEAL PROCESS:\nIf an employee is dissatisfied with the decision reached by the ADA Coordinator, the employee may appeal to the Vice Provost for Affirmative Action (814-863-0471).\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR01 - Fair Employment Practices\nAD42 - Statement on Nondiscrimination and Harassment\nAccess and Disability Issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy outlines an employee's rights and responsibilities in accordance with Penn State's procedures for requesting a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990."},{"university":"psu","name":"bs11","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities after Initiating Purchases from Vendors Outside the University | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesResponsibilities after Initiating Purchases from Vendors Outside the University \n\n\n\nBusiness Services Policies\n\nBS11\nResponsibilities after Initiating Purchases from Vendors Outside the University\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssociate Vice President for Auxiliary & Business Services>\nContents:\nPurpose\nChange Orders\nFollow-Up\nDelivery Information\nReceipt Of Damaged Goods\nReturning Materials\nReimbursements\nFurther Information\n\n\nCHANGE ORDERS:\nThe Department of Purchasing Services has exclusive authority to change a Purchase Order. If such need arises, the Department of Purchasing Services should be contacted immediately.\nFOLLOW-UP:\nFollow-up on orders is not routine, but the Department of Purchasing Services will expedite delivery if requested to do so by the requesting department.\nDELIVERY INFORMATION:\nIn accepting delivery, it is the responsibility of the requisitioning department to inspect all purchases, including opening and checking of the contents. By confirming the invoice in the eBuy+ invoice confirmation system, the receiving department verifies receipt and acceptance of the items ordered. (See following paragraph for items received in a damaged condition.) If the items received are not per specifications, such as color, model, size, etc., the Department of Purchasing Services will contact the vendor after being notified by the receiving department.\nRECEIPT OF DAMAGED GOODS:\nMost quotations are solicited on a delivered basis to a designated University building. This places the responsibility for damages on the carrier and the shipper. An \"Inspection Report\" form and a \"Standard Form for Presentation of Loss and Damage Claims\" must be completed and presented to the carrier in order that the University may be reimbursed for loss or damage. All public carriers have these forms.\nWhen a shipment arrives with visible damage, all copies of the delivery receipt should be noted \"Received in damaged condition.\" A copy should be sent to the Department of Purchasing Services on the same day the material is received or services rendered. A second very necessary step, when damage is readily apparent at time of delivery, is to insist that the carrier's employee make out an \"Inspection Report.\" The \"Inspection Report\" and copies of the \"Standard Form for Presentation of Loss and Damage Claims\" should then be forwarded to the Department of Purchasing Services. Also, note in the eBuy+ invoice confirmation system that material is damaged and what resolution was made, if any.\nIf damages are discovered after signing the delivery receipt, the receiving department is to notify the carrier immediately, and request an inspection. After the carrier has made his inspection, the receiving department should forward the \"Inspection Report,\" and copies of the \"Standard Form for Presentation of Loss and Damage Claims\" to the Department of Purchasing Services.\nRETURNING MATERIALS:\nDamaged or incorrect items shall not be returned to a vendor without prior approval and instruction from the Department of Purchasing Services\nNo equipment is to be returned to a vendor for repair or adjustment without the prior approval of the Department of Purchasing Services.\nREIMBURSEMENTS:\nReimbursements received from vendors after the end of the fiscal year, for purchases paid in the prior fiscal year from general funds, will not\u00a0be credited to the budget of the department originating the purchase. This applies to all reimbursements, including those for duplicate payments, over payments, or returned materials.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\nEffective Date: March 18, 2011\n\tDate Approved: March 16, 2011\n\tDate Published: March 18, 2011 (Editorial changes- October 25, 2013)\nMost Recent Changes:\nOctober 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Generally, such chemicals are classified as explosives, compressed gases (flammable and nonflammable), flammable and combustible liquids, flammable solids, oxidizers, poisons, and corrosives. This does not include biohazardous materials (e.g., oncogenic viruses, recombinant DNA, infectious agents, or blood) or radioactive materials. Additional guidance is provided in Appendix A.\nChemical Inventory Management System (CHIMS)\u00a0- A centralized system coordinated by Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) to manage inventories of hazardous chemicals in use and storage.\nChemical Inventory Coordinator - The Environmental Health and Safety staff member who administers this program.\nDepartmental or Work Unit CHIMS Officer - An individual designated by the department or work unit to ensure compliance with this policy in those buildings occupied by the department or work unit.\nChemical Owner - The individual with primary responsibility for the hazardous chemicals. In research labs, this individual will usually be the principal investigator. In other work units (e.g., maintenance shops, art studios, instructional labs, etc.), this individual will usually be the director or manager of the unit. If the facility is shared among several faculty or staff, the department head may be designated as the chemical owner.\nSystem User - An individual who is authorized by the chemical owner to manage his\/her chemical inventory data in the CHIMS.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy applies to the use and storage of all hazardous chemicals that are used by University activities such as teaching, testing and research laboratories; agricultural operations; areas where large quantities of chemicals are stored; and maintenance shops.

The Director is the University's principal agent to make commitments for equipment, materials, goods and services.\nLimited delegation of purchasing authority has been made to several administrative units of the University because of their unique purchasing requirements.\nThese are:\nOffice of Physical Plant - (for construction contracts and the hiring of architects and engineers),\nHousing and Food Services - (for food and related supplies),\nUniversity Libraries - (for purchases of library collection materials- books, periodicals, reference tools, and online resources, such as journals and databases),\nThe Applied Research Laboratory - (for all purchases for their Federal government contracts),\nMultimedia and Print Center - (to manage the manufacture and procurement of printing, copying and addressing).\nAlso, by Agency Authority, the Purchasing Department at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center will accomplish the acquisition of equipment, materials, goods, and services for Penn State's College of Medicine.\nQuestions concerning any specific authority or delegation should be referred to the Director of Procurement and Materials Management.\nPROCUREMENT:\nIn order to insure appropriate expenditure of University funds, these general principles will be followed:\nAll funds deposited with the University, regardless of source, are considered University funds. Purchases of equipment, materials, goods and services using these funds must comply with established University purchasing policies and procedures.\nA properly executed eBuy+ Requisition  is the prime valid method of committing the University for the purchase of equipment, materials, goods or services. The resulting Purchase Order must be approved by the Director of Procurement or his\/her delegate. Faculty and staff, unless specifically authorized by the Board of Trustees, are not permitted to make a financial commitment on behalf of the University.\nNOTE 1: Due to their independent purchasing authority, Housing and Food Services, the Applied Research Laboratory, and the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center do not utilize the eBuy+ system and therefore do not use the eBuy+ requisition. \u00a0They utilize their unique requisitioning systems rather than the one designated above.\nNOTE 2: Material items and authorized services up to and including $2,000 (including delivery, shipping, or special handling, and excluding several specific classes of items) may be charged on the Penn State Purchasing Card. (See Policy BS14 and the Procedure PC2009 for more information about the University Purchasing Card.)\nNOTE 3: Delegation to acquire materials, goods or services up to $500, and equipment up to $250, has been granted to faculty and staff by using a properly approved Limited Order. (See Policy BS16). The Limited Order is available for limited use only if the purchasing card cannot be used.\nSee \"Exceptions\" below for other considerations.\n\nVendors which require contracts, equipment leases, or agreements in addition to or in place of a University Purchase Order, must have these documents approved by the Director of Procurement or other duly authorized Officer of the University.\nAny procurement transaction involving the expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, unless previously approved by the University Board of Trustees, must be approved by the President or the Treasurer of the University before execution of a Purchase Order.\nAll purchases of equipment, materials, goods and services (including consultants) shall be made in a fair and equitable manner. Competitive purchasing shall be defined in University written policies and procedures where the same serves the best interests of the University. (Refer to Policies BS09 and BS17.)\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nUniversity Purchasing Services is charged with the following responsibilities:\nComply with all policies of the Board of Trustees and Officers of the University governing the procurement of equipment, materials, goods and services.\nEnsure the procurement of equipment, materials, goods and services are accomplished according to established laws, University policies and proper ethical conduct.\nProcure the required equipment, materials, goods and services for the academic, administrative and research departments of the University in a fair and equitable manner.\nEnsure compliance with competitive purchasing requirements in accordance with written policies and procedures.\nAuthorize and sign Purchase Orders, contracts, leases or agreements for the procurement of equipment, materials, goods and services.\nNOTE: Refer to \"Contractual Documents\" for limitations.\nREQUISITION \/ PURCHASE ORDER:\nThe purchase requisition is initially prepared by the using department by completing an eBuy Requisition. After this initial preparation, the resulting Purchase Order serves as a requisition until it is approved by Purchasing Services.\nExceptions:\nThose expenses connected with travel must either be paid by the University employee, or on a Penn State purchasing card.\u00a0 Settlement of travel expenses must be done through the submission of a travel report in the Employee Reimbursement System (ERS).\nThose items which are available from General Stores are obtained through eBuy+ .\nThose items which are available from other departments of the University are obtained by using the Interdepartmental Charges and Credits form (IBIS \"IDCC\"), direct billing (see Procedure CR2069), or the University Purchasing Card (also refer to Policy FN16 and #5, below).\nThose items which are permitted to be purchased with petty cash or operating funds.\nThose items authorized to be acquired by using a validly issued University Purchasing Card. (See Policy BS14 and Procedure PC2009.)\nThose items which are permitted to be purchased with the Limited Order.\nThose types of contractual documents requiring additional approval by any one of the University officials specified in Policy FN11 and authorized by the Board of Trustees to commit the University. If a Purchase Order is also required to accompany these documents, the package must be processed through Purchasing Services for approval before it goes to other University Officials.\nCONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS:\nThe following guidelines have been established for the signing of certain contracts by Purchasing Services:\nIf the contractual document includes a \"Non-Funding Clause,\" Purchasing Services can sign regardless of the time period involved. A \"Non-Funding Clause\" is one which releases the University from the contract in the event its annual appropriation from the Commonwealth is not forthcoming.\nAll non-financial contractual documents (such as volume buying agreements and other similar contracts) which do not obligate the University to any specific commitment can be signed by Purchasing Services.\nIf the contractual document or purchase order calls for pre-payment of a multi-year obligation (payment for services for more than 12 months) which exceeds $50,000 per year or $100,000 in total and there is a no cancellation clause, \u00a0the budget executive for the unit will be contacted and provided the amount of prepayment and the terms (i.e. no cancellation), who the original requestor was for follow-up, and will be asked for their acceptance of all inherent risks involved, including potential for paying for services that will not be used in the future.\nFinancial Officers would be responsible for assuring that appropriate accruals are posted for proper accounting in the University's financial records.\nIf the contractual document covers a period in excess of 12 calendar months, and is in excess of $50,000, the document must be forwarded to the Assistant Treasurer by Purchasing Services for an additional approval signature.\nSee Policy FN11 and Financial Guideline No. 2 (FNG02) for the overall University policy on Contracts and Leases.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST:\nAll employed or associated with the University have an obligation to disclose all outside financial relationships which have any potential for a real or perceived conflict of interest for the University.\u00a0 There are several types of conflicts which can arise, including conflict of commitment, research conflict of interests and individual and institutional conflict of interest.\u00a0 More detail on conflicts of interest and commitment can be found on the\u00a0University Ethics site. This policy addresses conflicts of interest related to the procurement of equipment, materials, goods and\/or services, by any procurement process (Purchase Order, Purchasing Card, Special Request for Check and\/or related contracts\/agreements).\nEmployees must disclose to his\/her budget executive all outside financial interests that have a potential for a real or perceived conflict of interest, which includes ownership interest of 10% or more in any business held by the employee, spouse\/partner and\/or children, including their children\u2019s spouses\/partners and\/or income received by engaging in outside professional services or private consulting with a business\u00a0 (each an \u201cemployee-related business\u201d).\u00a0 In these situations, any unit (administrative areas) to which the employee has a direct or indirect reporting line shall not make any purchases of equipment, materials, goods, or services from the employee-related business, except as outlined in number 2 below.\nIn unusual circumstances, if the employee-related business is offering unique goods or services that cannot be obtained elsewhere, it may be possible to use the employee-related business in the unit.\u00a0 However, a full disclosure of the outside financial interest must be made in the sole source justification of the purchase order or as a back-up documentation for other procurement methods, and the employee cannot be involved in any discussion, decisions or approvals of the transaction or make any assessments of the goods or services provided. The employee and the budget executive must approve use of the employee-related business.\nNOTE:\u00a0 This applies for procurement of goods and services for research awards and sub-contracts as well.\u00a0 The employee with the financial interest must complete a formal disclosure through the\u00a0COINS\u00a0system, per\u00a0RP06\u00a0- Disclosure and Management of Significant Financial Interests (Formerly RA20,\u00a0Individual Conflict of Interest)\u00a0.\n\nUniversity personnel, by policy, must decline personal gifts or gratuities associated with the procurement process, including the purchasing card.\nAccording to Board BYLAWS, Article #6, the University may not enter into any contract or transaction of $10,000 or more with any organization in which a current or emeritus member of the University Board of Trustees (or any member's spouse or minor child) holds a beneficial ownership (10% or greater) unless the contract has been awarded through an open and public bidding process, in accordance with University purchasing policy, or has been fully disclosed to the Board of Trustees and approved by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Trustees\u00a0before\u00a0the Purchase Order is initiated.\u00a0 (\"Fully disclosed\" shall mean disclosure of the material facts as to the relationship or interest of the member or members of the Board of Trustees, or spouse or minor child of such member or members, and disclosure of the material facts as to the contract or transaction, including a Sole Source Justification.)\nMembers of the Board of Trustees shall also comply with Board BYLAWS Article #6 and, in connection therewith, shall, to the extent possible, avoid person-to-person discussion or negotiation with the officers and employees of the University for the purpose of procuring business with the University.\u200b\u200b\nNOTE:\u00a0In order for the Trustees to authorize University transactions of $10,000 or more, the Trustee whose business is impacted must present to the Board the situation and conditions surrounding the transaction that may result in a possible conflict of interest.\n\nEMERGENCY DECLARATION:\nIf an emergency is declared at any University location by the Senior Vice President for Finance & Business or pre-determined delegate, general purchasing regulations, including competitive bidding requirements, may be suspended to address the emergency response and other purchasing decisions.\u00a0 The period of emergency will begin when declared and will end when stated by the Senior Vice President for Finance & Business.\nDuring an emergency, the Director of Procurement, or if unavailable, the pre-determined delegate, can activate and raise goods and services limits on existing purchasing cards as required to address purchases required to continue operations during the state of emergency.\nTITLE AND OWNERSHIP:\nThe title to and ownership of all equipment obtained at the University by purchase, through a funded project or grant, or by gift, is vested in and remains the property of the University upon the completion or expiration of the project or assignment. No property or equipment shall become the personal property of any individual unless obtained through the Salvage and Surplus Operation. (Refer to Policy BS15.)\nPURCHASE FOR EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PERSONAL USE:\nIt is the policy of Purchasing Services of The Pennsylvania State University not to permit any buying through the University's purchasing procedures for the personal use of any faculty, staff member or student; or for organizations other than those recognized departments who have University budgets against which purchases may be charged.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual may apply, especially:\nBS09 - Initiating Purchases from Vendors Outside the University,\nBS15 - Disposal and Purchase of Obsolete, Surplus or Scrap University Owned Equipment, Supplies and\/or Materials,\nBS16 - Limited Order,\nBS17 - Use and Procurement of External Consultants,\nFN11 - Contracts and Leases,\nFN16 - Interdepartmental Transactions,\nFNG02 - Limited Delegation of Contract Approvals, and\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest.\nEffective Date: February 18, 2013\n\tDate Approved: February 13, 2013\n\tDate Published: February 18, 2013 (Editorial changes, June 13, 2016)\nMost Recent Changes:\nJune 13, 2016 - Editorial change in the PURPOSE section.

Responsibility\nExecutive guidance for the Privacy interests addressed by this policy and related guidelines of both the University and those individuals whose private data has been entrusted to its care shall be vested in the Executive Vice President and Provost.\nII. Specific Categories of Information\nThe below are data use constraints related to certain types of data collected, processed, stored, or published by the University.\nEMAIL ADDRESSES - E-mail addresses appearing on University web sites are published for the sole purpose of facilitating private, individual communication between University personnel and readers. The University will not distribute, sell, or otherwise transfer addresses on its website or online services to non-affiliated parties or individuals. The University reserves the right to use internal search functions to obtain specific email addresses for normal business operations. Information such as email addresses may also be displayed in online directories accessible by the general public, unless requested otherwise (see AD11, University Policy on Confidentiality of Student Records and HR58, Employee Office Address and Telephone Number Information).\nINFORMATION COLLECTED FOR SERVICE PROVISION \u2013 On occasion, the University may collect information from and about users to synchronize systems or update the experience between the user and Penn State.\u00a0 Penn State will not sell, trade, or share the information collected per the University\u2019s Web Privacy Statement. Information collected will be used solely for the purpose for which it was intended.\u00a0\nSOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN) AND PENN STATE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (PSU ID) \u2013 A Penn State Identification Number (PSU ID) will be assigned to all students and employees of the University as the primary identification number for University purposes. The PSU ID shall be unique to the individual and is a lifetime assignment used for multiple and changing relationships with the University. For more information on the PSU ID, refer to University Policy AD97.\nAs a matter of University policy, and except as may be required by applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations, it is prohibited that, and in no case shall, any SSN be used as an identifier in a University hosted or developed system or applications, or transmitted electronically, unencrypted. SSNs and\/or PII must only be used to accomplish legitimate University business needs or requirements. SSNs will only be requested and required in certain cases, such as when required by law or for business purposes with certain third party providers.\nAll records containing PII will be classified, at a minimum, as \u201cHigh\u201d pursuant to AD95 and must be secured appropriately. \u00a0Other data elements not specifically classified as PII but that can otherwise be used to distinguish or trace an individual\u2019s identity (e.g. Date of Birth) must be classified, at a minimum, as \u201cModerate\u201d pursuant to AD95, unless an exception is approved by the Chief Privacy Officer, privacy@psu.edu and\/or the Chief Information Security Officer, security@psu.edu.\u00a0 (See Policy AD95, Information Assurance and IT Security and corresponding standards).\nDisposal of the records must be done securely, and in accordance with Policy AD35, University Archives and Records Management.\nHEALTH INFORMATION - Individuals have rights with respect to the privacy and security of their health information under Federal and state laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"). These rights are outlined in University Policy AD22, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nINFORMATION COLLECTED FROM UNIVERSITY'S WEBSITE \u2013 Information collected on the University's website is governed by the University's Web Privacy Statement.\nELECTRONIC SECURITY SYSTEM INFORMATION - Access by University units and individuals to information gathered, processed, and archived through electronic security systems (e.g., card or other facility access systems, alarm systems, video surveillance systems) shall occur only in accordance with Policy AD65, Electronic Security and Access Systems.\nIII. Data Protection and Data Loss Prevention\nIn order to protect \"High\" or \"Restricted\" data entrusted to its care (See Policy AD95, Information Assurance and IT Security and its corresponding standards), the University reserves the right to monitor its networks to detect and respond to externally or internally generated attacks upon its systems, subject to the constraints of this Policy.\nPROTECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII) \u2013 All systems that house certain types of information classified as \"High,\" such as PII, are subject to the Pennsylvania Data Security Breach Notification Laws, (PA Statutes, Title 73, Ch. 43, \u00a72301 -2308, 2329) and\/or other applicable data breach notification laws. University systems classified as High and Restricted must be scanned appropriately to identify PII using University approved scanning procedures. Users of University systems shall utilize the results of required scanning to facilitate proper handling of any and all PII identified.\nUniversity approved scanning procedures will be developed to identify stored PII to facilitate proper handling. Users are responsible for remediating (i.e., securely removing, redacting) unauthorized instances of PII on their systems. If, however, the scanning identifies PII that also is subject to a litigation hold, please contact the Office of General Counsel before remediating. Subject to the constraints of this Policy regarding authorization, the University also reserves the right to perform automated checks to detect and respond to the possible exfiltration of PII over its computer networks. Periodic security scans for PII will be administered to detect unauthorized instances of PII, when necessary. Deliberate failure to remediate unauthorized instances of PII may result in disciplinary action. Please see the following resource for specific guidance and direction as to current University approved scanning procedures.\nSpecific details on the permitted use, storage, and transmission of PII, as defined in this Policy, can be located in the below Standard:\nPII Standard\nThis Standard will be enforced in the same manner as this Policy.\nVENDOR CONTRACTS \u2013 In the event that a unit, department, or individual seeks to enter into a contract that involves PII, that particular unit, department, or individual is responsible for ensuring that adequate and appropriate safeguards and contractual provisions are in place relating to the collection, access, use, dissemination, and\/or storage of this PII before entering the contract.\u00a0 Moreover, before a unit, department, or individual enters into a contract that involves the use of PII, that unit, department, or individual must (1) notify and consult every other unit or department across the University involved, either directly or indirectly, about the necessity for PII in the performance of the contract, (2) seek approval from every other unit or department across the University whose interests in or records of PII may be disclosed or utilized in performance of the contract, and (3) seek approval from the Privacy Office. The applicable safeguards shall be documented in writing in an appropriate manner to ensure compliance.\nIMPLEMENTATION AND EXCEPTIONS\nAny questions regarding the content of this Policy or supplemental Guidelines and Standards should be referred directly to the Chief Privacy Officer (privacy@psu.edu) who has responsibility to interpret.\u00a0\nPOLICY VIOLATIONS\nFederal, state, and\/or local governments have enacted various laws and regulations relating to privacy to which the University is bound.\u00a0 Compliance with this Policy is designed, in part, to ensure that the University is complying with its various privacy-related obligations.\nTo the extent any violation of this Policy results in, leads to, or is responsible for a reportable incident or penalties imposed by government regulators or agencies, then that specific department or unit operating in violation of this Policy may be required to cover all University costs associated with the resulting reportable incident and\/or associated government penalties.\nUniversity employees or students who violate this Policy and\/or supplement Guidelines and Standards may be subject to disciplinary action.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Privacy Office.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially:\nAD11, University Policy on Confidentiality of Student Records\nAD22, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nAD35, University Archives and Records Management\nAD65, Electronic Security and Access Systems (formerly SY33)\nAD83, Institutional Financial Conflict of Interest\nAD95, Information Assurance and IT Security\nAD96, Acceptable Use of University Information Resources\nHR60, Access to Personnel Files\nRA02,\u00a0 Addressing Allegations of Research Misconduct (Formerly RA10, Handling Inquiries\/Investigations Into Questions of Ethics in Research and in Other Scholarly Activities)\nRP07, HIPAA and Research at Penn State University\nMost recent changes:\nMay 30, 2018 - Updates include incorporating a Standard, the adoption of the Privacy Principles, updates to language on PII scanning, addition of sections on Implementation and Exceptions and Policy Violations, and retiring ADG08.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\n\nSeptember 18, 2017 - Editorial changes and updates to the definition of PII.\n\n\nFebruary 22, 2016 - Major changes to the entire document to reflect the reorganization of University privacy policies.\n\nAugust 1, 2007 - Changes to POLICY section.\nAugust 28, 2003 - Significant rewrite emphasizing the balance between privacy issues and the need to observe state and federal laws and University regulations.\nFebruary 22, 2000 - New Policy.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nMay 30, 2018>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nMay 30, 2018>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nMay 30, 2018>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish a framework for compliance and responsibility regarding privacy and the protection of an individual's personal information."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr48","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision of Child Care | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesProvision of Child Care \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR48\nProvision of Child Care\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: March 18, 1993\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: September 1, 2017\nContents:\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nRequirement for University-managed or Contracted Childcare Centers\nHandling Medical Emergencies\nMedication Administration\nAdministrative Oversight\nSupervision of Children\nReporting Suspected Child Abuse\nBackground Checks\nAllegations of Inappropriate Conduct\nFurther Information\nCross Reference\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS:\nChild - A person under the age of eighteen (18).

The University Photo Identification Credential would contain the individual's photo, name, and, most likely, other unique identity elements, such as a PSU ID number, card number, and\/or departmental information. In addition to the visual elements, the University Photo Identification Credential may include data stored in a digital form that can be interfaced with automated systems. Data may be stored on a magnetic stripe, embedded memory, or other technology. Cards that are issued for door access and food service meal plans, which do not include photos or information unique to an individual, are not considered photo identification credentials and are not covered by this policy.\nThe Penn State id+ Card is the official photo identification card of Penn State. All id+ cards are photo cards with a magnetic stripe on the back. Only authorized University ID Offices are permitted to produce and issue id+ cards.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR ISSUANCE OF PHOTO IDENTIFICATION CREDENTIALS:\nThe Penn State id+ Office has central authority over the issuance of any University-issued photo identification credentials. It is the goal of this policy to minimize, reduce, and ultimately eliminate the practice of issuing multiple University-issued photo identification credentials to the same person. Toward that end, whenever possible, the Penn State id+ Card, as the official University identification card, shall be used for photo identification credential purposes. Any department wishing to issue photo identification credentials must be authorized to do so by the id+ Office.\nThe production of all University photo identification credentials shall employ person identity information from the Penn State Central Person Registry (CPR) which, under University Policy AD80, is the University's \"sole authoritative source\" for person identity information. The photo used for the Penn State id+ Card will be stored in the CPR, as part of the Person Biographical Record (Person Bio Record), under practices and procedures developed under the authority of IAM Governance by the cross-unit Person Bio Record working Group. The id+ Office is the data steward for the digital photo images.\nTYPES OF id+ CARDS:\nThere are six types of Penn State id+ Cards:\nStudent id+ Cards - This card is issued to students during their scheduled New Student Orientation visit, or to students who have consented to the terms and conditions of the Student Financial Responsibility Agreement and are enrolled in LionPATH for one or more classes at any Penn State campus at the time of card issuance. World Campus students are issued non-photo identification credentials, which may be exchanged free of charge for an id+ card by visiting any of the campus' University ID Offices.\nFaculty\/Staff id+ Cards - This card is issued to full-time employees (standing, fixed-term or supplemental) and postdoctoral appointees of the University.\nFaculty\/Staff\/Student id+ Cards -This dual-status card is issued to full-time employees (standing, fixed-term or supplemental) of the University, who are also enrolled in LionPATH for one or more classes at any Penn State campus at the time of card issuance and have consented to the terms and conditions of the Student Financial Responsibility Agreement.\nRetiree id+ Cards - This card is issued upon request to full-time employees (standing, fixed-term or supplemental) of the University who have retired with benefits.\nEmeritus id+ Cards - This card is issued in lieu of the Retiree id+ card to retirees with Emeritus rank upon request of the retiree.\nAffiliate id+ Cards - This card is issued to individuals with the following affiliations:\nWage Payroll\nAdjunct Appointees\nVisiting Professors\nVisiting Scholars\nInterns\nBoard of Trustees\nIf an administrative area has an affiliation other than those listed that requires an id+ card, that area must contact the University Park id+ Office, 814-865-7590, for authorization to issue an affiliate card.\nThe Penn State Hershey Medical Center issues a special version of theid+ card to employees and students of the College of Medicine. The governing body for these ID cards is the Hershey Medical Center Security Department at(717) 531-8521.\nid+ CARD ISSUANCE:\nAll Penn State id+ Cards are issued by the ID-issuing office located at each University campus. The first card is issued at no charge.\nOne of the following forms of valid photo identification must be presented to obtain an id+ card:\nState Driver's License\nPassport\nUS Military ID\nState-issued Photo ID\nGovernment-issued Photo ID\nPermanent Resident Card\nHigh School ID and Social Security Card\nCollege ID and Social Security Card\nID Office personnel will verify card eligibility based on enrollment and\/or employment status in University systems at the time of card issuance. Newly-hired employees and affiliates must also present an Authorization for Penn State id+ Card form, obtained from their area Human Resource representative.\nThe nine-digit PSU ID number will be displayed on the id+ card. It is the cardholder's responsibility to safeguard the confidentiality of the PSU ID number. If an assigned PSU ID has been compromised and used fraudulently, the cardholder should contact the id+ Office immediately.\nThe photo for the id+ card is stored digitally and may be used for other approved academic and administrative purposes at Penn State. The photo is not considered directory information and will not be made public.\nAll id+ cards remain the property of The Pennsylvania State University and are non-transferable.\nUSE OF THE id+ CARD:\nPenn State id+ Cards should be carried on campus at all times. Presentation of the card may be required to access University services, such as meal plans, library services, admission to events, and building access. Access to University facilities or cardholder's account(s) may be denied if an account is suspended by the University for administrative reasons, deactivated by the cardholder, or if the card's magnetic stripe is damaged.\nOnly the cardholder may be in possession of the id+ card. Cards will be confiscated and destroyed if presented by someone other than the cardholder or if the card is involved in inappropriate or illegal use. Cardholders who have had their id+ card confiscated and are eligible for a replacement id+ card will be charged the currently-approved replacement fee. Fraudulent use of the card or violations of University policies and procedures when using the card may result in disciplinary action.\nTampering with id+ cards and\/or making color reproductions is prohibited. Labels or stickers may not be added to any of the cards since their presence would interfere with the electronic reading of the card. Punching holes (for hanging, etc.) and burning (branding) is also prohibited.\nid+ cards may not be collected and held as collateral for the temporary use of equipment, services, etc.\nid+ cards may be used for appropriate educational discounts and admission to facilities at other institutions. Additional uses of the card and information on the services and optional programs associated with the id+ card may be found on the id+ website at www.idcard.psu.edu.\n id+ CARD REPLACEMENT:\nIn order to prevent unauthorized use and charges, it is the individual's responsibility to report a lost or stolen id+ card. If an id+ card has been lost or stolen, it must be deactivated immediately online at\u00a0www.idonline.psu.edu or by calling814-865-7590 during business hours. When a card is deactivated, the cardholder's residence hall access, meal plan access, and LionCash+ account will automatically be suspended. To suspend other features, such as those offered by PNC Bank or other departmental systems, the cardholder must contact the appropriate office.\nCardholder's may obtain a replacement card by visiting their campus ID-issuing office with proper identification. An updated photo will be taken each time a new card is issued. There is no charge for replacing non-functioning id+ cards that exhibit normal wear and tear. Cardholders will be charged the currently-approved replacement fee for lost, stolen, or damaged id+ cards.\nIf an individual's name or status changes (e.g., from Employee to Retiree or from Student to Faculty\/Staff) a new id+ card may be requested. There is no charge for the updated id+ card if the previous id+ card is given in exchange at the time of issuance. Valid identification must be presented when requesting a name change.\nUSE OF DIGITAL PHOTOS:\nThe digital images used to produce photo identification credentials are not considered directory information and the use of the photos is governed by FERPA and other applicable University policies.\nRequests for access to the digital images for purposes other than creating photo identification credentials must be made in writing and approved by the Manager of the University Park id+ Program.\nOne-time Access to Individual Digital Images \u2013 Requests for single digital images can be made only by authorized offices.

and\nbe granted to appointees who recently were awarded a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate (e.g., Sc.D, M.D., D.D.S., J.D.) in an appropriate field; and\nprovide the appointee with training under the supervision of a senior scholar or a department; and\ninvolve substantially full-time research or scholarship; and\nbe viewed as preparatory for a full-time academic and\/or research career; and\nprovide the appointee with the freedom to meet the expectation of publishing the results of her or his research or scholarship during the period of the appointment.\nDESIGNATED TITLES:\nDesignated titles for postdoctoral appointments at The Pennsylvania State University are Postdoctoral Fellow and Postdoctoral Scholar. The title of Postdoctoral Fellow will be used only in connection with appointments financed under a Postdoctoral Fellow Program of a granting agency outside the University. The title of Postdoctoral Scholar will be the usual designation for all other postdoctoral appointments.\nLENGTH OF APPOINTMENT:\nNormally, the initial appointment and renewals are not longer than a six-year period at Penn State, with exceptions granted to meet specific training needs of an individual and only after careful review by the college and appropriate central administrative officer.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR CLEARING APPOINTMENT:\nAll postdoctoral appointments will be approved by the appropriate dean and the Office of the Vice President for Research will maintain a current inventory of all appointments.\nSALARY:\nPostdoctoral scholars and fellows should be paid at least the minimum annual salary as noted each July 1.\nINSURANCE BENEFITS:\nPostdoctoral Scholars and Fellows may enroll in an available University-sponsored health plan effective with the date of appointment. Those who enroll will contribute for an available University-sponsored health plan on the same basis and at the same rates as regular faculty and staff member contributions. Such contributions will be deducted monthly.\nIn addition, Postdoctoral Scholars and Fellows may enroll in the University's dental and\/or vision plan.\nPostdoctoral Scholars and Fellows may elect to participate in the Age-graded Life Insurance Plan and elect an amount of coverage equal to their annual stipend.\nSee the website at http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/offices\/office-of-postdoctoral-affairs\/postdoc-benefits for coverage details.\nLEAVES OF ABSENCE:\nWhen a postdoctoral scholar or fellow is unable to perform the duties of the position, the four weeks of leave provided by a 48-week appointment can be used to account for the absence. In addition, the department may be able to provide for some work to be done at home (e.g., data analysis), permitting the scholar or fellow to remain in pay status.\nLeaves without pay for a reasonable period of time should be considered if they would not inhibit the applicable research project(s).\nGuidance for leaves of absence can be sought from the Office of Human Resources Work\/Life Office(814-865-9346).\nBefore a leave of absence is discussed with a foreign national scholar or fellow, the supervisor needs to contact the International Scholars Office (814-865-0423) to insure consistency with federal regulations.\nSee also the new parent guideline at http:\/\/forms.gradsch.psu.edu\/current\/newparentaccomodationguideline.pdf.\nAPPOINTMENTS:\nIBIS Forms \"GFSA\" for appointments, and \"GRAD\" for changes and reappointments, must be completed in accordance with the approval paths established by your Financial Officer. Postdoctoral Scholars and Fellows should receive an appointment letter outlining the details of their appointment.\nGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE:\nPostdoctoral fellows or scholars should always attempt to resolve problems concerning their professional situation by discussing the matter with their supervisor.If there is a reason for the postdoctoral fellow or scholar to believe that this avenue is inappropriate, he or she may seek recourse through the department or division or program head, or from the associate or assistant dean of their college or division. The fellow or scholar may also seek advice from the college or division ombudsman.\nOccasionally, there are disagreements between postdoctoral fellows\/scholars and their supervisors that cannot be resolved in the administrative structure of the department, division, program or college. Such problems may involve alleged violations of academic freedom, professional ethics, and procedural fairness and consistency. There may be disagreements concerning authorship credit or intellectual property ownership. If a resolution of such problems cannot be achieved at the department, division, or program level, the following procedures are to be followed. If for some reason the proper jurisdiction is not clear, then the Vice President for Research shall decide on the appropriate procedure.\nFor disagreements that are unresolved at the department or program level, a grievance process will be initiated when the postdoctoral scholar or fellow files a written grievance with the dean of his or her college. The parties to the grievance process shall be the person(s) filing the grievance and the person(s) responsible for the act or omission that gave rise to the grievance.\nIn response to the grievance, the College Dean appoints and convenes a Hearing Committee consisting of five members. From that time until the hearing ends, the College Dean refrains from involvement in the dispute. The Hearing Committee consists of two postdoctoral scholars or fellows, two faculty members, and an administrator who will serve as chairperson. All members of the Hearing Committee will be from outside the academic department or unit in which either the postdoctoral scholar or faculty member who is involved in the grievance participates.\nEach party is allowed up to three disqualifications from this committee without cause.An indefinite number of disqualifications is allowed with cause, as determined by the College Dean. The College Dean makes additional appointments as necessary to fully staff the Hearing Committee.\nThe Hearing Committee attempts to resolve the disagreement within 30 calendar days of receiving the complaint.\nThe hearing is not public. During the hearing, either party may have present an adviser, who must be a postdoctoral scholar\/fellow, faculty, or a staff member of the University.In light of the nature and spirit of the proceeding, representation by legal counsel is prohibited.\nThe Hearing Committee may have present at the hearing such assistance as it deems necessary.\nThe Hearing Committee is not bound by strict rules of evidence and may admit any relevant evidence.\nThe hearing is audio recorded, and a recording of the hearing is kept though any appeal processes. The parties involved my request to listen to the tape and take written notes until it is destroyed, however, copies are not provided.\nThe parties are afforded an opportunity to obtain necessary witnesses and documentary and other evidence. The department or program involved makes all reasonable efforts to cooperate with the committee in securing witnesses and making available documentary and other evidence.\nEach party has the right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses. Expenses incurred in obtaining a witness will be the responsibility of the party requesting the witness.\nThe Hearing Committee\u0092s findings are based solely on the hearing record. In cases where issues involve authorship, the Hearing Committee should adhere to the spirit of Policy RA13.\nThe Hearing Committee submits its findings and recommendations in writing to the College Dean and to the parties involved. Based solely on the record of the hearing, the College Dean may endorse all, part, or none of the Hearing Committee\u0092s recommendations. In coming to a decision, the College Dean may consult with the Vice President for Research. A written notice of the decision of the College Dean is provided to the Hearing Committee and the parties involved within three weeks of receipt by the College Dean of the Hearing Committee\u0092s recommendations. If the College Dean does not endorse all of the findings and adopt all the recommendations of the Hearing Committee, an explanation will be included in the written notice. The decision by the College Dean shall be final, but does not preclude existing independent avenues of appeal (e.g. Faculty Rights and Responsibilities). The record of this decision, along with supporting documents, shall be submitted to the Office of General Counsel and the Vice President for Research and kept by the Vice President for Research for not less than five years from the date of the resolution of the complaint.\nAfter the final decision, all efforts should be made to reconcile the situation within the research group. In the rare case where irreconcilable differences exist even after the resolution, and where the decision is made against the faculty member, it will be the responsibility of the College Dean to find another similar position in the University for the postdoctoral fellow or scholar, and, if necessary, to provide bridge funding for this position for up to six months.\nTAX-DEFERRED ANNUITIES:\nRetirement savings options available to Postdoctoral Scholars and Fellows are limited to contributions to either a Traditional or Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA).Traditional IRAs offer the opportunity to reduce federal taxable income, subject to IRS limitations, when federal income tax returns are filed. IRA enrollment and payments options are done on an individual basis and are unrelated to University benefit programs.Traditional and Roth IRAs are available from insurance companies and mutual fund companies as well as most banks.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nPolicy IP02\u00a0Coauthorship of Scholarly Reports, Papers and Publications\nhttp:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/offices\/office-of-postdoctoral-affairs\/benefits-for-postdoctoral-scholars\nUPDATES:\n3\/29\/2010 - Revised to add \"Office of General Counsel\".\n1\/1\/10 - The title Senior Vice President for Research was changed to Vice President for Research.\n4\/8\/08 - Link to new parent guideline included.\n1\/1\/08 - Updated Insurance Benefits section.\n11\/2\/06 - Changed Vice President for Research to Senior Vice President for Research.\nSeptember 29, 2003 - Leaves of Absence section added.\nAugust 1, 2002 - Responsibility for Clearing Appointment section revised.

Reduced compensation and responsibility normally occurs in increments of 15 to 25%. Staff participants will continue to accumulate sick, vacation, and holiday time according to their reduced work commitment.\nThe Penn State defined contribution retirement plan administered by TIAA-CREF has been amended to allow participants of the phased retirement program the option to begin accessing retirement accumulations prior to full retirement. A balance of 1% must be maintained in an individuals retirement account during phased retirement. It is important that a participant consider the tax implications (if any) of accessing retirement funds.\nThe provisions described in Item 2 above are only available to participants in the defined contribution retirement plan administered by TIAA-CREF. (Participants who are members of the State Employee Retirement System (SERS) cannot withdraw retirement funds from SERS until full retirement is commenced.)\nParticipants will continue to receive contributions to their retirement plan based on their reduced service and salary. Those who are members of the SERS will earn reduced service credit in proportion to the percent reduction in work commitment. TIAA\/CREF members contributions will be based on their reduced salary.\nThe minimum amount of time a participant can be in the phased retirement program is 12 months with a maximum not to exceed 3 years. Normally, programs start on July 1 and end on June 30.\nParticipation in the program by a faculty or staff member must be reviewed and approved by the department head or manager and dean or administrative officer. Approval should take into consideration such issues as department capacity to support the request, both academically and financially, and department and college\/administrative unit strategic planning.\nThe program is to be operated within the approved budget for each college or administrative unit.\nBecause the program must operate within each college or administrative unit's budget, it may not be possible for the dean or administrative officer to approve all phased retirement proposals for a given year. If a proposal is not approved for a given year, it may be re-submitted in a subsequent year.\nOnce approved for the program, agreement to participate is irrevocable and may not be rescinded at a future date. Full retirement will commence at the agreed upon date that designates the end of the phased retirement period. A participant may accelerate the retirement date during phased retirement; however, the final retirement date may not be delayed unless an extension is approved. If at the end of the phased retirement period, the participant is eligible to retire from the University with health benefits, the phased retirement may be extended with the Dean or Chancellors agreement and approval. Extensions must be reviewed and approved annually.\nHealthcare, dental, vision, life insurance, and ADD benefits and long-term care are retained during the phased retirement at the regular, employee contribution rate. In addition, LTD coverage will be continued based on the reduced salary.\nSuspension of the program will not affect participants already in the program.\nPROCEDURE:\nIndividuals interested in exploring a phased-retirement program should begin by initiating discussions with their department head\/manager and their Human Resources Representative.\nThe applicant must complete a Phased Retirement Application and Agreement and submit it with a written proposal for phased retirement to his\/her department head or manager approximately 2 to 6 months prior to the intended start date of the program. The proposal should include, but not be limited to, such items as starting date; length of the phased retirement program; the percent of reduction in the work responsibilities in each year of the program (and the corresponding reduction in compensation); the type of work assignments in each year; and the perceived benefit of the program to the department and college or administrative area.\nAfter the proposal is approved by the participant, the department head\/manager, and the dean\/administrative officer, the Phased Application and Agreement and a copy of the written proposal shall be forwarded to the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee for final processing. For academic appointments, the application and proposal must be submitted to the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, who will then forward the information to the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee for final processing. The Office of Human Resources will forward a copy of the completed and processed application to the participants Human Resources Representative.\nUpdates:\nJune 14, 2016 - Added \"or designee\" to the Procedure section.\nJuly 11, 2012 - Added extension provision.\nApril 28, 2011 - Extensive revisions.\nJanuary 26, 2011 - Added \"or designee\" throughout policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The Voluntary Phased Retirement program is intended to meet the needs of a faculty or staff member who would like to transition into full retirement and still provide service to the college\/administrative unit in fulfilling its objectives. The program allows a faculty or staff participant to have a gradual work commitment reduction over a defined period of time at a reduced compensation level. A reduction may be in such activities as teaching, student counseling, administrative duties, research lab duties, or number of projects. Voluntary Phased Retirement should enhance succession planning and the mentoring of junior faculty and staff members as more senior faculty or staff members transition from strategic roles in the University."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad32","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoking Policy and Guideline | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesSmoking Policy and Guideline \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD32\nSmoking Policy and Guideline\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nUnder Review>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nPolicy\nDefinition\nImplementation\nEnforcement\nOffice\/Administrative\/General Work Area\nOpenly Assigned: Classrooms, Laboratories, and Seminar\/Meeting Rooms\nVisitors\n\nReview\n\n\nPOLICY:\nSmoking of any material is prohibited in all University facilities, at all locations, including University-owned vehicles.

The faculty member shall, therefore, give no less than four months' notice of resignation.\nA faculty member of this University may inquire into, and consider the acceptance of, an appointment elsewhere at any time and without previous consultation with his\/her supervisors. It is agreed, however, that if a definite offer follows, he\/she shall not accept it without giving such notice as is indicated in the preceding provision. He\/She is at liberty to ask his\/her superior officers to reduce, or waive, the notification requirements there specified, but is expected to conform to their decision on these points.\nFor faculty members who teach, it is expected that such resignation from employment shall be effective at the end of a fiscal year. Thus, in any particular year, the final date for tendering a resignation for a faculty member who teaches is March 1, to be effective June 30.\nFOR STAFF EMPLOYEES:\nStaff employees should give adequate notice prior to the effective date of resignation.

There are many considerations in determining if a budget can be realigned, including departmental and college restrictions. Agency or sponsor regulations are the prime determinant if realignment is permitted and within what parameters. PIs must refer to the award terms and conditions before making changes to the original awarded budget.\nSPONSOR PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS:\nThe Principal Investigator or Project Director (PI\/PD) of a sponsored project is required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of the individual award. All such reports or requests must be processed through the Office of Sponsored Programs and countersigned by an authorized official of the University. Additional guidance related to federal grants and cooperative agreements can be found below:\nPer the Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans:\nThe approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share (see \u00a7200.43 Federal share) or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. It must be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.\nRecipients are required to report deviations from budget or project scope or objective, and request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.\nFor non-construction Federal awards, recipients must request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the following program or budget-related reasons:\nChange in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).\nChange in a key person specified in the application or the Federal award.\nThe disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.\nThe inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with Subpart E\u2014Cost Principles of this part or 45 CFR part 75 Appendix IX, \"Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Awards and Contracts with Hospitals,\" or 48 CFR part 31, \"Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,\" as applicable.\nThe transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs as defined in \u00a7200.75 Participant support costs to other categories of expense (See RA22 \u2013 Participant Support Costs)\nUnless described in the application and funded in the approved Federal awards, the subawarding, transferring or contracting out of any work under a Federal award, including fixed amount subawards as described in \u00a7200.332 Fixed amount subawards. This provision does not apply to the acquisition of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.\nChanges in the approved cost-sharing or matching provided by the non-Federal entity. No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless an exception has been approved by OMB. See also \u00a7\u00a7200.102 Exceptions and 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval).\nThe need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.\n\nNOTE: No other prior approval requirements for specific items are to be imposed by Federal agencies upon universities unless a deviation has been approved by OMB. However, PI\/PD's are advised to review carefully the terms of the specific grant award and the agency's guidelines prior to making any changes to the budget or program plans.\nEXPANDED AUTHORITIES:\nFederal agencies are authorized to waive prior approval requirements associated with pre-award costs (incurred up to 90 days prior to the begin date of a new award), no-cost extensions (up to 12 months following the end date of an award), and carry forward of remaining balances to subsequent periods of performance. Please note that not all agencies waive these prior approval requirements. It is important to check the specific requirements associated with your federal award. For more information, see Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.308(d).\nADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS:\nPer Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans:\n(e) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for Federal awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds the Simplified Acquisition Threshold and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency cannot permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation.\n(f) All other changes to non-construction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (c) of this section, do not require prior approval (see also \u00a7200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval)).\nPI\/PD's are instructed to consult the terms of their award and the agency's guidelines in order to ascertain their agency's policy regarding these additional restrictions or limitations.\nCONSTRUCTION AWARDS:\nGuidance related to construction awards (and awards involving both construction and non-construction) can be found at 2 CFR 200.308(g).\nFORMAT OF BUDGET REVISIONS:\nPer Uniform Guidance \u00a7200.308 Revision of budget and program plans:\n(h) When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in the application, unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.\nAGENCY REACTION TO REQUEST:\nPer Uniform Guidance \u00a7200.308 Revision of budget and program plans:\n(i) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the Federal awarding agency must review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency must inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may apply, especially:\nRA22 - Participant Support Costs\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating old RA04) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 24, 2010 - Revised the FEDERAL DEMONSTRATION PARTNERSHIP section, clarifying information and links.\nMarch 7, 2005 - Editorial changes to correct links.\nFebruary 20, 1998 - (Reformatted for GURU from OSP, dated September 1994.

Participant support costs are intended to support students and other trainees. Participant support costs may not be paid to individuals providing administrative or logistical support, individuals attending the conference as invited speakers or research subjects participating in a study.\nPer the Uniform Guidance:\nParticipant support costs means direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with conferences, or training projects (2 CFR 200.75).\n\u00a0\nParticipant support costs are allowable with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency\u00a0(2 CFR 200.456).\nParticipant support costs are excluded from MTDC (2 CFR 200.68), thus F&A is not assessed on participant support costs (unless the budget is being calculated on a TDC or Total Cost basis.) There is no special object code associated with participant support costs, since such costs can be associated with travel, stipends, registration fees, etc. Thus, it is generally necessary to establish separate accounts, one for the participant support costs (assessed 0% F&A) and one for all other costs.\nThe federal government also expects participant support costs to be accounted for separately. According to the Uniform Guidance, grantees must request the Federal awarding agency's prior approval before transferring funds budgeted for participant support costs to other categories of expense (2 CFR 200.308(c)(5)). As a result, unused participant support costs are generally returned to the sponsor rather than spent on other categories of cost.\nHistorically, participant support costs have been associated most commonly with the National Science Foundation (especially Research Experience for Undergraduates grants (REUs) and Research Experiences for Teachers grants (RETs)). Please refer to\u00a0NSF's Grants Proposal Guide, Chapter II, section\u00a0C.2.g.(v)\u00a0for NSF specific guidance.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nRAG22 - Guidelines for Participant Support Costs\nEffective Date: March 10, 2017\n\tDate Approved: March 9, 2017\n\tPublished Date: March 10, 2017\nMost recent changes:\nMarch 10, 2017 - Edits have been made to the POLICY section to better define what participant support costs are, and for what\/whom they may be expended.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by the implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish the requirements that apply to participant support costs."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy23","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Program for Animal Care Personnel | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesOccupational Health and Safety Program for Animal Care Personnel \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY23\nOccupational Health and Safety Program for Animal Care Personnel\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nReference\nApplicability\nPolicy\nResponsibilities\nTraining\nEnforcement\nReporting and Treatment of Illnesses, Injuries or Accidents\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\n\nREFERENCE:\nThe Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, latest edition (Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources), Occupational Health andSafety in the Care and Use of Research Animals (NRC) and the Guide for the Care and use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Experimentation andTeaching, latest edition (Federation of Animal Science Societies) describe the requirements for an Occupational Health and Safety program.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy applies to any University employee (faculty, staff, and student, both wage payroll and work-study), volunteer, or visitor who works with vertebrate animals and\/or tissues, fluids, secretions, and excretions from vertebrates. The policy also applies to those who handle cages and related equipment contaminated by animal tissues, secretions, and\/or excretions.\nParticipation in the Occupational Health and Safety Program is not required for students whose only exposure to animals is in a classroom setting.However, the instructor must inform the students about any health risks associated with the species with which they will be working. For example, students working with birds in a classroom setting shall be informed about psittacosis; students working with sheep shall be informed about Q fever.Instructors are responsible for providing this information.\nVolunteers and students are required to follow all safe work practices and visitors must be made aware of animal-related hazards before they enter the premises. Facility supervisors are responsible for providing this information.\nA risk-based assessment of all persons involved in animal care is conducted to determine their level of participation in the Occupational Health and Safety Program. This assessment considers the nature and duration of exposure, hazards posed by the animals and materials used, and susceptibility of personnel. This assessment includes a review of information provided on the completed Animal Worker Questionnaire by EHS and OHS staff and on-site evaluations by EHS staff to evaluate work practices, use of personal protective equipment, and other safety-related factors associated with animal care activities.\nPOLICY:\nAll persons involved in animal care and service shall participate in the Occupational Health and Safety Program. This program includes an assessment of risks associated with the employee's (employee in this context refers to any person involved in the care of animals or research utilizing animals, as outlined in the Applicability: section above) animal-related duties and types of animals involved and their working conditions, as well as an assessment of their potential medical predisposition to animal related health risks. Preventive medical procedures and health monitoring tailored to the employee's risks, training in animal health related issues, and implementation of appropriate safety measures is also included to help minimize risks.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nBudget Executives and Budget Administrators shall ensure that all supervisors enroll all regular employees and student employees who are identified as \"at risk\" in the Occupational Health and Safety Program. In addition, they shall ensure that job descriptions accurately reflect the types of animal-related activities expected of the employee, the animal species with which the employee will have direct or indirect contact and conditions in the job that may affect the health of the employee. Performance of these functions will ensure compliance with applicable state and federal health and safety rules, regulations, standards, and procedures.\n\t\t\u00a0\nSupervisors (department chairs, faculty and other employees with direct oversight of University employees or students) will ensure that each employee under their supervision who is identified as \"at risk\" will participate in the Occupational Health and Safety Program.\n\t\tNew employees who are at risk will be offered an initial baseline occupational health exam, and will also be offered periodic medical surveillance, as prescribed by OHS. Any employee who chooses not to participate in this program must sign a declination statement.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe ORP is responsible for ensuring that individuals who have direct or indirect contact with animals used for research, teaching, or demonstrations are enrolled in the Occupational Health and Safety Program. ORP will coordinate transfer of information between OHS, EHS, and the IACUC, which is responsible for ensuring an appropriate Occupational Health program is in place and for conducting a review of the program as it pertains to animal use. The IACUC requires that all employees (faculty, staff, student employees) who are associated with a research or teaching activity involving animals are enrolled in the Program before approving their participation in the activity. All Penn State University individuals listed on an IACUC application will be required to complete the Animal Worker Questionnaire and Occupational Health Education Certification. ORP will maintain training records and all Animal Worker Questionnaires and Occupational Health Education Certifications.\n\t\t\u00a0\nEHS will review the Animal Worker Questionnaire completed by the animal worker. EHS will conduct appropriate evaluations, discussions, and\/or site visits to ensure appropriate health and safety practices are in-place. Recommendations for occupational health and safety will be provided to the Supervisor\/Principal Investigator, Unit Safety Officer, ORP and IACUC Chair, for implementation by the responsible animal resource director, principal investigator or supervisor. The completed Questionnaire and recommendations will be forwarded to OHS for further review.\n\t\tEHS will maintain training records for individuals attending risk-specific training provided by EHS staff.\n\t\t\u00a0\nOHS will review the employee's Animal Worker Questionnaire, medical history and the risk assessment provided by EHS to ensure the appropriate level of risk associated with the animal contact and use and the medical suitability of the employee for the demands of the position. OHS will prescribe risk-specific preventive measures, health monitoring to reduce animal related risk, and maintain all employee medical records. OHS shall also alert employee and supervisors to extraordinary animal-related risks due to medical conditions. OHS will forward the completed form with recommendations to the supervisor and ORP.\n\t\tMedical histories, physical examinations, immunizations and laboratory tests may be required at periodic intervals, as determined by OHS.\n\t\t\u00a0\nEmployees, students and visitors shall report all unsafe conditions, practices or equipment to the supervisor, instructor or Safety Officer whenever deficiencies are noted.\nTRAINING:\nAll individuals working with vertebrate animals shall participate in an on-line training program through ORP. Individuals identified through the Occupational Health and Safety Program as \"at risk\" shall also attend supplemental risk-specific training.\nENFORCEMENT:\nThe IACUC, through its responsibilities listed above, will ensure enforcement of this policy. Research or teaching activities that involve individuals who are at increased risk but who are not enrolled in the Occupational Health and Safety Program may be interrupted or terminated at the discretion of the Committee.\nREPORTING AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESSES, INJURIES OR ACCIDENTS:\nAll injuries, illnesses or accidents shall be reported immediately to the employee's supervisor in accordance with policy SY03 (students) or SY04 (employees). Injuries or illnesses that occur in visitors or volunteers shall be reported in accordance with SY05.\n\t\t\u00a0\nPersons injured on the job at University Park during normal business hours must report to the Occupational Health Services, 3rd floor Centre Medical Sciences Building, 1850 E. Park Avenue. After hours, persons with job-related injuries that require immediate medical attention should report to the nearest emergency room. Job-related injuries that occur after hours, and that do not require immediate medical attention should be reported within 24 hours to OHS. Those who are injured at other University campuses should seek medical care from the designated health care provider as directed by OHS.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAll employee, student or visitor accidents, injuries or illnesses will be investigated promptly by the supervisor. Appropriate corrective measures to prevent reoccurrence shall be implemented.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially:\nRP04\u00a0- Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals\nSY01 - Environmental Health &Safety Policy\nSY03 - Emergencies Involving Students\nSY04 - Employee Accidents - Reporting and Investigation\nSY05 - Persons, Other Than Students or Employees, Who Are Injured or Become Ill on University Property\nSY24 - Use of Biohazardous Materials in Research and Instruction\nEffective Date: July 17, 2003\n\tDate Approved: July 2, 2003\u00a0\n\tDate Published: July 17, 2003 (Editorial changes- June 18, 2014)\nMost Recent Changes:\nJune 18, 2014 - Editorial changes.

Violations of authorial integrity, including plagiarism, invasion of privacy, unauthorized access, and trade secret and copyright violation using University Computer and Network Resources are prohibited. Computer software protected by copyright is not to be copied from, into, or by using University Computer and Network Resources, except as permitted by law or by the license or contract with the owner of the copyright.\nComputer networks and computer programs that facilitate and enable locating and downloading digitized works have made possession of copyrighted material such as music files, videos and software easier than ever before. In many cases, however, possession and\/or distribution of such files is in direct violation of state and federal laws, and University policy. The University regards such copyright offenses very seriously. System users must remove any copyrighted materials that they do not have the copyright holder's specific permission to possess. As noted above, they must not place such material on University systems or to personally-owned systems attached to the University network at any time and must not engage in unauthorized copying, transmission, distribution and\/or downloading of such works. System users are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the copyright holder has granted permission to make or distribute the copy in question. Suspected misuse of copyrighted materials by system users may result in exercise of the University's investigatory rights with or without notice to the user, suspension of network or other account access and disciplinary sanctions as defined in this policy. Additionally, the system user may face civil or criminal action that could result in fines, imprisonment or both upon conviction.\nThe Technology Education and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act modifies and clarifies the ways in which copyrighted material may be used without permission of the copyright owner. Faculty and Instructors (in this policy, all references to Faculty include Instructors)are protected under the TEACH Act only if they are in compliance with the new requirements. Such requirements include:\nThe materials are lawfully made and acquired.\nFaculty will not interfere with technological controls within the materials they want to use.\nThe materials are specifically for students enrolled in a class, and only those students will have access to the materials. The class is part of the regular offerings of Penn State.\nThe materials are directly related and of material assistance to the course, and under the control or actual supervision of the instructor.\nFaculty will include a notice on the materials that the materials are protected by copyright.\nFaculty will use technology that reasonably limits the students' ability to retain or further distribute the materials.\nFaculty will make the materials available to the students only for a period of time that is relevant to the context of a class session.\nFaculty will store the materials on a secure server and transmit them only as permitted by this law.\nFaculty will not make any copies other than the one needed to make the transmission.\nThe materials are of the proper type and amount the law authorizes: Entire performances of non-dramatic literary and musical works; Reasonable and limited parts of a dramatic literary, musical, or audiovisual works; Displays of other works, such as images, in amounts similar to typical displays in face-to-face teaching.\nMaterials specifically marketed for classroom use for digital distance education are NOT protected under the TEACH Act.\nNote: For full information about the TEACH Act and the principles of fair use, see: http:\/\/tlt.its.psu.edu\/teach-act\/\nEXEMPTIONS WITHIN COPYRIGHT LAW:\nCopyright Law includes several provisions that, in certain cases, offer the public in general, and educators in particular, exceptions to the need to seek permission. Understanding and making appropriate use of these provisions can help to further the educational mission of the University.\nFair Use:\nFair Use is legally defined in US Code Title 17, Section 107 to provide exceptions to the owners\u2019 exclusive rights \u201cfor purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research.\u201d\u00a0 Section 107 further states:\n\u201cIn determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\nThe purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature, or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\nThe nature of the copyrighted work.\nThe amount and substantiality of the portion of the work used in relation to the work as a whole.\nThe effect of the use in question upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.\"\nWhile the law gives no particular weight to any of these four factors, courts have tended to heavily rely on the fourth factor when reviewing legal challenges to fair use.\nSome groups and communities have attempted to clarify \u201cfair use\u201d by providing specific formulas or guidelines for the third factor, i.e., on the amount of a work that can be copied for instructional use.\u00a0 However, the law does not rely on any such formulas and relying on them without considering the other three can result in declaring a use out of bounds when it may in fact be allowed under fair use.\nFair use analyses can be conducted by anyone, but faculty may wish to make use of services listed below to help them with such an analysis.\n\"The Teach Act\":\nUS Code Title 17 Section 110, sometimes known as \u201cThe Teach Act,\u201d provides University personnel acting in an instructional capacity with specific rights for performance of copyrighted works in both the classroom and in an e-learning context.\u00a0\u00a0 This section does not exclude applying a fair use analysis in that context.\nExemptions to the \"Digital Millennium Copyright Act\":\nUS Code Title 17 Section 1201 sometimes referred to as \"The Digital Millenium Copyright Act,\" makes it illegal to disable or circumvent technological controls preventing copying or distribution of copyrighted works.\u00a0\u00a0 Section 1201 directs the Librarian of Congress, in consultation with the US Register of Copyrights, to periodically rule on specific exemptions to this prohibition that would facilitate a \u201cnon-infringing\u201d use of copyrighted material.\u00a0 These exemptions sometimes apply to educational settings and uses of copyrighted materials, but are reviewed and updated every three years. University personnel are advised to consult the services listed below to assist them in understanding if and how these exemptions may apply to them.\nSERVICES TO ASSIST WITH COPYRIGHT AND INSTRUCTION:\nThe Multimedia & Print Center, which operates a Copyright Clearance Office to assist University personnel by seeking and obtaining permissions to reprint materials for sale in course packs, seminars, and conference materials.\nThe University Libraries, which operates Course Reserves Services to assist University personnel by preparing materials for online course reserves and, where necessary, seeking permission and paying fees associated with copyright permissions.\nThe University Libraries and Information Technology Services, which further assists by conducting workshops, developing training and informational materials, and being available to discuss specific cases to help faculty, students and staff understand how the law applies to them.\nREPORTING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:\nThe senior position for computer and network security reporting to the Vice Provost for Information Technology is designated to receive notices of possible copyright infringements occurring online at The Pennsylvania State University.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research l.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nIP04 - Royalty Payments for Course Materials\nEffective Date: April 2, 2013\n\tDate Approved: April 1, 2013\n\tDate Published: April 2, 2013 (Editorial changes- November 19, 2015)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 19, 2015 - Editorial changes.

\n\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: May 10, 1994\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: June 1, 2004\nContents:\nPurpose\nDefinition\nAmount of Time Paid Off\nRelease From Teaching Responsibilities\nProcedure\nCross References\n\n\nDEFINITION:\nPaid parental leave for faculty is defined as the period of time a faculty member is relieved of all responsibilities while receiving full salary.\nA leave with salary does not mean that the faculty member will be required to carry more than a normal load before or after the leave. A faculty member must not be required to \"make up\" for a paid leave.\nAMOUNT OF PAID TIME OFF:\nThe total amount of time off (with and without salary) available to faculty is dependent upon a variety of factors and is outlined in the policies referenced below. The intent of this guideline is to state the minimum\u00a0amount of paid time off available to the faculty following the birth or adoption of a child in order to support the family needs of the faculty member.To retain as much flexibility as possible:\nNo maximum time limits are provided herein.\nIt is understood that a faculty member may wish to request a paid parental leave which is not as long as the minimum to which she or he is eligible.\nFor those faculty who accrue vacation time, personal holidays, or compensatory time off, such accrued paid time off is to be used as applicable rather than this guaranteed paid parental leave.\nLeave Following The Birth of a Child: Upon request, a leave shall be granted following the birth of a child. During such leave, full salary shall be continued:\nFor at least two weeks within three months of the birth of the child by the faculty member's partner.\nFor at least six weeks immediately following the birth of the child by the faculty member. This guideline is to be used in arranging for a paid parental leave barring any unforeseen medical circumstances. This guideline does not address situations for which medical leave is required before the birth of a child if the woman faculty member cannot, for any medical reason, carry out her responsibilities, or situations that necessitate extended paid medical leave due to complications that may arise during or following the birth of a faculty member's child. Situations that require extended leave due to illness or disability are to be handled in the current collegial manner, by discussion and arrangement with the faculty member's administrative head.\nLeave Following The Adoption of a Child: Upon request, a leave shall be granted following the placement of a child with the faculty member for adoption. During such leave, full salary shall be continued:\nFor at least six weeks immediately following the placement of the child with the faculty member.\nIf the adopting parents are both members of the faculty, they are eligible for a total combined paid parental leave of at least eight weeks.\nRELEASE FROM TEACHING RESPONSIBILITIES:\nIn addition to the paid parental leave for female faculty members following the birth of a child, a tenured or tenure-eligible woman has the option to either take a leave of absence without pay or to be relieved of classroom and classroom-related teaching responsibilities at full pay during the semester of the birth. In special circumstances, depending perhaps on the timing of the birth, the semester free of teaching might follow the one in which the actual birth occurs.\nTenured or tenure-eligible faculty adopting a child will receive a semester free from teaching within a year of the adoption. If the adopting parents are both members of the faculty, they are eligible for a combined period of one semester free from teaching immediately following the placement of the child with the family.\nFaculty members who have chosen to be relieved of teaching responsibilities at full pay are expected to pursue scholarly work, student advising, research and other professional service, including departmental and University service, as appropriate and in keeping with reasonable expectations for flexibility, for the period of the semester that does not involve paid leave.\nArranging teaching replacement throughout the semester is the responsibility of the department head or other appropriate academic administrator.\nThe University and its colleges expect that faculty members giving birth or adopting children will routinely use this benefit. Use of this benefit shall not adversely affect the faculty member's standing or salary in any manner. Moreover, use of this benefit does not restrict faculty members and their department heads from making further personalized arrangements as necessary and appropriate. The reduction in teaching is not meant to be made up at a later date.\nThe funding for the teaching reduction is provided by the college.\nPROCEDURE:\nAny child care policy must allow for some flexibility in its implementation. Department heads and other unit administrators should bear this in mind when working out individual arrangements and should consult with their deans as appropriate. They must be familiar with the policies and options for faculty giving birth or adopting a child and need to ensure that this information is provided to all faculty members in the department. Those situations involving care for infant children not specifically addressed by this policy can be considered on an individual basis.\nIn order to make any needed administrative accommodations for a parental leave, a faculty member should make her or his request for parental leave as soon as the date of the anticipated birth or adoption is known. If a faculty member has any ideas about administrative accommodations for their parental leave, they should share them with their administrative head as soon as possible. In the event of an unknown adoption date, a faculty member should inform her or his administrative head of the possibility of needing to request a parental leave at short notice. Contingency plans can then be discussed.\nArrangements for parental leave are to be made between a faculty member and her or his administrative head and reported simultaneously to the Provost and to the Vice President for Human Resources. If the faculty member and the administrative head cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement regarding the paid leave, the advice and guidance of the Provost should be sought to resolve any disagreements on the issue.\nIn the interest of departmental harmony and avoidance of hard feelings toward\u00a0the faculty member on parental leave, care should be taken in the distribution of the workload among the remaining members of the unit. The administrative head of the unit involved should consult, as soon as possible, with members of the unit about coverage of duties during the period of leave. While parental leave for faculty is not identical to sabbatical leave, the manner in which coverage of duties is distributed can be drawn from sabbatical leave examples. Creative solutions may be called for in small departments or when a very specialized course needs to be taught.\nA faculty member in the tenure provisional period may apply for a staying of the tenure provisional period as described in HR23, Promotion and Tenure Procedures and Regulations.Such an application is not in any way connected to these paid parental leave guidelines.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther policies should also be referenced, especially:\nHR16 - Leave of Absence Without Salary\nHR23 - Promotion and Tenure Procedures and Regulations\nHRG07 - Absence From Work Resulting From Pregnancy or Childbirth\nHRG11 - Family and Medical Leave\nand\nLife Events Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The University is committed to helping faculty balance the often conflicting demands of acclimating newly born or adopted children into the family with professional responsibilities. Toward this end, this guideline provides for paid parental leaves for Standing, Fixed-term I, and Fixed-term Multi-year faculty as well as release from teaching responsibilities for tenured and tenure-eligible faculty following the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption with the faculty member. It is the intent of this guideline to provide consistency throughout the University community in granting paid parental leaves (and workload accommodations) without limiting any flexibility held by faculty and administrative heads."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad54","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Page Design and Image | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesWeb Page Design and Image \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD54\nWeb Page Design and Image\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nSubject Matter Expert:\u00a0\n\n    Joan Scholton,\n    814-867-1344,\n    \n      sjs22@psu.edu    \n\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nPolicy\nRequired Common Elements\nThe Primary Penn State University Mark\nThe Entity Mark\nStandardized Search Element on All Pages\nSite Directories, Required Links and Contact Information\nImplementation\n\nAccessibility\nRecommendations and General Guidelines\nOversight\nFuture Monitoring\nCross References\n\n\nPOLICY:\nAll publicly accessible Penn State Web pages presenting official University information must adhere to the requirements below.

If so related, such gifts must be listed as a project in COINS.\n\"Senior or Key Personnel\" means the project director or principal Investigator and any other person identified as senior or key personnel in the grant application, progress report, or any other report required to be submitted by law or regulation.\n\"Significant Financial Interest\" (\"SFI\") means an FI consisting of one or more of the following interests of the Investigator (and those of the Investigator's spouse or partner and dependent child(ren)) that reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator's Institutional Responsibilities:\nFor publicly traded Entities, if the value of any Remuneration received from the Entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure combined with the value of any Equity Interest of the Investigator in the Entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000.\nFor non-publicly traded Entities (including but not limited to private \"start-up\" companies, closely held corporations, partnerships or sole proprietorships), if either:the value of any Remuneration received from the Entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or\nthe Investigator holds any Equity Interest (i.e., there is no de minimis amount for Equity Interests in a non-publicly traded Entity) in the Entity;\n\nIncome from intellectual property rights and interests (e.g., patents, trademarks, copyrights) that exceeds $5,000 in the previous twelve months; or\nAll reimbursed or Sponsored Travel exceeding $5,000 from an Entity in the twelve months preceding disclosure; however, travel that is reimbursed or sponsored by a federal, state, or local government agency in the United States, an American institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an American academic teaching hospital, an American medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an American Institution of higher education does not need to be disclosed as an SFI.\nThe term SFI does NOTinclude the following types of FI:\nsalary, wages, or other compensation for work\u00a0paid by the University\u00a0provided that the remuneration was not routed to the University by an Entity and intended for the Investigator at the direction of the Investigator in order to avoid disclosure as required by this Policy;\nincome from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles;\nincome from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by a U.S. federal, state, or local government agency, an American institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. \u00a71001(a), an American academic teaching hospital, an American medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an American institution of higher education; or\nincome from service on advisory committees or review panels for a federal, state, or local government agency in the United States, an American institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. \u00a71001(a), an American academic teaching hospital, an American medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an American institution of higher education.\n\"Sponsored Travel\" means travel that is paid for on behalf of an Investigator and not reimbursed to the Investigator directly.\nIMPLEMENTATION:\nA. Disclosure:\nInvestigators shall disclose all SFI (i) prior to the submission of an application for Research funding, (ii) at least annually and (iii) within thirty (30) days of the discovery or acquisition (e.g., through purchase, marriage, or inheritance) of a new SFI. Disclosures of reimbursed or Sponsored Travel shall include the following details:\nPurpose of the travel;\nIdentity of the sponsor or source of reimbursement;\nDestination;\nDuration of the travel; and\nAmount of Sponsored Travel or reimbursed travel, if known by the Investigator.\nAll disclosures shall be made by completing the financial disclosure form on the University's electronic Conflict of Interest System (\"COINS\"). All SFI must be disclosed prior to an application for Research funding when the proposed Research is related to the SFI (see below for more information on relatedness to Research) and when required by the funding agency (see generally 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.605(a) \u2013 (b))). This requirement for prior disclosure applies to all Investigators, including principal investigators, project directors and any other person who is responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of the Research. Thus, all Investigators should disclose in a timely manner according to this Policy so they do not delay the submission of funding applications.\nAll disclosures submitted are first routed electronically by COINS to the Investigator's department\/unit head for review. If the Investigator has no SFI to disclose, then his\/her disclosure will bypass department\/unit head review and be electronically routed directly to the COIO. Department\/unit heads may view such disclosures within COINS but need not review them. Once department\/unit head review, if required, is completed all disclosures will be electronically routed by COINS to the COIO.\nDisclosures made under this Policy shall be reported by the University to governmental agencies or to the general public as required by law or regulation.\nB. FCOI Review and Determination\nThe COIO shall be responsible for (i) the review of all SFI disclosed in order to determine whether the SFI is related to Research and (ii) if so related, referral to the Committee in order to determine whether the SFI is a FCOI, unless the Committee has delegated its authority to the COIO to make this determination.\n(1) Related to Research: An SFI will be deemed to be related to Research if the SFI could be affected by the Research or is in an Entity or individual whose financial interest could be affected by the Research. The COIO may seek the input of the Investigator and\/or his\/her department\/unit head in the determination of whether the SFI is related to Research.\u00a0\u00a0NOTE: For help in determining whether a gift is related to an SFI, see the Gift Questionnaire.\u00a0\nThe COIO shall refer SFI disclosures related to Research to the Committee for review and determination of whether an FCOI is present; provided, however, that the Committee is authorized to delegate to the COIO its authority to determine whether an SFI constitutes an FCOI, and in the event the Committee has delegated that authority to the COIO through specific guidelines set forth in a Standard Operating Procedure, the COIO may determine whether the SFI constitutes an FCOI without referral to the Committee.\n(2) FCOI Determination: The Committee or the COIO, under authority granted by the Committee, shall determine whether the SFI could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct or reporting of related Research. If the Committee or COIO shall find that an FCOI exists, then it shall also determine whether the FCOI shall be managed or eliminated prior to the expenditure of funds for the related Research.\nIf, in the course of on-going Research, an Investigator who is new to the Research discloses an SFI or an existing Investigator discloses a new SFI, then the COIO or Committee shall review the SFI, make an FCOI determination, as provided in the previous paragraph and, if the SFI is determined to constitute an FCOI, implement an FCOI Management Plan (see Section C below) within sixty (60) days of the date of the disclosure. If, in the course of on-going Research, an Investigator discloses an SFI that was not disclosed in a timely manner as required by this Policy (see Section A above), the COIO or Committee shall review the SFI, make an FCOI determination, as provided in the previous paragraph and, if the SFI is determined to constitute an FCOI, implement an FCOI Management Plan (see Section C below) within sixty (60) days of the date of the disclosure. See Noncompliance Section below for more details on failure to properly disclose according to this Policy.\nIf human participants are involved in the Research related to a SFI, the Committee also shall determine whether the SFI will adversely affect the protection of participants. If the Committee has determined that the SFI will adversely affect the protection of human participants, then disclosure to potential participants or the public cannot be used as the sole method of FCOI management (see Section C below).\nC. FCOI Management Plans:\nThe Committee or COIO shall document its FCOI Management Plan, which shall specify the actions that have been, and\/or shall be, taken to manage the FCOI. The Investigator's input regarding what actions should be included in the FCOI Management Plan shall be considered by the Committee or COIO. Examples of conditions and restrictions that may be imposed to manage an FCOI, either as a single condition or restriction, or as a combination of conditions and restrictions, and on either an interim or permanent basis include, but are not limited to:\nPublic disclosure of the FCOI (e.g., in public presentations or publications of the related Research);\nDisclosure of the FCOI to human participants, if applicable;\nAppointment of an independent monitor capable and willing to take appropriate measures to protect the design, conduct and reporting of the Research against potential bias resulting from the FCOI;\nIn instances in which students are involved in the Research, given the educational mission of the University, taking steps, to the extent possible, to protect the students' academic progress, intellectual property interests, and welfare (e.g., appointment of an independent monitor);\nModification of the Research plan;\nChange of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualification of personnel from participation in all or a portion of the Research, including interim disqualification of personnel from the Research between the date of disclosure and the completion of the University's review of the matter;\nReduction or elimination of the SFI (e.g., sale of an equity interest); or\nSeverance of the relationship giving rise to the FCOI.\n\nWhen a Gift from an entity in which the Investigator holds an SFI is used to support University Research, a management plan may require a third party, e.g., department\/unit head, to oversee or control the gift funds.\n\nThe COIO shall communicate to the IRB summary information about the nature and amount of any SFI related to human participants in research, along with the Committee's findings, FCOI determination and any FCOI Management Plan approved by the Committee. Investigators conducting Research involving human participants should note that review of SFI and implementation of an FCOI Management Plan, if such a Plan is necessary, by the Committee or the COIO does not constitute approval of the Research proposed. The IRB has final authority on whether the proposed Research should be approved and shall not render its decision until after the Committee has reviewed the SFI and implemented any necessary FCOI Management Plan. The IRB shall consider the FCOI Management Plan, if any, in its final determination and also may include additional protections to the FCOI Management Plan if it deems they are necessary for the protection of human participants.\nThe Investigator shall document his\/her agreement to abide by the FCOI Management Plan before the FCOI Management Plan may be finalized. This documentation of agreement may be recorded within COINS. The Investigator may request changes to the provisions set forth in the FCOI Management Plan, if such changes are requested within five (5) days of the FCOI Management Plan being sent electronically to the Investigator by COINS. The COIO or Committee shall consider the changes requested and make a determination whether to accept any of them.\nFunding for the related Research shall not be released unless and until the FCOI Management Plan has been implemented and agreed to by the Investigator. If funding has already begun, the COIO or Committee may request the funding to be held pending the FCOI determination and the Investigator's agreement to the FCOI Management Plan, if any.\nD. Required Updates:\nAll SFI disclosures shall be updated at least annually and within thirty (30) days after any new SFI is discovered or acquired.\nE. Required FCOI Training:\nThe University shall identify appropriate training regarding this Policy that shall be completed by all Investigators at least once every four (4) years or immediately upon the occurrence of one of the circumstances listed below. The training shall inform each Investigator of this Policy, the Investigator's responsibilities regarding disclosure of his\/her SFI, and of the federal regulations pertaining to FCOI (e.g., 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.601 et seq.). Immediate training for Investigators shall be required under the following circumstances:\nWhen the University makes revisions to this Policy that impact an Investigator's responsibilities under this Policy;\nWhen an Investigator is new to the University; and\nWhen the University finds that an Investigator is not in compliance with this Policy or with his\/her FCOI Management Plan\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nA.

Among its many missions, the University seeks to foster interactions between the private sector and academia, as interdisciplinary and translational research is of ever-increasing importance in transforming newfound knowledge into useable technologies and scholarship that benefit the public. There is, however, the potential for financial conflicts of interest in such collaborations. In most cases those conflicts can be managed appropriately, rather than eliminated, thereby enabling those involved in University Research to engage in that Research objectively and with integrity and at the same time maintain acceptable financial relationships with outside Entities and individuals. Disclosure of financial interests to the University will protect both investigators and the University from potential criticism or even government sanctions in the event such relationships are subsequently called into question."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad03","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConducting Educational Programs Using the Name of the University | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesConducting Educational Programs Using the Name of the University \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD03\nConducting Educational Programs Using the Name of the University\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nPolicy\nApplication for Use of University Name or Facilities\nProgram Administration and Related Issues\nAdministrative Responsibility\nExceptions\nNon-Educational Programs\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nDEFINITIONS:\nA non-credit program is any activity with academic content approved to offer educational value measures (EVM), continuing educational units (CEU), or professional educational hours.\nPOLICY:\nNon-credit programs originating at or through any campus or Penn State location, or through a faculty or staff member, using the name of the University, at which external audiences are expected, and either 1) a program registration fee is charged or underwritten, or 2) educational value measures, or continuing education units (CEUs or other profession-specific credits) are offered, must be offered through Conferences & Institutes or the Chancellor designee.

The submitting research office (i.e., the associate dean for research, institute director, or designee) assumes responsibility for preparing the proposal budget and thus also responsibility for coordinating the contributions of other units toward the proposed effort. If matching funds or significant other University contributions are being considered, the steps outlined below should be followed, with the goal of confirming the arrangement among units at least two weeks prior to the submission of the proposal.\nAs soon as participating researchers are identified for the proposal, the submitting research office should verify directly with the relevant research deans and institute directors that they are aware of the planned proposal. If agreement is expected to be straightforward on the level of matching and the contributions of the different units, the research deans and institute directors may decide to coordinate via e-mail. If that is the case, verifying agreement among the research deans is the responsibility of the submitting research office.\nIf the division of contributions to the proposed effort is likely to be complex, or the units have significant uncertainty regarding the level of their contributions, the submitting research office should schedule a match coordination meeting (MCM) of the PI, proposal team members, and the relevant college research deans and institute directors or their representatives. The meeting must also include the Associate Vice President for Research, Associate Dean for Research and\/or Institute Director of the PI, and staff from the submitting research office. The MCM can be scheduled by the Office of Vice President for Research (OVPR) or the Strategic Interdisciplinary Research Office (SIRO) if requested by the submitting research office.\nPrior to the MCM, the PI should work with the Associate Dean for Research and\/or Institute Director and the submitting research office to develop and distribute a draft proposal budget. The draft budget should include details as to how funds from the sponsor are expected to be distributed among administrative units and how funds will be separately allocated to the categories of graduate assistantship support, equipment, and external subcontracts. When appropriate, the PI should provide a list of faculty in the various units (beyond those included in the proposal) who will also be beneficially impacted, e.g., users beyond those listed in a proposal of a major research instrument.\nAlso prior to the MCM, the PI should work with the submitting research office to develop and distribute a detailed description of requested matching funds support, a draft financial breakdown and schedule for each unit's contributions to those matching funds, and a summary of the level of match to be requested from external partners. This support may include requests for cash, support for staff, technical personnel, post-doctoral researchers and\/or graduate assistants, etc. The division of matching commitments among colleges should typically be guided by the proportion of faculty effort in the proposed work and when appropriate, by the proportion of faculty who will benefit if the proposal were to be funded, e.g., as users of a major shared research instrument. If the proposed research effort is expected to require significant expenses that are disallowed as direct charges to the sponsors' funds, e.g., the cost of building renovations, a draft division of responsibility for these expenses should also be distributed prior to the MCM.\nIf the submitting research office determines that the draft budget and the proposed contributions from the participating units are agreeable to all of the units involved, then the scheduled MCM should be cancelled and the arrangement should be documented before proposal submission.\nAt the MCM, the PI should present his\/her vision for the proposed effort, the proposed budget, the matching funds request, and the distribution of effort among faculty in different units. The other attendees will discuss and, if possible, agree on the level of support to be provided by various Penn State units and to be requested from central funds, or on a set of questions that need to be answered before the level of contributions from different units can be agreed upon.\nThe submitting research office is responsible for distributing a draft summary of the proposed contributions from the participating units after the MCM and coordinating further discussions. When all parties have agreed, that office is responsible for documenting confirmation from the relevant units and submitting a matching funds request to the OVPR for central matching funds.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research, or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nRAG51 - Central Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment\nRAG52 - Central Matching Funds Program for Assistantships \/ Traineeships\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new guideline (incorporating old RAG21) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nApril 27, 2011 - New Policy Guideline (RAG21).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"Multi-investigator research proposals often require matching funds for cost sharing as well as University support for expenses that are not allowed as direct charges. When researchers from multiple Penn State units are involved, each unit typically contributes, and a summary of unit contributions to matching funds is required before a decision can be reached regarding a contribution from central administration (see RAG51 and RAG52). The internal support provided to any proposal is determined by a range of factors, including the available resources of the participating units, the requirements of the research program, the expectations of the external sponsor, and the strategic priority of the proposed research for the University.These guidelines describe a standard process to coordinate the appropriate level of contributions from different units in a manner that is transparent to the participating units, that facilitates early preparation of proposal budgets, and that minimizes the administrative burden on the researchers and the research offices submitting the proposals.

These centers may operate as either general fund operations, or University Services\/Auxiliary Enterprises.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS:\nFunds derived from the charging of fees or rates must be accounted for as income(as opposed to credit to expense) and must be credited to the account to which the related expenses are charged.\nFees or rates may not be established solely for the purpose of generating discretionary departmental income, especially if the department is funded to provide the activity or service at no or reduced cost. Fees or rates should be established only for units established as income generating by nature, or in other situations considered appropriate by the Financial Officer.\nPolicy FN14 prohibits services to an outside audience (non-University related or commercial), unless the service is commercially unavailable within the region of a campus and has the prior written approval of the Corporate Controller. In such a case the unit must provide clear rationale why the University should be providing this service to the commercial sector. In general, services being provided which are also provided commercially must be fully-costed, including the application of fringe and overhead. Auxiliary Enterprise units are exempt from this prohibition for purposes of this policy. Units operating as University Services or through general funds can obtain permission through the fee and rate submission process by identifying rates to be charged to non-University-related or commercial enterprises. In those cases, comparable market data for rates charged by others may be required.\nCertain cost-recovery fees, such as for centralized copy or fax services for a campus or department or charges to external not-for-profit groups for direct costs of providing security, do not require approval under this policy if the same rate fee is charged consistently to all units and the unit recovering the costs is not a full-cost recovery operation. The recovery of these charges fees should be accounted for as credit to expense rather than income.\nIn cases where these cost-recovery fees will be applied to contracts or grants, prior approval of the rate is NOT required provided that the cost is charged based on actual costs incurred. However, the following must be considered:\nCosts that would normally be considered an indirect cost, such as copying, printing, telephone, courier services, and mailing costs \u2013 would not be permitted to be charged as direct costs on a sponsored award unless the award is considered a major program or a cost justification form has been approved. See Cost Accounting FAQs for more detail.\nFor recharge centers that are recovering full costs, these costs can be billed at the actual cost rate, but it must be noted in all rate submissions that these costs will be billed based on actual costs as invoiced from vendor.\nThe department\/unit will be responsible for retaining and providing invoices, etc and user logs to substantiate the rates applied to contracts or grants upon request from authorized University personnel or external auditors.\nAPPROVAL OF FEES AND RATES:\nThere are two types of fees\/rates that require approval:\nFees for University services, activities, facilities or events. Fees are often not cost-based and may not necessarily have any associated costs, such as library fines. Fees may also be based on market pricing. Fees which are not developed on a full cost basis are not approved for use with governmental entities, especially as charges to federally sponsored grants and contracts.\nRecharge rates, which must be approved for all University-related services that charge federal grants and contracts. These rates must be approved to assure that the cost basis used to develop the fee rate is appropriate and that the federal government will be not overcharged for the services provided. If income exceeds expenses in any one year, the fee must be adjusted the following year to allow the federal government to recover the excess (i.e. cost basis must be lowered).\nBoth new fees\/rates and revisions to established fees\/rates must be approved by the Corporate Controller\u0092s Office, except as noted below.\nLimited Delegation of Approval Authority:\nFinancial Officers have the authority to approve fees and rates in the following situations:\nAdmission fees for cultural and entertainment events (such as theatrical productions) if the fee will be $50 or less (excludes SGA and ASA events).\nFees for student field trips based strictly on recovery of direct costs, such as reimbursement for transportation costs or admission fees.\nPass-through fees, for items such as insurance or supplies, where the costs are passed directly to the customer based on the exact price paid to the supplier.\nRecharge center rates changes of 10% or less in rates (on average based on the requested rate) can be approved by the Financial Officer; however, if the rate analysis is complex or complicated, such as a change in methodology used to calculate the rate, the Financial Officer has the discretion to refer the fee approval to Cost Analysis.\nCopies of fee or rate approvals granted by the Financial Officers must be sent to the Corporate Controller's Office (or Controller's Office for the College of Medicine).\nContracts for artistic or other events that set the admission fee as a condition of the contract do not require a separate submission of a request for fee approval. Approval of the contract by the Controller's Office will also be approval of the fees established in the contract.\nApproval Process:\nThe unit requesting approval must complete the form Submission of Proposal for New or Existing Fees, and prepare all supporting documentation as listed. If the fee or rate may be charged to federal or federal flow-through sponsored awards or directly to governmental entities as external customers, then the form must indicate that the fee or rate will apply to the federal government, and a full-costing model will need to be used to develop the fee or rate.\nRecharge rates and rates charged to sponsored programs will require more detail than fees, especially in providing detail as to the cost basis used to calculate the fee. Those submitting rates must provide adequate documentation to meet the audit standards of the federal government. The Financial Officer and Cost Analysis may request more detail to document or justify a cost change or element based on auditor expectations, requirements or guidelines.\nAll fees and rates must be submitted in an Excel spreadsheet, which will be returned to the unit that submitted the fees or rates as an official read-only copy and as a modifiable working copy.\nThe request for fee\/rate approval must be approved by the Budget Executive and the Financial Officer. Upon review and approval, unless the Financial Officer has limited authority to approve as previously noted, the Financial Officer will forward the request for fee\/rate approval to the Corporate Controller\u0092s Office for approval as follows:\nAll recharge rates which include direct and indirect costs being charged to federal grants and contracts, must be initially reviewed and approved by Cost Analysis, with final approval by the Corporate Controller's Office. College of Medicine rates should be sent to the Associate Controller for the College of Medicine. Revisions to current rates may be approved by the Financial Officer if under 10% (on average), otherwise these must also be submitted to Cost Analysis. These rates will remain in effect until new rates are approved; however certain specialized service rates (see note below) require biennial approval, even if the rates do not change. The Cost Analysis office can provide assistance in developing such rates.\nSpecialized Service Centers are specially designated recharge centers. These are defined by federal policy, 2 CFR part 220, ''Cost Principles for Educational Institutions (OMB Circular A\u201321) Appendix A, Section J.47 and based on these definitions, the University has designated certain recharge centers as Specialized Service Centers, including all Animal Facilities and the Materials Characterization Lab.\n\nRates can remain the same year after year. However, all recharge centers must perform an ANNUAL review to determine if the rates in place are resulting in under or over recovery of costs.\nIf upon conducting the annual review, a recharge center determines that the current rates resulted in over recovery of costs, then the rates need to be adjusted to reflect not only current costing structure but also adjustments to resolve the over recovery. The center would follow the process described above to submit new rates.\nIf a recharge center determines that the current rates are under recovering \u2013 which means that the rates are being subsidized \u2013 the center can either adjust rates to more fully recover cost (and submit for approval as detailed above), or can maintain the same rates. However, any funds used to provide the subsidy must be identified to Cost Analysis so these funds can be eliminated from the cost pools used to calculate the F&A rate.\n\nThe unit is responsible for reviewing rates, and if no fee adjustments are requried, providing a statement certifying to the Financial Officer that the rates in place are appropriate with a copy provided to Cost Analysis. The unit is responsible for maintaining records of the annual review.\nAll other fees (not recharge rates) must be reviewed and approved by Cost Analysis, with final approval by the Corporate Controller's Office (except for the College of Medicine which is reviewed and approved by the Associate Controller of the College of Medicine). These fees will be approved for an indefinite time but must be resubmitted if the fees change (increase or decrease) or if the costs underlying the fee structure change substantially.\nUnits should plan in advance for obtaining fee\/rate approvals.\nWhile specific timelines cannot be set based on workload changes throughout the year, units should allow for more time for approval of new or complex fees or rates.\nUnits may request that fees or rates be established for use both at University Park and campus locations, including providing a range of fees (fee will range from $5 to $10). If the fee or rate is approved for all locations, a campus does not need to separately request approval for the fee. However, if a campus determines that it wishes to charge a fee or rate different than the one approved, it must be submitted for approval.\nWhen fees\/rates are approved by the Corporate Controller\u0092s Office, the Financial Officer will receive the approval notice and should maintain files for all currently approved fees and rates, as well as a history file for previous fees. The history file must be retained for seven years. Units submitting rates must retain records to support the approved rates and the costs used to develop those rates. Cost Analysis will maintain a record of all officially approved rates.\nCOLLECTION OF FEES AND RATES:\nAll fees and rates approved through this policy must be consistently applied to all entities receiving the goods or service. The unit may not waive, reduce or increase established and approved fees or rates for any reason, unless a list of approved waivers and those authorized to exercise these waivers are included as part of the fee\/rate approval request. The Corporate Controller's Office may also grant waivers or exceptions to charging established fees or rates on a case-by-case(non-continuing) basis, with adequate documentation of the situation requiring the adjustment or waiver.\nIncome collected through the fees or rates must be properly reported and accounted for in the authorized University account. The income must be credited to the same account to which the expenses of the operation are charged. Fees or rates collected for services provided through a general fund operation must be accounted for in a general fund account. Financial Officers should be consulted on how to properly account for income generated by fees or rates. In some cases, it may be appropriate for fees or rates to be managed as credit to expense; but these need to be approved through the Financial Officer. Refer to the following Policies for information regarding the reporting and accounting of fees:\nFN01 - Processing Cash Revenues\nFNG03 - Cash Revenue Transactions\nIf the Financial Officer discovers that a unit is collecting income or crediting expense based on an unapproved fee or rate, the Financial Officer must consult with theCorporate Controller\u0092s Office. Actions may include loss of all income collected through the unapproved fee or a requirement to refund all such income to the parties from whom it was collected.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nMost Recent Changes:\nMarch 8, 2016 - Editorial change- correction of the last bullet in the PURPOSE section (reference to RAG18 changed to RAG05 in conjunction with changes to the Research Administration section).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 12, 2013 - Editorial change- addition of policy steward information, in the event that there are questions or requests for changes to the policy.\nAugust 2, 2011 - Major changes made throughout the entire policy to reflect current operations with respect to the scope, general provisions and approvals of fees and rates charged for the use \/ patronage of certain University facilities and services.\nJanuary 29, 2008 - Editorial changes made to \"Approval Process\" and \"Collection of Fees\" sectons; Assistant Controller references changed to 'Corporate Controller's Office.'\nApril 1, 2004 - Complete rewrite of policy.\nJuly 8, 1994 - Added \"Other non-student related fees and charges\" to scope of policy.\nJuly 18, 1986 - Added \"space rates charged for placing advertisements in University publication\" to list of sample charges covered by policy.

The Office of Vice-Dean for Research is responsible for coordinating DURC reviews and approvals at the COM.\nAPPLICABILITY:\nThis policy is applicable to all life sciences research, testing or teaching activities with DURC potential conducted under the auspices of the University and applies to all University campus locations, including the COM.\nDEFINITIONS:\nDual Use Research of Concern (DURC): Life sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, materiel, or national security.\nInstitutional Review Entity (IRE): The IRE is an oversight committee established by the University to review life sciences research using one or more of the fifteen select agents and toxins listed above for dual use potential, as well as work with researchers to assess the risks and benefits of the DURC and to develop risk mitigation plans when appropriate. The IRE provides ongoing oversight for any life sciences research identified as DURC and on-going compliance with any risk mitigation measures put into place. The IRE shall review risk mitigation plans annually and modify the plans as necessary.\nInstitutional Contact for Dual Use Research of Concern (ICDURC): An individual designated by the University to serve as an institutional point of contact for questions regarding compliance with the implementation of the requirements for the oversight of DURC as well as the liaison between the institution and relevant federal funding agencies. The ICDURC also provides required reports to the relevant federal funding agencies. At University Park and all other campus locations except COM, the ICDURC is the Director, Institutional Biosafety Program, in the Office for Research Protections. The ICDURC at the COM is the Biological Safety Officer.\nLife sciences: Pertain to living organisms (e.g., microbes, human beings, animals, and plants) and their products, including all disciplines and methodologies of biology such as aerobiology, agricultural science, plant science, animal science, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, synthetic biology, environmental science, public health, modeling, engineering of living systems, and all applications of the biological sciences. The term is meant to encompass the diverse approaches for understanding life at the level of ecosystems, organisms, organs, tissues, cells, and molecules.\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): An individual who is designated by the University to manage a research program and who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of that research.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nThe PI must notify (see \u201cSubmission Procedure\u201d below) the IRE as soon as:His\/her research directly involves one or more of the fifteen agents and toxins listed above; or\nHe\/she anticipates that his\/her research with one or more of the fifteen agents and toxins listed will also produce, aim to produce, or can be reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the seven experimental effects listed above; or\nHe\/she concludes that his\/her research with one or more of the fifteen agents and toxins listed above that also produces, aims to produce, or can be reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the seven experimental effects listed above may meet the definition of DURC and should be considered or reconsidered by the IRE for its DURC potential.\n\nThe PI must also:Work with the IRE to assess the dual use risks and benefits of the DURC and develop risk mitigation measures, if appropriate;\nConduct DURC in accordance with the approved risk mitigation plan. This includes the responsibility to not conduct research that has been determined to be DURC until a risk mitigation plan has been approved (as outlined below);\nBe knowledgeable about and comply with all institutional and USG policies and requirements for oversight of DURC;\nContinue to assess his\/her research to determine if, at any time, the research becomes subject to this Policy;\nEnsure that all laboratory personnel conducting life sciences research with one or more of the above listed agents or toxins have received the University\u2019s identified education and training regarding DURC; and\nCommunicate DURC in a responsible manner throughout the research process and not only at the time of publication. All communication shall be in compliance with the risk mitigation plan.\n\nThe IRE will:Establish and implement internal policies and practices that ensure the identification and oversight of DURC; and\nInitiate the institutional review and oversight process when research is identified by a PI as utilizing one of the fifteen agents or toxins listed above. The institutional review and oversight process will include:\nVerification that one or more of the fifteen agents or toxins listed above is being utilized; and\nReview of the PI\u2019s assessment of whether the research produces, aims to produce, or is reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the seven experimental categories listed above; and\nA determination of whether or not the research meets the DURC definition, if the research involves one of the fifteen agents or toxins listed above and aims to produce, or is reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the seven experimental categories listed above.\nFor research determined to be DURC, the IRE will:\nAssess the potential benefits of the DURC;\nConsider the risks and benefits of the DURC; and\nDevelop a draft risk mitigation plan for conducting the DURC and for communicating its findings; and\nWork with the PI and the appropriate federal agency to develop a final risk mitigation plan. The risk mitigation plan will be reviewed by the IRE at least annually.\n\n\n\nThe University will:Ensure that internal policies establish a mechanism for the PI to immediately refer a project to the IRE as soon as research uses one or more of the fifteen agents and toxins listed above that also produces, aims to produce, or can be reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the seven experimental effects listed above;\nMaintain an IRE which is composed of at least five members, empowered by the University to make decisions about DURC, is sufficiently knowledgeable about biosafety and biosecurity issues, has a range of life sciences expertise, and has at least one member who is familiar with the University\u2019s procedures and policies;\nWithin 30 calendar days of the IRE\u2019s determination of whether or not the research meets the definition of DURC, provide notification to the applicable funding agency of any research that involves one or more of the fifteen agents and toxins and one or more of the seven experimental effects listed above. Said notification shall also include the IRE\u2019s determination of whether the research meets or does not meet the definition of DURC. Note: For non-federally funded research, all required notifications will be made to the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d);\nWithin 90 calendar days of the IRE\u2019s determination that the research meets the definition of DURC, provide a copy of the draft risk mitigation plan developed by the IRE and PI to the applicable funding agency for its review;\nWithin 30 calendar days of any change in status of a DURC project (including when the research is determined by the IRE to no longer meet the definition of DURC) or any proposed change to the risk mitigation plan, provide notification of the change to the applicable funding agency;\nProvide education and training on DURC for individuals conducting life sciences research involving one or more of the fifteen agents and toxins listed above. Records of education and training will be maintained by the ORP for the term of the research grant or contract plus three years after its completion;\nMaintain records of the IRE reviews and determinations and any risk mitigation plans for the term of the applicable research grant or contract plus three years after its completion (but no less than a total of eight years); and\nReport instances of noncompliance with the USG DURC Policy, as well as instances of noncompliance with any mitigation measures undertaken by the University in order to prevent reoccurrence of similar noncompliance, within 30 calendar days to the applicable funding agency.\n\nSUBMISSION PROCEDURE:\nSubmission forms for all University campuses and colleges, except for the COM, can be obtained from the ORP website. Completed forms should be returned to the ORP, as detailed on the DURC submission form. Copies of submissions received by ORP will be circulated to IRE members.\nSubmission forms for the COM can be obtained from the COM IBC website. Completed forms should be returned to the Biosafety Committee Office, Room C1630A, Mail Code H138. 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA. Copies of submissions will be circulated to IRE committee members.\nAppeals will be heard by the IRE; however, by federal policy, the IRE has final authority and DURC determinations cannot be overruled by any administrator at the University.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nIn addition, any activities associated with the agents and toxins identified in this policy must also comply with Federal Export Control Regulations. Consequently, the DURC review would also need to be supplemented with an export compliance review if the research involved any potential export controlled activities, such as foreign sponsorship, foreign collaborations and\/or international travel. More information about Penn State Export Compliance policies and procedures is available at export.psu.edu.\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections.\n REFERENCES:\nUnited States Government Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern\u00a0\nMarch 2012 DURC Policy\u00a0\nA Companion Guide to the US Government Policies for Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC)\u00a0\nDual Use Research of Concern, Public Health Emergency\u00a0\nCase Study\u00a0\nSelect Agent Regulations\u00a0\nPenn State University Policy RA40, Compliance with Federal Export Regulations for Sponsored Research Efforts, and Policy AD89, University Export Compliance Policy\nEffective Date: April 17, 2017\n\tDate Approved: April 13, 2017\n\tDate Published: April 17, 2017 (Editorial changes, June 27, 2017)\nMost recent changes:\nJune 27, 2017 - Editorial changes to the footnotes in the POLICY section (Agents and Toxins).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nApril 17, 2017 - New Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy outlines the mechanism used by The Pennsylvania State University to evaluate research that is potentially Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC). It establishes a system of oversight for DURC and the mitigation of risks where appropriate.

Such relationship affects the handling of certain personnel actions, including the placement of employees.\nPRACTICE TO BE FOLLOWED IN PLACING EMPLOYEES THAT ARE RELATED:\nNormally, placements shall not be made where one employee is in a position to supervise or to influence the related employee's rate of pay, or promotion of the employee, or the granting of tenure, or where the handling of confidential information could create awkward work situations. However, the University recognizes that there are, in some instances, circumstances such as specialized educational background and experience where employment by two members of the same family in a single work area is desirable even though a supervisory relationship results.\nIn such special situations, placement of relatives may be made in the same area even though one of the related employees is in a supervising capacity. This is provided, however, that satisfactory arrangements are outlined and approved in advance, either by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University or by the Senior Vice President for Health Affairs and Dean, the College of Medicine at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center (as appropriate), which restrict (1) any supervising family member from making decisions such as those described in the forgoing paragraph that will directly affect a relative, and (2) access to confidential information as necessary to avoid awkward work situations. Disqualification arrangements shall be made when such occasions arise.\nEMPLOYEES WHO BECOME RELATED THROUGH MARRIAGE:\nThe conditions outlined herein shall apply, also, if two faculty or staff members become related through marriage after they are employed.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the circumstances under which relatives may be employed."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy12","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeapons and Fireworks Regulations, Fireworks, and Paintball Devices | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesWeapons and Fireworks Regulations, Fireworks, and Paintball Devices \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY12\nWeapons and Fireworks Regulations, Fireworks, and Paintball Devices\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nPolicy\nDefinitions\nRegulations\nFurther Information\n\n\nPOLICY:\nThe possession, carrying, or use of any weapon, ammunition, or explosive by any person is prohibited on all University property except by authorized law enforcement officers and other persons specifically authorized by the University.

Evaluations are coordinated by the appropriate administrator at the location of the faculty member's academic assignment, with input from the department or division head of the disciplinary unit.\nRATIONALE:\nCritical review is a natural element of a productive academic career. A faculty member's work is reviewed regularly in many different ways. Teaching is evaluated by peers and students; proposals for funding are evaluated by individual reviewers or panels of specialists; papers and books submitted for publication are reviewed by authorities in the field; published books are reviewed by other scholars; a faculty member's contributions in teaching, research and scholarship, and service are carefully scrutinized when the individual is considered for hiring or promotion.\nPerformance reviews are not only necessary for the process of determining merit salary increases; they also provide occasions for self-evaluation and reassessment of the role a faculty member is playing, which may evolve significantly during the course of a career. Reviews offer an opportunity to acknowledge and recognize good work, point out areas for improvement, and, in a few cases, identify productive new uses of a faculty member's talents. They are a means of ensuring that the diverse talents of the entire faculty are productively applied to the many responsibilities of the University. In addition, performance reviews can help identify resource targets -- places where additional resources could re-energize a faculty member whose energy or morale has run low or could lift an already productive member to new levels of achievement.\nSCOPE OF REVIEW:\nAnnual Review\nAll faculty must be reviewed annually by the appropriate administrative officer. Each review should include the faculty member's written annual report and evidence of teaching effectiveness, and should involve thorough one-on-one discussions with the administrative officer of the faculty member's teaching, research, service, future plans, assignments, and salary.\nThe evaluations are made by using elements listed in AC21, Definitions of Academic Rank, and AC23, Promotion and Tenure Procedures and Regulations, and are conducted in accordance with procedures developed independently within eachCollege. Each faculty member's evaluation is related to his or her area of assignment and responsibility, with maximum weight given to the area of major emphasis in the individual's assignment. The disciplinary head or comparable administrative officer will provide written documentation to the faculty member of the results of the annual review that is separate from the salary notification.\nFive-year Extended Review\nTo promote further professional development, the annual reviews should be supplemented every five years by an in-depth evaluation of a tenured faculty member's accomplishments, future goals, and progress towards those goals. The five-year interval will begin with the year of the most recent promotion decision(exceptions to this schedule for individual faculty members require approval by the Dean). The extended review process may, if unit guidelines so permit, include peer review by Penn State faculty and must involve one-on-one discussion with a supervising administrator.\nAs the basis for the review process, the faculty member will submit a narrative statement, a curriculum vitae, and other documentation of performance not covered by the CV. Unit guidelines will specify documentation of performance appropriate to the particular responsibilities assigned to faculty members over five-year review periods.Teaching performance, for example, may be evaluated with SRTE ratings, peer teaching evaluations, and\/or a teaching portfolio. The narrative statement should outline the faculty member's goals for professional development and describe past accomplishments and future objectives specific to those goals. The narrative may also describe additional accomplishments not apparent in the CV. The narrative will not exceed three pages in length.These items - narrative statement, CV, performance documentation - and copies of the past annual review letters by the supervising administrator for the evaluation period comprise the evaluation materials.\nTo provide adequate preparation time, faculty members should be given notice at least two semesters in advance of the submission deadline. The department or disciplinary head, director of academic affairs, dean, or comparable administrative officer will be responsible for supervising the peer-review process. This individual will meet with each faculty member under review. Discussion during this meeting will focus on the peer review of evaluation materials, the faculty member's goals and accomplishments, and means by which the goals will be realized. Written documentation of the results of the extended review will be provided by the administrator to the faculty member by the end of the academic year in which the review takes place.\nGeneral guidelines for five-year extended reviews, consistent with this policy statement, must be established with the approval of the unit's faculty by each college or school--which may in turn ask for more precise guidelines from departments or other similar faculty units, while keeping the responsibility of oversight. Unit guidelines will establish at what level (department or college for example) peer evaluation if any will occur, the process for selection of peer committees if applicable, and who the evaluating administrator will be. The peers and administrator may be at the department, division, campus, school, or college level. Units may also set guidelines that involve more than one level (such as both ahead and dean) in the extended review process. The results of the review must be forwarded to the relevant academic dean or campus chancellor if he or she is not directly involved in the process.\nRESPONSES TO REVIEW:\nIn the event that improvements in performance are necessary, as evidenced by the annual and five-year extended reviews, the faculty member and his or her administrative officer should work on an appropriate response, the implementation of which should be monitored by the administrative officer. Finally, a clear link must be established between the annual performance review and faculty rewards.\nResponsibility for overseeing the implementation of AC40 rests with theExecutive Vice President and Provost.\n\u00a0\nUPDATES:\n1\/29\/08 - Minor revisions; Added Five-year Extended Review section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy provides the process for an evaluation of the performance of each member of the faculty at least once each year.

A full contract year is based on the weeks of service specified in an individual's Memorandum of Service.\n\n\nUntenured Position\nThey have served the University for a minimum of seven full contract years of full-time service and hold the rank of senior scientist, senior research associate, or research associate.\n\n\nRestricted Funds\n\nIf paid with funds provided by an agency other than the University (USDA, for example), the use of restricted funds for the sabbatical must be allowed by the granting agency.\n\n\nAcademic administrators: A person classified as an academic administrator and holding a standing appointment in one of the ranks listed above is eligible for a sabbatical leave under the same conditions as described above for faculty (academic).\nExempt staff: The following exempt staff who have served the University for a minimum of six calendar years of full-time service, and who have arranged to use the sabbatical leave for graduate training, are eligible:\nCooperative extension personnel with the titles senior extension agent, extension agent, associate extension agent, or assistant extension agent.\nExempt staff permanently assigned away from University Park whose positions require the attainment of advanced degrees in the judgment of the appropriate executive.\nExecutives and administrators: When unusual circumstances warrant, persons classified as executive or administrator who have served the University for a minimum of six calendar years of full-time service are eligible. Sabbatical leave applications from executives and administrators do not follow the channel of approval described below, but, instead, shall be reviewed by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University, and the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business\/Treasurer, who jointly make a recommendation to the President of the University.\nSABBATICAL LEAVE APPLICATION FORM:\nThe Application for Leave of Absence With Pay (Sabbatical) shall be submitted in the manner described below for different categories of sabbatical leave applicants.\nREVIEW PROCESS:\nThe application for sabbatical leave shall be submitted with the recommendation of the department or division head or school or unit director, as appropriate, to the appropriate dean who in all cases will be the dean with major budgetary responsibility for the faculty member. A college level sabbatical leave committee shall be appointed for each college by the dean in consultation with the approved faculty organization. The sabbatical leave committee will review the application, consult as deemed appropriate, and submit its recommendation to the dean. The dean shall consider the recommendations of the department or division head or the school or unit director and the college sabbatical leave committee. The dean is also expected to weigh the fiscal and academic load considerations of the application carefully, but every effort should be made to assure that no sabbatical leave is denied to a faculty member because of the cost of maintaining the instructional responsibilities of the absent faculty member. Sabbatical applications approved by the dean shall be forwarded with appropriate documentation to the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University, who adds appropriate recommendations and forwards the sabbatical leave applications to the President of the University for final review and action.\nIn the case where a faculty member in an interdisciplinary unit or defense-related unit would be eligible for sabbatical leave, the Vice President for Research functions as a dean in the process described above in reviewing sabbatical leave applications from faculty members associated with interdisciplinary and defense-related research programs; the institute or facility director shall function as a department head in the process.\nFor faculty members who are in residence in one college but tenured in another, the college of budgetary responsibility will make the sabbatical recommendation, which will include a supporting recommendation from the department or division head or the school or unit director of the faculty member's tenure locus. Sabbatical leave applications of all University College faculty must be accompanied by a recommendation from the campus chancellor to the Vice President for Commonwealth Campuses. Sabbatical leave applications of all University Libraries faculty must be accompanied by a recommendation from the campus chancellor to the Dean of the University Libraries.\nAcademic administrators: Depending on the location of the academic administrator, the process described above shall be followed except that there will normally be no review by a department head prior to the sabbatical application being considered by the college committee, the dean or the campus chancellor.\nExempt staff: Sabbatical leave applications from eligible exempt staff as described above shall be submitted to the individual's supervisor for recommendation. The sabbatical leave application, together with the supervisor's recommendation, shall be submitted to the appropriate executive officer for review and recommendation to the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. The Executive Vice President and Provost of the University will add appropriate recommendations and forward the sabbatical leave applications from exempt staff to the President of the University for final review and action.\nExecutive and administrators: Sabbatical leave applications from executives and administrators shall be reviewed by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University, and the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business\/Treasurer, who jointly make a recommendation to the President of the University.\nGENERAL QUESTIONS FOR SABBATICAL:\nAs a part of the Application for Leave of Absence With Pay (Sabbatical) form provided for application for sabbatical leave, certain questions pertinent to the review and evaluation of sabbatical leave applications are included. Please refer to the form instructions for further details.\nAPPROVAL OF SABBATICAL LEAVE:\nFinal approval for sabbatical leaves will be made by the President of the University.\nDEADLINE FOR APPLICATION:\nApplications for sabbatical leaves should be submitted to the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University by the weekday coincident with or immediately preceding November 1 of each year for action by the following January 1.\nLENGTH OF LEAVE:\nA sabbatical leave shall not be granted for a period in excess of the full contract year of the individual; the contract year may be 36 weeks, 48 weeks, or a number of weeks between those two limits, or twelve months, depending on the type of appointment. While individual faculty members, in some cases, may be able to coordinate leaves of absence funded by grants or contracts with a proposed sabbatical leave, such arrangements are separate from this policy.\nSALARY PAYMENT WHILE ON LEAVE:\nThree sabbatical leave options are available:\nSabbatical leave for the full contract year at 67% salary;\nSabbatical leave for one-half of the contract year at 100%\n\nSabbatical leave for a period other than a full contract year or one-half of a contract year is, typically, for one of the periods listed below. The rate of pay in such cases is proportional to the length of the sabbatical leave as follows:\nRate of Pay For Sabbatical By Percent\nSabbatical Leave as % of Contract Year\n% of Pay During Year of Sabbatical\n90%\n73%\n80\n80\n70\n87\n60\n93\n\nNOTE: For sabbatical leaves for periods other than those cited above, see Percentage of Salary Received While on Paid Sabbatical in GURU. See also ACG15 - covering outside compensation.\nMEMBERSHIP IN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS WHILE ON SABBATICAL:\nAn individual who is granted a sabbatical leave and who is a member of the University insurance program may maintain membership during the sabbatical leave. If the individual is a member of a retirement plan in effect at the University, the individual is required to contribute to that plan; the amount that is contributed is based on the full salary of the individual rather than the salary received from the University during the sabbatical leave if less than full salary.\nPlease note: Health care contributions are determined on your annual base salary as of October 1 of each year, going into effect on January 1 of each year. A reduction in salary will not create a reduction in the health care contribution at the time your salary is reduced; the health care contribution will remain the same for the entire current year. The following year\u2019s contribution will be based on your salary as of October 1 of the current and the new health care contribution will be effective January 1.\nELIGIBILITY FOR EDUCATIONAL PRIVILEGES:\nAn individual who is on sabbatical leave and who is eligible for educational privileges will retain those privileges during the period of the sabbatical leave. Dependents of employees who are eligible for grants-in-aid will retain the eligibility during the time that the employee is on sabbatical leave.\nRETURN TO ACTIVE SERVICE REQUIREMENT:\nIndividuals granted sabbatical leaves are required to return for a full contract year of service following the sabbatical leave. Any person who does not return, or does not remain for the full contract year following the sabbatical leave, will be required to refund the salary received from the University during the sabbatical leave. There will be no proration of the amount to be returned if the employee remains for any fraction less than the full contract year. In addition, any person who does not return for a full contract year of service following the sabbatical leave will not be eligible to receive credit in any retirement plan for the period of the sabbatical leave.\nAs stated in HR99 Background Check Process, the self-disclosure requirement to report arrests and\/or convictions within 72 hours of their occurrence is still in force during sabbatical leaves. In addition, individuals on approved leaves, such as sabbaticals, of six months or longer are required to complete a \u00a0Penn State Arrest and Conviction self-disclosure form before returning to work.\nREPORT OF WORK ACCOMPLISHED:\nAt the conclusion of the sabbatical leave, the recipient must submit a report of the work accomplished to the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University via the executives, administrators and academic administrators in the channel appropriate as described above. The report should indicate how the experience improved the recipient's capacity to serve the University. In general, the report is to be submitted within two months of the return from sabbatical leave.\nSUBSEQUENT SABBATICAL LEAVE:\nAn individual becomes eligible for a subsequent sabbatical leave under the terms and conditions specified above, provided that the minimum required contract years of full-time service has elapsed since beginning a previous sabbatical leave. (Time spent on sabbatical leave, or any unpaid leave, is not counted as a part of the required contract years of full-time service.)\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR99 \u2013 Background Check Process\nACG15 - Regulations Regarding Use of Support Funds and Receiving Outside Compensation During Sabbatical Leaves of Absence\nUPDATES:\nOctober, 2010 - Application for Leave of Absence With Pay (Sabbatical) updated.\nJanuary, 2015 - Application for Leave of Absence With Pay (Sabbatical) updated.\nJanuary, 2015 \u2013 Return to Active Service section updated to include self-disclosure and self-disclosure form requirements under HR99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide a leave of absence with pay for purposes of intensive study or research which has as its outcome increasing the quality of the individual's future contribution to the University.

Approval of completed forms must be in accordance with Policy FN18. For ALL forms, approval signatures must appear on the original copy of the applicable form being processed. No photocopying or electronic reproduction of signatures will be permitted under any circumstances on documents processed through a central office.\nNo form may be used that substitutes for an approved official University form without prior review and approval by the steward of the form\/central office, as facilitated by the Office of Systems and Procedures (designated representative of the Corporate Controller).\nMODIFICATIONS TO \"OFFICIAL\" UNIVERSITY FORMS:\nRequesting the Use of a Modified Version of an Official University Form\nIf an administrative area desires to use a modified form instead of the official University form, and authorization to do so has not already been granted for that form, permission must be solicited via written request to the form steward\/Central Office. Typically, a modified form will be a revised version of the official University form customized specifically for use by the requesting area. If the form steward\/Central Office concurs with the request, documentation supporting\/ explaining the request will then be submitted to the Office of Systems and Procedures for review on behalf of the Corporate Controller.\nThe following information provides a basis for the form steward\/Central Office and Systems and Procedures to determine the acceptance of, and subsequent administration relating to, modified versions of official University forms. Based on these criteria, use of any format other than those approved must be approved on a form by form basis by the appropriate form steward\/central office and Systems and Procedures before  that format will be accepted for central office processing.\nModifications to official University forms and subsequent use of a modified version are NOT acceptable for central office processing, and permission will not be granted, if one of the following is applicable:\nOfficial form is prenumbered\nOfficial form is multi-copy\nOfficial form is produced using colored paper\nOfficial form is produced using colored ink\nTo be accepted\/approved, modified versions of an official University form must have the same information, and the layout must be as close as possible to the official University form. After review and concurrence by the form steward\/applicable central office and Systems and Procedures, a modified version of an official University form will be authorized for use (authorization in writing by the applicable form steward\/central office).\nRequests to modify official University forms include the following formats:\nphotocopies of a blank official University form\nFAX transmissions of a completed official University form (informational\/file copies; not for central processing)\ncomputer-generated\ncommercially printed custom versions\nmemos\/letters that include the same information found on the official University form\nUse of an Approved Modified Version of an Official University Form\nOnce approved and in use, modified versions must comply with the same approval policies required for the official form (see Policy FN18). All approval signatures must coincide with the approval guidelines estblished via the Authorized Approval System. As required when processing official University forms, all signatures on modified versions must be \"live\"; NO photocopying or electronic duplication of signatures will be permitted under any circumstances on paper documents processed through a central office.\nMaintenance of a Modified Version of an Official University Form\nOnce approval has been granted for an area to use a modified form version, any future changes to key data fields\/control elements of the official University form must also be reflected in the modified form. Like the original request, changes to a modified version must also be reviewed by the applicable form steward\/central office and Systems and Procedures. Accomplishment of such changes (through regular monitoring of GURU News announcements), and initiation to make the resultant changes to an approved modified version, will be the responsibility of the administrative area that originally requested the modified version. A central office has the right to reject any original or modified form that is not current.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: February 3, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 3, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 3, 2016\nMost Recent Changes:\nFebruary 3, 2016 - Reviewed and updated to reflect current operations and best practices for the proper use of official University forms.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 27, 2013 - Editorial changes.

Such action may, however, be taken against individuals whose behavior is addressed by this policy according to the University\u2019s regular employee or student disciplinary policies and procedures.\nDEFINITIONS:\nBehavioral Threat Management Team (BTMT)- A standing committee of multi-disciplinary experienced representatives who will analyze potentially threatening situations, especially imminent threats to others or self, and take action to mitigate risk, if warranted.\nEmployee- Any full-time or part-time employee of the University.\nIntimidation- Engaging in actions intended to frighten, coerce or induce duress. These actions include, but are not limited to, stalking, unwanted pursuit, harrassment, etc.\nOthers-Any other individuals not affiliated with the University.\nPhysical Attack- Unwanted physical contact including, but not limited to, hitting, kicking, pushing, shoving, biting, fighting, throwing objects or use of a weapon against another person.\nStudent- All individuals taking courses at the University, either full-time or part-time, pursuing undergraduate, graduate, or professional studies, both degree and non-degree seeking, as well as individuals enrolled in non-credit courses and programs. In addition, for purposes for the Student Code of Conduct, Code jurisdiction also includes individuals who have accepted an offer of admission to the University, who withdraw after allegedly violating the Student Code of Conduct, who are on leave of absence from the University, or who are not officially registered and\/or enrolled for a particular term but have a continuing relationship with the University.\nThreat- A stated intention to inflict injury, damage, or hostile action on someone or something, whether the intention is expressly stated or implied, whether the person communicating the threat has the ability to carry out the threat, whether the threat is made on a present, future, or conditional basis, or whether the threat is made in person, through another person, in writing, over the phone, in the mail, electronically, or by any other means.\nUniversity Facility(ies)- As used in this policy, any building or structure or any improved or unimproved land, or any part of any such building, structure or land, that is owned, used or occupied by The Pennsylvania State University.\nVisitor- Any non-employee or non-student present on a University campus or at any University-controlled location for any purpose, professional or private.

This includes, but is not limited to, campus buildings and the surrounding perimeters, including the parking lots, field locations, student housing, and alternate work locations.\nPOLICY:\nSafety on all University campuses is everyone's responsibility. By recognizing and reporting behavior believed to be a potential concern, community members and visitors to the campus can help others get the assistance and services they might need.\nThis policy establishes the BTMT as a mechanism to assess campus violence, threats of violence, and threatening behaviors, and to respond to such violence, threats, and\/or risks as appropriate. The BTMT\u2019s mission is to provide a proactive, coordinated, and planned approach to the identification, assessment, management, and, where possible, reduction and\/or prevention of behaviors that are brought to the team's attention.\nThe BTMT has been established to:\nIdentify trends that negatively affect the campus community;\nFacilitate timely communication among different campus units and others about individual behavioral concerns;\nInvestigate or gather additional information about individuals of concern, including individuals outside of the University community;\nAssess the information so that the University can devise an appropriate response;\nRecommend interventions, threat management plans, active monitoring plans, and other case management strategies that connect individuals of concern with needed resources;\nRecommend plans for reintegrating a subject once initial actions are complete and the threat is eliminated;\nAssist with the education of the campus community to increase awareness of potential threats, by identifying the types of behavior or concerns that should be reported, and how they should be reported to team members.\nMembers of the Penn State community are encouraged to contact the BTMT if they have concerns about their own safety, or the safety of those around them.\nReporting:\nIn the event of an incident and\/or suspect behavior as described in the definitions above, individuals are encouraged to promptly report such behavior. Immediate concerns about campus safety must always be directed to the campus police or security office, by dialing 911.

The BTMT will make every effort to protect the confidentiality and safety of anyone who reports a concern.

Students may be required to provide the PSUID when requested to obtain access to services at the University.\u00a0\nNOTE: Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), the PSUID cannot be used to display a student's scores or grades publicly. This also precludes posting grades using only the last four digits of the PSUID.\n\nEmployees: All University employees are issued a PSUID.\nOther Entities: There are other constituents associated with the University who may be issued a PSUID, who require access to University services\/resources (e.g. Penn State access account).\nIf an assigned PSUID has been compromised and used fraudulently, a new PSUID number may be issued by the Identity and Access Management Office.\u00a0\nPenn State id+ Cardholders are expected to take reasonable steps for safeguarding the confidentiality of the PSUID number displayed on the front of the ID card.\u00a0 If an id+ card is replaced the PSUID number will remain the same upon reissuance of the ID card, but a new id+ number will be issued, as specified in University Policy AD24.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this Policy, please contact the Privacy Office at privacy@psu.edu.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially:\nAD11, University Policy on Confidentiality of Student Records\nAD24, Identification Cards for Students, Faculty\/Staff, Affiliates, and Retirees\nAD53, Privacy Policy\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nMay 30, 2018 -

That record must be generated by the individual initially accepting possession of the cash revenue on behalf of the University at the time the revenue is received. Suitable evidence of the transaction must reflect the date and amount of the transaction, the reason for the revenue, the form of payment (cash, check, coupon, etc.), the identity of the area, and the employee accepting the revenue on behalf of the University. This documentation must either be prenumbered or otherwise controlled so that information regarding a transaction cannot be easily misplaced or modified without possible detection.\nCash revenue received by mail for an unidentified purpose must be taken to the respective Financial Officer for determination of the proper recipient. Since, in such a case, the proper recipient is unknown and, therefore, no individual has accepted possession of the revenue on behalf of the University at that time, no record of the transaction can be made at that time. Once the correct recipient has been identified by the Financial Officer, it is the responsibility of that recipient to generate the necessary record.\nThe person (or organization) paying must receive an acknowledgment that the cash revenue was received by the University if:\npaid in cash -OR-\nthe revenue is in payment of goods or services provided by the University -OR-\nthe revenue is a gift -OR-\nthe person paying requests that an acknowledgment of payment be issued.\n\nSuitable acknowledgment must indicate:\nthe date and amount of the transaction,\nthe reason for the revenue,\nthe form of revenue (cash, check, etc.),\nthe identity of the area accepting the revenue on behalf of the University, and\n(for transactions made in person) the identity of the person accepting the revenue on behalf of the University.\n\nIt is not necessary to issue an acknowledgment for:\nunearned revenue (utility commissions, grant payments, etc.) unless other University policies or legal obligations require such,\nrevenue for areas where individual transactions average under $2 each and total no more than $250 per month,\nrevenue from coin-operated machines,\nrevenue received by mail in response to a billing by the University.\n\nIf payment is made in person, AND if the payment is in cash OR the person paying requests that an acknowledgment of payment be issued, then written acknowledgment must immediately be given to the person making the payment. If payment is received by mail then the acknowledgment can be issued at a later date.\nWhen payment is made by one party to the account of another, then both parties must receive an acknowledgment of the transaction.\nFor transactions where an item is purchased and that item could also serve as the acknowledgment (e.g. athletic or entertainment tickets, visitor\/daily parking permits, etc.), no acknowledgment is necessary providing the item indicates:\nthe value of the item,\nthe purpose of the item,\nthe identity of the area providing the item.\n\n(Roll tickets sold at the door to an event are acceptable for use in this case despite the lack of such information if the value of the ticket is $10 or less.)\nSee Financial Guideline No. 03 for further information regarding acknowledgment.\nSupporting documents and procedures must be used which minimize the risk of misappropriated or misplaced cash revenue, ensure the timely deposit of those revenues, and ensure the timely and accurate reporting of those deposits to University budget records. Revenues must be fully traceable from the point of transaction to their appearance in University budget records and depository accounts. It is the responsibility of the Financial Officer of each area to determine the adequacy of documentation and local procedures based upon the constraints of this policy.\nRefer to Financial Guideline No. 03 for additional general information. Refer to Policy FN03 and Financial Guideline No. 1 for specific information for processing gifts of cash and grants from non-governmental sources. Refer to FN02 for specific information regarding charge sales. Refer to FN07 for specific information regarding credit card sales.\nREPORTING CASH RECEIVED:\nAll cash received by any department or area of the University must be deposited as quickly as possible with a Bursar-designated depository bank (or with the Bursar for student account and Bursar Accounts Receivable payments), and reported in a timely manner. For deposits directly affecting a student account receivable, the entry to the student account via the Integrated Student Information System (ISIS - both credit and non-credit activity) is sufficient notification at University Park. For ISIS deposits at non-University Park locations, a copy of the bank-validated copy of the deposit slip must be forwarded to the Financial Reporting department within three business days after the end of the month. In all other deposit situations, a Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) must be prepared in accordance with the appropriate instructions. For additional details, see Procedure CR2005 - Depositing Cash Revenues.\nUnder no circumstance is cash revenue to be forwarded via interoffice mail. Adequate transfer of accountability must be recorded (name, date, and deposit amount) if the deposit is not made directly by the person preparing the Report of Cash Receipts and\/or the person making entry to the Integrated Student Information System. Refer to Procedure  CR2004 - Accountability for Transfer of Items of Value (Except Equipment) for the proper methods of transfer.\nAt University Park, cash revenue received in payment of previous charge sales (invoiced through the Bursar's Office) must be immediately forwarded to the Office of the Bursar so that the customer's account may be credited. No transaction records or acknowledgment are made, nor is a Report of Cash Receipts prepared by the initial recipient of the payment (the Bursar's Office shall be responsible for the reporting of the revenue). Refer to Policy FN02.\nAt non-University Park locations, cash revenue received in payment of previous charge sales (invoiced through the location's Finance\/Business Office) must be immediately forwarded to that Finance\/Business Office so that the customer's account may be credited. No transaction records or acknowledgment are made, nor is a Report of Cash Receipts prepared by the initial recipient of the payment (the Finance\/Business Office shall be responsible for the reporting of the revenue). Refer to Policy FN02.\nDEPOSITING CASH:\nAll cash revenue must be deposited daily when $500.00 or more has been collected, however, not less frequently than once a week regardless of the amount collected. Revenue must be deposited either (1) in person at a bank with which the University transacts business, or (2) utilizing the University\u2019s service administered by the Corporate Controller\u2019s Office. Revenue must be deposited at a bank before the end of the second business day that total revenues warrant a deposit. Weekly revenue should be deposited on Friday and not held over a weekend.\nAt University Park, departments may make deposits by (1) taking them to the Office of the Bursar, (2) taking them to a Bursar-designated bank, or (3) utilizing the Bank Deposit Bag Tracking System.\nBursar Deposits\n\t\tThe Bursar will not count bank deposits for departments, but may temporarily hold a deposit bag for delivery directly to the designated depository. Secure deposit bags may be purchased from General Stores for the proper depository. Deposit slips are available from the Bursar. Responsibility for and transfer of the bags is traced through signatures on an Accountability Transfer Form, or an established log. The validated deposit slip is returned to the depositing departments via U. S. mail.\nBank Deposits\n\t\tDeposits made in person to one of the Bursar-designated depositories will be made with a deposit slip provided by the respective area's Financial Officer. The deposit slip must identify the campus or department making the deposit. A bank-validated copy of the deposit slip notated with the IBIS document number of the corresponding \"ROCR\" (Report of Cash Receipts) on which the deposit was reported must be retained in the departmental files for the current fiscal year plus two years. Reference Procedure CR2005 - Depositing Cash Revenues .\nBank Deposit Bag Tracking System\n\t\tAuxiliary & Business Services (ABS), in conjunction with the Corporate Controller\u2019s Office, has established a daily courier service to transport cash deposits. This service utilizes a deposit bag tracking system. Approved depositors are provided with a supply of prenumbered, barcoded deposit bags. This procedure is to assure that the University\u2019s cash receipts are properly safeguarded and deposited in a timely manner. For details, refer to Procedure CR2007 - Bank Deposit Bag Tracking\nAt non-University Park locations, the deposit is made with the bank deposit slip to the regular University depository account for that location. The deposit slip must identify the campus or department making the deposit.\nFor deposits not requiring a Report of Cash Receipts due to ISIS reporting, a bank-validated copy of the deposit slip must be retained in the departmental files for the current fiscal year plus two years. A copy of the bank-validated copy of the deposit slip must be forwarded to the Financial Reporting department within three business days after the end of the month. The clerk number, cycle date of posting, and ISIS batch number (if applicable) must be noted on deposit slips. Reference Procedure  CR2005 - Depositing Cash Revenues.\nFor deposits requiring an \"ROCR\" (Report of Cash Receipts), a bank-validated copy of the deposit slip (notated with the IBIS document number of the corresponding Report of Cash Receipts on which the deposit was reported) must be retained in the departmental files for the current fiscal year plus two years. Reference Procedure  CR2005 - Depositing Cash Revenues.\nCHECKS RECEIVED:\nAll checks and money orders received in payment of goods or services must be made payable to THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY and not to the area selling the materials or services. All checks, money orders and travelers checks must be restrictively endorsed immediately upon receipt to further limit the negotiability of the items.\nAlso, it is the department's responsibility to collect amounts due the University whenever checks accepted by the department are returned by the bank. Therefore, it is required that the department to which the check will be credited identify itself on the back of the check as part of its endorsement. Reference Procedure CR2002 - Processing Returned Checks .\nCHECK ENDORSEMENT:\nThe check endorsement must include the following:\nThe verbiage \"DEPOSIT ONLY - THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY,\" (or \"Penn State University\").\nThe name of the designated depository bank,\nUniversity's General Ledger Code for the Bank,\nThe University's account number with the designated depository bank,\nThe department number and fund number of the department to which the check will be credited. This information is necessary for the processing of returned checks. If the payment will be credited to multiple budgets, select a single budget to which a returned check may be charged.\nThe USER ID of the employee making the deposit should also be included on the back of the check.\nAcceptable Samples\n0101 Deposit Only\n\t{Bank Name}\n\tPenn State University\n\t{List Account Number}\n\t06-033-62 1007 040\n0111 DEPOSIT ONLY\n\t{Bank Name}\n\tPENN STATE UNIVERSITY\n\t{List Account Number}\n\t_________ \u00a0____ \u00a0___\nEndorsement stamps must be obtained through your Financial Officer, and must  incorporate the 5 items listed above.\nReference Procedure CR2005 - Depositing Cash Revenues .\nDEPOSITING CHECKS DRAWN ON FOREIGN BANKS:\nChecks which are payable in foreign currency require special consideration and may not be deposited in the same manner as checks drawn on U.S. banks. Such checks must be converted from the foreign currency to U. S.dollars.\nAt University Park, it is the responsibility of the Bursar to have the check converted through the University's banking institutions.\nAt non-University Park locations, the Financial Officer assumes the responsibility for currency conversion.\nNote that conversion costs are expensive and if the foreign check is for less than $50 U.S. dollars, it may be better to return the check and request payment in U.S. funds. Please see Procedure CR2005 - Depositing Cash Revenues for full details.\nRESTRICTIONS:\nCash receipts are not to be withheld from deposits in order to create change or petty cash funds for sales operations. If such funds are needed, they are to be requested in accordance with University Policy FN04, and the instructions contained in GURU.\nCash receipts are not to be intermingled with petty cash funds, nor are they to be used for making purchases normally made from petty cash funds (see\u00a0Policy FN04). Also, cash receipts are not to be used for making personal cash advances to employees, or for cashing checks.\nSAFEGUARDING CASH:\nIt is the responsibility of each department or non-University Park location to make whatever provisions are necessary to properly safeguard the cash receipts of their area.\nAny amount of cash on hand that exceeds $1,000 must be maintained in an approved safe (fireproof, bolted to the floor or immovable). Amounts of $1,000 and under must be maintained in a file safe or reinforced file cabinet with a pad lock and bar that secures all drawers. Cash should not be retained in desk drawers or standard file cabinets since they are easily accessed with nominal forcing or readily available keys.\nCASH OVER OR CASH SHORT:\nFOR NON-ISIS DEPOSITS -\nCash over or cash short must be reported on a Report of Cash Receipts. In addition, if the overage or shortage exceeds $20.00, the ROCR must be approved by the budget executive or budget administrator. See the \"ROCR\" documentation.\nFOR ISIS DEPOSITS -\nCash over or short must be reconciled by preparing a JVDP, Journal Voucher - Departmental (Financial)  that debits 0752 (Over\/Short account) and credits the Bank for shortages -OR- debits the bank and credits 0752 for overages. If the overage or shortage exceeds $20.00, the JVDP must be approved by the budget executive or budget administrator.\nREPORTING WIRE, EFT AND ACH PAYMENTS:\nIt is the responsibility of the area that receives payments by wire, EFT or ACH to assure the payment is recorded to the General Ledger (debiting the appropriate depository bank and crediting the appropriate buget\/fund). Wire, EFT and ACH payments must be reported on a Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) or through the appropriate Integrated Student Information System (ISIS) reporting channels.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: September 28, 2015\n\tDate Approved: August 19, 2015\n\tDate Published: September 28, 2015\nMost recent changes:\nSeptember 28, 2015 - Major revisions have been made to the RECORDING TRANSACTIONS, REPORTING CASH RECEIVED, DEPOSITING CASH, CHECKS RECEIVED, CHECK ENDORSEMENT, SAFEGUARDING CASH and REPORTING WIRE, EFT AND ACH PAYMENTS sections, to reflect current operations.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 12, 2013 - Editorial change- addition of policy steward information, in the event that there are questions or requests for changes to the policy.\nOctober 14, 2011 - Policy expanded to include wires, EFTs and ACHs as University cash revenues that must be properly accounted for, safeguarded, deposited, and reported in a timely manner.

Although the University encourages supervisors to consider all other flexible scheduling options, including use of available paid time off, prior to approving an incumbent employee\u2019s request to work a reduced FTE schedule, supervisors may place an employee on a reduced FTE schedule if the incumbent employee voluntarily accepts a reduction in work schedule and salary.\nAll arrangements require appropriate work unit approvals and in all cases supervisors are responsible to ensure that University business needs are efficiently and effectively met. The University may increase a reduced FTE schedule at its sole discretion. Supervisors should provide employees with as much notice as possible when increasing an employee\u2019s FTE.\nAll full-time employees on reduced FTE schedules must maintain a minimum of 75% FTE annually to remain in full-time status with the University.\nSETTING SALARY RATES:\nThe salary of each full-time employee on a reduced FTE schedule is prorated based on the employee\u2019s FTE.\nFor example, if the 100% FTE salary is $30,000, then the annual 75% FTE salary would be: $30,000 x .75 = $22,500.\nPAYMENT FREQUENCY:\nEmployees on a reduced FTE schedule are paid monthly, during months in which they work. Employees who are not scheduled to work twelve months will not receive pay during the months in which they do not work.\nBENEFITS:\nEmployees on a reduced FTE schedule are eligible for all full-time benefits. Insurance rates are calculated on the same basis as all other full-time employees.\nEmployees who work a reduced schedule year round will have deductions for insurance benefits elected taken from each paycheck monthly. Employees who work fewer than twelve (12) months per year will have deductions for elected benefits taken from each paycheck during months in which they work and earn enough to cover deductions. Employees will be billed at the employee rate for elected benefits during months in which their pay is not enough to cover the deduction or during months in which they receive no pay.\nIf an employee chooses to discontinue medical coverage during months not worked, the employee and dependents must wait until the University's annual open enrollment to elect coverage to be effective the following benefit year. Employees hired prior to January 1, 2010 who elect not to participate in medical coverage during the months not worked, may adversely affect their ability to retire with health benefits as outlined in\u00a0HR54 Continuation of Group Insurance After Age 60, Age 65, and After Retirement or Death.\nRETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS:\nRetirement contributions are made during months paid, but are not made during months not paid, except that members of TIAA may make private contributions at any time.\nFor employees enrolled in the State Employee Retirement System (SERS), reduced annual FTE will be reported to SERS. Employees should contact the SERS office to find out how this impacts their retirement calculations.\nEDUCATIONAL PRIVILEGES:\nEmployees on a reduced FTE schedule are eligible for educational grant-in-aid for themselves and their dependents as provided by policies HR36 and HR37 during the entire year regardless of schedule. Employees on months off schedules are eligible for educational grant-in-aid for themselves and their dependents during periods of no pay related to their schedule. Educational privilege eligibility during other periods of leave without pay are handled in accordance with the appropriate leave policies and practices.\nVACATION AND SICK LEAVE:\nEmployees appointed to positions with reduced FTE schedule accrue vacation and sick leave on a monthly basis, however, monthly vacation and sick leave accruals and maximum balances outlined in HR34 Employment Conditions for Staff Employees will be prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE. Examples:\nEmployee working 40 hours per week, ten months per year, September 1 through June 30 (83.3% annual FTE), earns 83.3% of accrual rates for vacation and sick leave during each of the twelve months (July through June).\nEmployee working 40 hours per week, nine months per year, August 16 through May 15 (75% annual FTE), earns 75% of accrual rates for vacation and sick leave during each of the twelve months (July through June).\nEmployee working 30 hours per week, twelve months per year earns vacation and sick leave based on 75% annual FTE during each of the twelve months (July through June).\nThe maximum vacation accruals outlined in HR34 are prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE. Employees on a reduced FTE schedule who meet the eligibility requirements under HR34 for payoff for vacation accumulation at the time of separation will be paid out vacation accruals at the time of separation. Payments will not exceed the prorated maximum accrual amount.\nEmployees who are retirement eligible are entitled to a payout of their sick accruals in accordance with HR34. Such payouts are prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE.\nHOLIDAYS:\nEmployees on reduced FTE schedules receive benefits for holidays in accordance with HR34. Holiday time for employees on a reduced FTE schedule is prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE.\nIf a holiday falls at a time when the employee is not scheduled to work, then the employee will earn holiday compensatory time. Employees must request holiday compensatory time for holidays which occur during their months off upon their return to work.\nIf a holiday falls during a time when the employee is scheduled to work more hours than the prorated holiday benefit, then the employee will be required to charge accrued holiday compensatory time, personal holiday, or vacation time to supplement the holiday benefit. Holiday compensatory time should be scheduled in advance like vacation and used prior to vacation time.\nExample:\nAn employee working 40 hours per week September through May, and not working in June, July and August (75% annual FTE) receives 6 hours of holiday time for all of the University holidays. Therefore, this employee accrues 6 hours of holiday compensatory time for the July 4th holiday; would use 2 hours of holiday compensatory, personal holiday, or vacation time per holiday to augment the holiday benefit time on the Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and December\/January holidays; and the Memorial Day holiday.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR06 - Types of Appointments\nHR34\u00a0- Employment Conditions for Staff Employees\nHR36\u00a0- Educational Privileges for Faculty, Staff, and Retirees\nHR37\u00a0- Grant-in-Aid for Dependents of Faculty, Staff, and Retirees\nHR54\u00a0- Continuation of Group Insurance After Age 60, Age 65, and After Retirement or Death\nHR92\u00a0- Employment Conditions for Employees Classified as Administrator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline expectations for full-time staff employees on a reduced FTE schedule."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr34","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Conditions for Staff Employees | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesEmployment Conditions for Staff Employees \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR34\nEmployment Conditions for Staff Employees\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: October 1, 1992\u00a0\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: January 1, 2018\nContents:\nPurpose\nProbationary Period\nWork Schedules\nNonexempt Staff\nExempt Staff\n\nVacation\nVacation Payout\nSick Leave\nSickness and Accident Supplement\nAbsence for On-The-Job Injury\nHolidays\nOther Paid Time Off\nOvertime - Nonexempt Staff\nShift Premium - Nonexempt Staff\nUnauthorized Absence\nRe-Employment with the University\nCross References\n\n\nPROBATIONARY PERIOD:\nFull-time staff employees serve a one (1) year probationary period. The probationary period begins on the employee\u2019s hire date. During the probationary period, University policy HR78 Staff Employee Failure to Meet Acceptable Standards of Performance does not apply to the probationary employee and the probationary period employee is not eligible to use the staff grievance procedure.\nIf a probationary employee voluntarily accepts a different job within the University during the probationary period, the employee will serve a new one (1) year probationary period, which will begin on the effective date of the employee\u2019s transfer.\u00a0\u00a0\nWORK SCHEDULES:\nNonexempt Staff\nUnless otherwise notified, the standard work week for University employees is a seven day period beginning Sunday at 12:00 a.m. and ending at 11:59 p.m. on the following Saturday.\u00a0 The standard work week is 40 hours for a 100% FTE non-exempt position, and the 40 hours are to be scheduled within that period. This is not, however, a guarantee that this number of hours of work will be available each week for each employee.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe daily hours of work for an employee will be scheduled so that provision is made for meal periods on the employee's time (except at the employee's request to forgo an unpaid meal period, when such request can be accommodated, or for certain continuous 24-hour operations). Except at the employee's request, subject to the approval of the manager, each unpaid meal period will be no less than 30 minutes. A typical work schedule is no more than five (5) days per week.\u00a0 Employees will not be assigned to a regular weekly work schedule of seven days every week. If possible employees will be scheduled to allow for consecutive days off.\u00a0Flexible working hours and work schedules less than 100% FTE may be established, see HRG02 and HR105 respectively.\nAt least one calendar week notice will be given to any employee if their regular work schedule is to be changed by the employee's manager, unless the change is caused by an emergency. In the event an employee reports to work and there is no work available, the employee is paid for three hours on a straight time basis unless the employee has been informed in advance not to report for work.\nExempt Staff\nFor a 100% FTE position, forty\u00a0(40) hours a week is a minimum requirement. Flexible working hours and work schedules less than 100% FTE may be established, see HRG02 and HR105 respectively. Many assignments may require longer weekly work schedules than the established minimum.\nVACATION:\nVacation time off for full-time staff is typically requested by the employee and is subject to the approval of the manager. When approving vacation requests, managers will consider unit and University operational needs. Employees on fixed-term I appointments may be required to take vacation time off during the appointment so that all or part of accrued vacation is expended prior to the conclusion of the appointment. There may be other circumstances where employees may be required to take vacation time off. An employee earns vacation in any calendar month in which the employee is paid for at least eighty-eight hours (88) hours of the normally scheduled work time in the month. For exempt staff, deductions from salary for time off in excess of accrued vacation may be made only for full-day absences unless allowable under the law.\n\n\tEligible employees accrue vacation on the last day of each month. Once accrued, time is immediately available for use by the employee.\u00a0Monthly rates of accruals and maximum accruals allowed will be prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE, see HR105. The following accrual criteria apply:\nNonexempt Staff Vacation\nCriteria\nMonthly Rate of Accrual\nMaximum Accrual Allowed\nDuring the first 10 years of continuous employment in a standing or fixed-term I position\n12 hours\n192 hours\nFrom the beginning of the 11th year to and including the 25th continuous year\n16 hours\n240 hours\nFrom the beginning of the 26th continuous year and thereafter\n18 hours\n264 hours\n\u00a0\nExempt Staff Vacation\nCriteria\nMonthly Rate of Accrual\nMaximum Accrual Allowed\nDuring the first 25 years of continuous employment in a standing or fixed-term I position\n16 hours\n240 hours\nFrom the beginning of the 26th continuous year and thereafter\n18 hours\n264 hours\n\u00a0\nAn employee preparing for a major life event such as the birth or adoption of a child, finishing a degree, etc., may request approval to accrue a vacation balance in excess of the maximum accrual limit. To do so, the employee submits a written request to the supervisor and the work unit Human Resources office outlining the event, identifying the period of time involved, and the plan for using such time, which must include the end date of the arrangement. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis taking into account University business needs. In all cases, the approved accruals\u00a0in excess of the maximums stated above must be used within twelve (12) months following the date of the approval. If the employee terminates employment, then the vacation payout\u00a0described below will not include any\u00a0vacation accrual in excess of the applicable maximum.\u00a0\nIn the event that an unexpected work-related situation causes an employee to miss or delay using vacation accruals, a request for approval to accrue a vacation balance in excess of the maximum accrual limit may be allowed. To do so, the employee and manager submit a written request to the work unit Human Resources office outlining the work-related event, identifying the period of time involved, and the plan for using such time, which must include the end date of the arrangement. In all cases, the approved accruals\u00a0in excess of the maximums stated above must be used within twelve (12) months following the date of the approval. If the employee terminates employment, then the vacation payoff described below will not include any\u00a0 vacation accrual in excess of the applicable maximum.\u00a0\nVACATION PAYOUT:\nAn employee who terminates employment after completing at least one continuous year in a standing or fixed-term I appointment immediately preceding the date of termination, or an employee who satisfactorily completes a fixed-term I appointment of less than one year who separates from the University at the conclusion of the appointment, will receive the cash equivalent of unused accruals (not to exceed the maximum provided by policy).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nSome colleges or departments may require certain employees to take vacation time off during their appointment so that all or part of their accrued vacation is expended prior to the conclusion of the appointment. Employees will not receive a vacation payout for any unused time if such time was required to be expended.\u00a0\nThe cash equivalent of the unused vacation time is computed by using the Workday Percentage Factor Calculator. All vacation payout amounts are calculated using the employee\u2019s full-time salary or hourly rate.\nSICK LEAVE:\nAn employee on a 100% FTE appointment will accrue eight (8) hours of paid sick leave for each calendar month in which they are paid for at least eighty-eight hours (88) hours of the normally scheduled work time in the month.\u00a0Monthly rates of accruals will be prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE, see HR105.\nNOTE: Exempt staff who began exempt employment prior to October 1, 1992, continue on their former sick leave plan.\u00a0\nAccrued sick leave is intended to provide employees with salary continuation in the case of illness or injury. Employees may be required to submit documentation from their healthcare provider in the event of an illness or injury prior to approval for use of sick accruals.\u00a0Except as otherwise provided below, absence is chargeable as sick leave only when the employee is unable to perform their duties because of their own\u00a0illness or injury. Time off for appointments with a healthcare provider may be charged to sick leave accruals when it is not possible for the employee to schedule the appointment on the employee's own time. Requests for time off are to be made as far in advance as possible. Employees may be required to submit documentation from their healthcare provider detailing the date and time of the visit.\u00a0\nIf an employee is charging sick leave and the employee's vacation accrual reaches the maximum, the employee may\u00a0charge vacation accruals instead of sick leave, so that vacation accruals are not lost. If an employee expends all accrued sick leave, additional absence, at the option of the employee, will be charged to accrued vacation. If the employee expends all accrued vacation, or elects not to charge the absence to accrued vacation, the employee will be granted a leave of absence without pay in accordance with HR16 Leave of Absence Without Salary.\u00a0 The employee may be required to submit documentation from their healthcare provider to substantiate the need for such absence(s). For exempt staff, a salary deduction will be made for absence in excess of accrued sick leave or vacation, only if such absence is for a full day unless deduction for less than a full day is permissible under the law.\nAn employee may use up to 40 hours of their accrued sick leave per calendar year to care for a sick family member. Family member as used in this policy is defined as persons whom the employee considers as family. The care provided may include such activities as bed-side care, accompanying the family member to a medical appointment, and emotional support.\u00a0\nAn employee who meets the eligibility criteria to leave the University as a retiree is eligible to receive 1\/4 the cash value of the employee's unused sick leave; provided, however, such payment will not exceed an amount equal to (a) 100 hours of pay, or (b) 136 hours of pay if the employee's accrued sick leave balance is at least 3\/4 of all sick leave accrued.\u00a0 All sick leave payout amounts are calculated using the employee\u2019s full-time salary or hourly rate.\nSICKNESS AND ACCIDENT SUPPLEMENT:\nAn employee who has five (5) or more years of continuous service in a standing or fixed-term I position who is absent beyond 60 continuous calendar days for an illness or injury will be covered by the University's Sickness and Accident Supplement; provided, however, for absences not covered by FMLA, if the employee has used more than forty-eight (48) hours of accrued sick leave in the full twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the absence without doctor's certification for such absences charged in excess of 48 hours, the employee will not be eligible for the Sickness and Accident Supplement. The employee must submit to the University a written statement from the employee\u2019s healthcare provider prior to the beginning of the absence, subject to appropriate approval processes as determined by the University.\nIf approved, employee will receive 1\/3 of normally scheduled hours of pay for each work day missed while covered by the Sickness and Accident Supplement. In addition, the employee, at the employee's option, may charge the equivalent of 1\/3 of normally scheduled hours of accrued sick leave for each work day missed and therefore receive 2\/3 pay. If an employee has used all of his or her accrued sick leave, additional absence, at the option of the employee, may be charged as provided herein against accrued vacation.\nAn employee will not be eligible to continue under the Sickness and Accident Supplement for an absence that continues beyond 180 continuous calendar days from the date of the beginning of absence for the illness or injury. Any payments received from the Sickness and Accident Supplement will be reduced by payment from other sources such as Workers' Compensation, Social Security, or other non-individual disability coverages.\nABSENCE FOR ON-THE-JOB INJURY:\nIf an employee is absent from work as a result of an injury or illness compensable under the Workers' Compensation Act, Occupational Disease Act, or similar legislation, the following conditions apply:\nThe employee has the option to request a leave of absence without pay or to charge the absence to his\/her accrued sick leave (or, if sick leave has been expended, to accrued vacation, personal holiday, service days, or holiday compensatory time off). An employee electing to use such paid time off will be charged 1\/3 of normally scheduled hours a day for each work day of absence and will continue to receive full salary.\nIf all paid time off is exhausted, the employee will be granted a leave of absence without pay.\nLeave of absence without pay will not exceed 24 months.\nAny compensation checks the employee may receive while receiving full salary will be endorsed and returned to the University. The employee will retain any compensation checks received while on leave of absence without pay.\nThe employee's contribution for all group healthcare and insurance coverages in which enrolled will be paid by the University, if the employee is on leave of absence without pay following an on-the-job injury, provided the employee continues to receive Workers' Compensation insurance payments.\nThe employee must furnish to the University applicable healthcare provider statements related to the injury or illness, subject to appropriate approval processes as determined by the University.\nHOLIDAYS:\nEach holiday established by the University is intended to give an employee on a 100% FTE appointment the benefit of eight (8) hours of paid time off. Employees with schedules involving longer than eight (8) hour days do not receive additional holiday time and are required to use appropriate accruals to cover for time in excess of eight (8) hours on holidays if they would have been scheduled and are not required to work. Holiday time off benefits will be prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE, see HR105.\nThe following 12 days are established as holidays:\nNew Year's Day\nMemorial Day\nIndependence Day\nLabor Day\nThanksgiving Day\nDecember 25 and five additional days\nA Personal Holiday\nWhen December 25 comes on these days - The six holidays are:\nThe Six Holidays\nDay\nHoliday Days\nSunday\nDecember 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\nMonday\nDecember 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\nTuesday\nDecember 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31\nWednesday\nDecember 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30\nThursday\nDecember 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31\nFriday\nDecember 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31\nSaturday\nDecember 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29\nSome areas substitute service days in lieu of some of the holidays listed above. Employees working in these areas should consult the following information.\nA newly hired employee commencing employment in a standing or fixed-term I position during December will receive only the December 25th holiday and the New Year's Day holiday, but will not receive paid time off for the additional University holidays in December during that first December holiday period. If such employee is required to work on any of the additional University holidays occurring that December, the employee will receive his or her regular pay for such day, but will not be granted holiday compensatory time off for the number of hours worked on the day.\u00a0\nOne personal holiday is earned each calendar year on January 1. A new employee in the first year of employment earns a personal holiday for that year after completing two months of employment. Employees hired on or after November 1 will accrue one (1) personal holiday on January 1 of the following year. The personal holiday is scheduled in the same way in which vacation is scheduled.\u00a0If not used, the personal holiday will be carried over into the next calendar year but not thereafter. The personal holiday(s) will not be paid out at the time of separation from employment, unless the separation is due to layoff under policy HR97 Layoff Provisions for Staff Employees.\nA nonexempt staff employee required to work a regularly scheduled work day on an official University holiday will receive his or her regular pay for the holiday and will be granted holiday compensatory time off at the rate of double time for the number of hours worked on the holiday, up to the number of hours normally worked by the employee on that day. At the option of the employee, the employee may receive the cash equivalent of 1\/2 of compensatory time off earned on a holiday. Such payment will be calculated using the employee's regular rate of pay. The option to receive such payment must be made within one calendar week following the holiday or holiday period. Holiday compensatory time off not converted to the cash equivalent will be used for absences where vacation accumulation would be used. Holiday compensatory time will not be paid out to the employee at the time of separation from employment.\u00a0Time worked on a holiday in excess of the employee's normal daily hours will be paid at two times the employee's regular rate of pay. Holiday compensatory time off will not be earned for such additional hours worked. If a holiday should fall on a day not normally scheduled as a work day for an employee the employee will be granted eight (8) hours of holiday compensatory time (see HR105 for positions that are less than 100% FTE). Such equivalent time off will be granted whether or not the employee works on the holiday and will be used for absences where vacation accumulation would be used, and scheduled in the same manner as requests for vacation. If the employee is required to work on such day, the employee also will be paid at the rate of two times the employee's regular rate of pay for the hours worked, but will not be granted additional holiday compensatory time off for such hours worked.\nAn exempt staff employee required to work on a regularly scheduled work day on an official University holiday will receive his or her regular pay for the holiday and will be granted holiday compensatory time off at the rate of double time for the number of hours worked on the holiday. At the option of the employee, the employee may receive the cash equivalent at the employee's regular rate of pay for 1\/2 of the compensatory time off earned on a holiday, not to exceed a normal day's gross pay for the employee. The option to receive such payment must be made within one calendar week following the holiday or holiday period. Holiday compensatory time off not converted to the cash equivalent will be used for absences where vacation accumulation would be used, and scheduled in the same manner as requests for vacation. If a holiday should fall on a day not normally scheduled as a work day for an employee the employee will be granted eight hours of holiday compensatory time (see HR105 for positions that are less than 100% FTE). Such equivalent time off will be granted whether or not the employee works on the holiday, will be used for absences where vacation accumulation would be used, and scheduled in the same manner as requests for vacation.\u00a0If the employee is required to work on such day, the employee also will be granted additional holiday compensatory time off at the rate of double time for the number of hours worked on the holiday. At the option of the employee, the employee may receive the cash equivalent at the employee's regular rate of pay for 1\/2 of such additional holiday compensatory time off earned, not to exceed a normal day's gross pay for the employee. The option to receive such payment must be made within one calendar week following the holiday or holiday period. Such holiday compensatory time off not converted to the cash equivalent will be used for absences where vacation accumulation would be used, and scheduled in the same manner as requests for vacation.\u00a0\nHoliday compensatory time off will not be paid out to the employee at the time of separation from employment.\nIf a holiday occurs during the vacation or sick leave of an employee, it will not be charged as a day of vacation or sick leave.\nAn employee on an unpaid leave of absence is not paid for holidays that occur during the unpaid leave of absence.\nIf a holiday listed above (other than December 25) occurs on a Sunday, the University will observe it officially on the following Monday.\nThe final date of pay status for an employee who indicates an intent to resign at a time near the December\/New Year's holiday is determined in accordance with HRG14.\u00a0\nThe above holiday provisions apply to work performed in the employee\u2019s full-time position.\nOTHER PAID TIME OFF:\nPaid time off, other than sick leave, vacation, or holidays is outlined below. All paid time off is prorated based on the employee\u2019s annual FTE. (See HR105 Reduced FTE Schedules).\n\u00a0\nFriday Following Thanksgiving\nThe University is not open for normal business on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Employees who are normally scheduled to work on Fridays and who are not required to work will receive their regular pay for the day. Employees who are normally scheduled to work on Fridays and who are required to work will receive, in addition to their pay for the day, compensatory time off equivalent to the number of hours worked, subject to a maximum of eight (8) hours. Employees who are not normally scheduled to work on Fridays and are not required to work on the Friday following Thanksgiving will receive eight (8) hours of compensatory time. Compensatory time off will not be paid out to the employee at the time of separation from employment.\n\u00a0\nDeath in Family\u00a0\nAbsence from work because of death in an employee's family will be allowed with full pay on the following basis:\nFor an employee's partner, brother or sister (including half-brother or half-sister, step-brother or step-sister); or for an employee's or an employee's partner's: parent (including stepparent, guardian, or foster parent), child or stepchild (including the partner of the child or stepchild), grandchild, up to forty (40) hours of leave to be used consecutively, provided such amount of leave is required. A guardian as used in this section will mean a person who raised the employee and served in the place of the parent for a substantial portion of the employee's childhood.\nFor the employee's or employee's partner's grandparent, niece, nephew, aunt or uncle, and partners of aunts and uncles or, the employee's partner's brother, sister, and partners of same, or, the partner of employee's brother or sister, up to eight (8) consecutive hours between the date of death and the date of the funeral or memorial service.\n\u00a0\nDeath-in-Family Chart\nFamily Member\nEmployee's\nEmployee's Partner's\nPartner\nup to 40 hours\nX\nParent (including stepparent, guardian, or foster parent\nup to 40 hours\nup to 40 hours\nBrother or sister (including half-brother or half-sister)\nup to 40 hours\nup to 8 hours\nPartners of brother or sister\nup to 8 hours\nup to 8 hours\nChild or stepchild\nup to 40 hours\nup to 40 hours\nPartner of child or stepchild\nup to 40 hours\nup to 40 hours\nGrandchild\nup to 40 hours\nup to 40 hours\nGrandparent\nup to 8 hours\nup to 8 hours\nAunt or uncle\nup to 8 hours\nup to 8 hours\nPartners of aunts and uncles\nup to 8 hours\nup to 8 hours\nNephew or niece\nup to 8 hours\nup to 8 hours\nAn employee who would qualify for death-in-family paid time off for regular work hours missed under the provisions of this section who already is receiving paid time off chargeable either to vacation accumulation, holiday compensatory time, a personal holiday or sick leave accumulation, will have such time off as applicable charged instead to death-in-family paid time off, up to the limits allowed under the provisions of this section. Additional time off will be charged against the employee's vacation accumulation or as a payroll deduction, at the employee's option.\n\u00a0\nInvoluntary Jury Service\u00a0\nIf an employee is on jury duty, the University will pay their\u00a0full salary for time absent from work. If the approved time absent results in the employee missing more than half of their\u00a0regularly scheduled work shift, the employee will be excused from the remainder of the shift with no loss of salary. (See note below.)\n\u00a0\nVolunteer Fire Fighting\u00a0\nThe full pay of an employee will be paid during the time spent by the employee during his or her regular working hours in fighting fires or in answering other public alarms, provided that the employee is a member of the volunteer fire department that is engaged in the activity or, in the event of a forest fire, the employee is engaged in an organized forest fire fighting operation in the area in which the employee's campus or center is located. (See note below.)\n\u00a0\nAmbulance Driving\u00a0\nThe full pay of an employee will be paid during the time spent by the employee during his or her regular working hours in nonscheduled driving of an ambulance for a volunteer ambulance club or organization serving the community where the employee's campus or center is located. If an employee is a volunteer ambulance driver for a volunteer ambulance club or organization that does not primarily serve the community where the employee's campus or center is located, the full pay of the employee will be paid during the time spent by the employee during his or her regular working hours in driving an ambulance provided:\nThe driving is limited to unplanned emergencies, and\u00a0\nThe employee is not called from work to drive. (See note below.)\n\u00a0\nSubpoenaed Witness\nIf an employee is subpoenaed as a witness and is not a party to the legal action, the employee's full salary will be paid for the time spent by the employee during his or her working hours as a witness. (See note below.)\n\u00a0\nCivil Air Patrol Members\nA member of a Civil Air Patrol Group involved in an air search and rescue mission will be paid his or her full salary for the time spent by the employee during his or her regular working hours, provided there is an authorized mission and the Civil Air Patrol authorities have requested the employee to report for duty. (See note below.)\n\u00a0\nEmergency Rescue\u00a0\nThe full pay of an employee will be paid during the time spent by the employee during the employee's regular work hours when engaged in an organized emergency rescue, provided the employee is a member of a bona fide search and rescue organization and the rescue activity is in the area in which the employee's campus or center is located. (See note below.)\n\u00a0\nNOTE: Paid time off covered by the Involuntary Jury Service, Volunteer Fire Fighting, Ambulance Driving, Subpoenaed Witness, Civil Air Patrol, and Emergency Rescue Sections, includes\u00a0time spent in the activity described, plus travel time, time necessary for normal sleeping, etc., as determined by management.\u00a0\u00a0\nOVERTIME - NONEXEMPT STAFF :\nOvertime is all time worked by a staff member appointed to a nonexempt position for the University that is in excess of forty (40) hours in a work week. In any week in which a University holiday occurs on an employee's regularly scheduled work day, or an employee has used other approved paid time off, such holiday or paid time off will be considered as time worked.\nOvertime is permitted to be worked only after advance approval by the manager. Such approved overtime is paid for at the rate of time and one-half the hourly rate, or at the rate of two times the hourly rate if the overtime qualifies as holiday overtime.\u00a0\nSHIFT PREMIUM - NONEXEMPT STAFF:\nEmployees in nonexempt positions will\u00a0be paid a shift premium of $.60 per hour for work beginning between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 9:59 p.m., and $.65 per hour for shifts beginning between 10:00 p.m. and 4:59 a.m. for all continuous hours worked on the shift. The shift premium will\u00a0be added to the base rate before the calculation of an overtime rate.\nUNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE:\nEmployees must follow appropriate approval processes as determined by the University in order to be approved for the use of paid or unpaid time off. Absences from work which are not approved by either the employee\u2019s manager or, in the case of a leave of absence, by the Absence Management Team, will be considered unauthorized and will not be paid. Employees may be subject to discipline for unauthorized absences up to and including termination from employment.\n\tIf an employee is absent from work and has not notified his or her supervisor, the employee will be considered as having abandoned his or her job at the completion of the third consecutive work day of unauthorized absence, unless the manager judges the circumstances to have been emergency in nature, and it can be shown that it was impossible for the employee to have given proper notification to the employee's manager.\nRE-EMPLOYMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY:\nIf an employee terminates employment with the University and is rehired after break in\u00a0service, the following conditions apply:\nThe employee is a probationary employee, and will serve a new probationary period as outlined above.\nThe employee does not receive service credit for his or her period of prior employment for the purpose of increasing the vacation accumulation rate, the length of leave of absence, or other working conditions related to length of service unless provided by University policy.\nThe employee does not receive credit for any unused sick leave from a previous period of employment.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR16 - Leave of Absence Without Salary (Other Than For Extended Active Military Service)\nHR19 - Leave of absence for Active Military Service or Training\nHR50 - Use of Accumulated Vacation at Time of Resignation or Retirement, or Upon Completion of a Fixed-Term I Appointment\nHR74 - Staff Vacancies Announcing Procedure\nHR90 - Extra Compensation for Exempt Staff Employees\nHR105\u00a0- Reduced FTE Schedules\nHRG02 - Flexible Scheduling\nHRG11 - Family and Medical Leave\nHRG14 - Termination of Employment Near Dec-New Year Holidays\nREVISIONS:\nJanuary 1, 2018 - Policy rewritten to reflect University practice\u00a0and\u00a0 changes related to Workday.\nMay 1, 2011 - Layoff and Recall section deleted.\nDecember 2, 2010 - Overtime-Nonexempt Staff Section updated.\nNovember 5, 2010 - Added language to reflect the Competencies Classification System changes.\nJuly 1, 2010 - Probationary period extended to 12 months and death in family language clarified.\nOctober 10, 2003 - Major policy re-write.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nDecember 21, 2017>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nDecember 29, 2017>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nJanuary 1, 2018>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline terms and conditions of full-time staff appointments."},{"university":"psu","name":"fn21","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office Telecommunications Services | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesNon-Office Telecommunications Services \n\n\n\nFinancial Policies\n\nFN21\nNon-Office Telecommunications Services\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nOffice of the Corporate Controller>\nContents:\nPurpose\nPolicy\nBusiness Criteria for Cellular Service \nCellular Service for Business Purposes\nUniversity-owned Cellular Plans\/Devices \nAcquisition of Services \nNon-Business Use \nTermination of Service \n\n\nReimbursement for Business Use of a Personal Phone \nContract Changes or Cancellations \nData Security and Confidentiality \nInternet Services \nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nPOLICY:\nThe University recognizes the importance and prevalence of cellular services for both personal and business communications and sets the following policy regarding cellular services.\nThe cost of a cellular voice\/data plan\/device is considered a personal expense for an employee and will not be directly paid for by the University unless certain business criteria are met. Budget executives and individual departments\/units have the authority to set higher business requirements to provide cellular services and related devices than those outlined by this policy. This includes emergency text messaging subscriptions offered by Penn State as well as other services or apps that may be used for business purposes.\nA unit has the authority to decide that it will not provide any cellular services or devices. Use of a personal cellular plan and device for business purposes will not be reimbursed unless it can be clearly documented that the employee incurred additional costs over and above the base plan for the employee.\nAn administrative area or unit must follow the policy outlined below to determine if it is appropriate to provide cellular services for an employee. The guiding principle for eligibility is that the use of a cellular plan\/device by an employee is for the benefit of the University, rather than the convenience of the employee and that the employee cannot perform their work duties unless cellular services are provided.\nInformation Technology Services (ITS) is responsible for establishing University contracts for cellular services with various providers. These contracts generally provide for discounts for both University and employee-owned cellular services and equipment. ITS will not be involved in contracting for individual service contracts, even for University-owned cellular plans. When obtaining services or equipment, employees need to assure that Penn State negotiated pricing is being applied. Cellular providers will require verification of employment (i.e. Penn State ID) to have contracted discounts applied to services and equipment.\nNOTE: Per policy FN14  - Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services,  any service paid or reimbursed by the University may not be used for any activities for personal gain (such as in the conduct of a personal business).\nBUSINESS CRITERIA FOR CELLULAR SERVICE:\nTo be eligible for cellular service provided by the University, one or more of the following criteria must be met:\nKey Personnel\nThe employee is considered key personnel for emergency or safety purposes.\nEmployee supports or is responsible for programs, services or systems that necessitate frequent and immediate communications throughout the day, after-hours or while away from the office on travel.\nTechnical Monitoring\nThe employee is required to be available 24\/7 to monitor essential systems, which may include receiving text messages from such systems upon outages or conditions outside of operating standards.\nThe employee must be available immediately for service calls or trouble-shooting during the work day.\nNo other communication source \nEmployee does not have access to other communication devices while on the job either because the employee has no assigned office and\/or primary work location changes based on assignments.\nThe employee is required to travel on a frequent basis and must maintain regular communication while in travel status.\nThe employee performs the majority of his\/her job duties \"in the field\", where business either cannot be conducted by a landline telephone or it would be inefficient to use a landline telephone.\nMost University employees will not be eligible for University-provided device and cellular service. There must be a strong and continuing business need before a department can approve issuing a University-provided cellular device and service.\nCELLULAR SERVICE FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES:\nUniversity-owned Cellular Plans\/Devices\nA University-owned Cellular Plan\/Device may be used where an employee or department has a need for University-owned cellular plans\/devices, especially for situations where the devices are shared among employees.\nAcquisition of Service:\nDocumentation of the business need for an employee\/department to obtain a University-owned cellular plan\/device is required through completion of the Cellular Usage Agreement (CUA) for University-owned cellular plans and devices. Different forms are required depending on how the service\/device will be assigned:\nIf the device will be pooled for general departmental use (signed out as needed), the department should complete the CUA for a Pooled Device , including documenting how the device will be tracked while in use and the business need for this service.\nIf an employee will be provided a dedicated device, the employee should complete the appropriate CUA for a Dedicated Device with full documentation of the business need for this service.\nThe completed CUA form must be approved by the budget administrator, the budget executive and the Financial Officer. No plans or equipment should be contracted or purchased until the appropriate CUA form is fully approved.\nThe department must contract for service directly with the chosen cellular provider based on obtaining the most cost-effective plan based on expected business use. The choice of cellular device to purchase must be based on balancing the required business needs versus the most cost-effective device available.\nThe Purchasing Card would be the preferred method for purchasing cellular plans and devices as well as for monthly charges. A copy of the CUA form must be attached to the Purchasing Card Support Form for the purchase of the service\/device and the monthly statements would be provided each month to settle the monthly service cost.\n Non-Business Use:\nUniversity-owned cellular plans and devices must be used primarily for business purposes. Any additional charges resulting from personal use must be reimbursed by the employee.\nTermination of Service:\nIf an employee is terminated, resigns, transfers or no longer has a need for a University-provided cellular plan\/device, the employee is required to promptly return equipment to the department through which the cellular device was issued and the department will either reassign the service\/device or end the service contract.\nREIMBURSEMENT FOR BUSINESS USE OF A PERSONAL PHONE:\nAs with all personal costs, reimbursement can be provided for business use of a personal cellular phone for business purposes, as is done for use of a home landline for business, when additional charges are incurred. For costs incurred while traveling, the travel policy would apply. Otherwise, the following reimbursement policy would be applicable:\nNo reimbursement would be provided for business use of a cellular phone (including text messaging) which falls under the normal calling plan for the employee.\nCellular plans would only be reimbursed if business use results in additional costs to the employee over the base plan. Reimbursement would be based on the percentage of business versus personal calls resulting in the overage. The assumption would be that all personal calls would be accounted for within the base plan first, and then business calls.\nData plans would only be reimbursed if overages resulting in additional costs to the employee occurred because of business use.\nReimbursements would be accumulated until the total amount payable is $10.00 or more, given the high cost of processing reimbursements.\nThe employee would be required to submit his or her monthly bill, indicating all business calls, text messages and data usage and documenting that business use resulted in an overage. Reimbursement would be based on the number of minutes used for business which resulted in the overage, assuming that all personal minutes are first to be covered. For data plans, the employee would need to demonstrate that the business usage resulted in additional cost to the employee.\nIllustrations of Business Use of Personal Phone Reimbursement Calculation\nAn employee makes 20 minutes of business calls on a personal phone, and incurs no overage charges. No reimbursement would be made.\nAn employee used 25 minutes on their cellular plan for business, and incurred an additional cost of $25 for a 50 minute overage, the University would reimburse 50% of the overage (25 minutes of 50 minute overage) or $12.50.\nAn employee makes 60 minutes of business calls on a personal phone from a total of 200 minutes used, with a base plan of $45 per month, but incurs no overage. No reimbursement would be made.\nEmployee makes 105 minutes of business calls on a personal phone from a total of 600 minutes used, with a base plan of $45 per month. The employees plan permits 550 \"free\" minutes per month. The 600 minutes used results in additional cost of $25 for a 50 minute overage above the 550 monthly minutes permitted under the plan. The employee would be reimbursed the $25 cost for the 50 business minute.\n\nCONTRACT CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS:\nFor university-owned cellular plans and devices, the University will bear the cost for any associated fees related to modifying or terminating the contract, with the exception of such costs arising from employee misconduct or misuse of the plan.\nDATA SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY:\nAll institutional data must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and must be protected with the same granularity of security control provided by the originating host system. This includes institutional data on mobile devices, including personal devices which may be used for business purposes. Certain private data, such as social security numbers, may not be retained on local or mobile devices unless an exception has been granted by the University Privacy Officer.

Degrees from qualified institutions (per above) are the only ones that the University will acknowledge for appointment, determination of rank, or subsequent personnel decisions. Further, misrepresentation of such information by an individual can be cause for denial or termination of employment.\nACADEMIC RANK:\nA. Ranks for tenure-line faculty\nAssistant Professor -\u00a0The assistant professor should possess a terminal degree or its equivalent in organized research or professional practice; must have demonstrated ability as a teacher or research worker; and must have shown definite evidence of growth in scholarly, artistic, or professional achievement.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssociate Professor -\u00a0The associate professor should possess the same qualifications as the assistant professor, but must also provide evidence of an established reputation in scholarly, artistic, or professional achievement.\n\t\t\u00a0\nProfessor -\u00a0The professor should possess the same qualifications as the associate professor, but must also provide evidence of a substantial record of advanced research and\/or creative work, and of leadership in his\/her field of specialization. This rank should be reserved for persons of proven stature in teaching and\/or research.\nB. Ranks for non-tenure-line (fixed-term or standing) teaching faculty\nLecturer or Instructor -\u00a0A lecturer or instructor should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent, or be an active candidate for a terminal degree, in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssistant Teaching Professor -\u00a0The assistant teaching professor should possess a terminal degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization; alternatively, the assistant teaching professor without a terminal degree should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization; must have demonstrated ability as a teacher and adviser; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and\/or mastery of subject matter.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssociate Teaching Professor -\u00a0The associate teaching professor should possess a terminal degree in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization; must have demonstrated ability as a teacher and adviser; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and\/or mastery of subject matter. Alternatively, the associate teaching professor without a terminal degree should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization; must have demonstrated exceptional ability as a teacher and adviser while in the rank of senior lecturer or instructor; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and\/or mastery of subject matter at a level of distinction beyond that of the assistant teaching professor.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nTeaching Professor -\u00a0The teaching professor should possess a terminal degree in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization; must have demonstrated exceptional ability as a teacher and adviser while in the rank of associate teaching professor; and must have shown evidence of professional growth, scholarship, and\/or mastery of subject matter at a level of distinction beyond that of the associate teaching professor.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nC. Ranks for non-tenure-line (fixed-term or standing) research faculty\nResearcher -\u00a0The researcher should possess a master's degree or its equivalent, or be an active candidate for a terminal degree, in an academic field related to his\/her research.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssistant Research Professor -\u00a0The assistant research professor should possess a terminal degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his\/her research. Alternatively, the assistant research professor without a terminal degree should possess at least a master's degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his\/her teaching specialization; must have demonstrated ability as a researcher; and must have shown evidence of professional growth and scholarship in his\/her discipline.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssociate Research Professor -\u00a0An associate research professor should possess a terminal degree or its equivalent in an academic field related to his\/her research; must have demonstrated ability as a researcher; and must have shown evidence of professional growth and scholarship in his\/her discipline.

Ranks for clinical faculty without terminal degrees\nUnits that designate faculty as \u201cclinical\u201d should establish, for faculty without terminal degrees, qualifications for each rank that track closely to the qualifications for research and teaching faculty without terminal degrees.\nClinical Lecturer\nAssistant Clinical Professor\nAssociate Clinical Professor\nF. Ranks for faculty in the University Libraries\nRanks for Faculty in the University Libraries are defined in internal University Libraries policies UL-HRG07 Promotion and Tenure Criteria (for tenure-line ranks) and UL-HRG16 Promotion of Full Time, Non-Tenure Track Faculty (for fixed-term ranks).\nPROFESSOR OF PRACTICE:\nThe professor of practice title is limited to those individuals who are non-tenure track faculty who may not have had the traditional academic background that is typical of faculty as they move through the professorial ranks. The title of professor of practice should be reserved for persons who have accumulated a decade or more of high level and leadership experience in the private or public sectors outside the academy that would provide a unique background and wealth of knowledge that is of particular value as it is shared with the University's students and other faculty. Prior to an offer being extended to an individual being considered for the professor of practice title, the appropriate dean or academic administrator shall consult with, and receive approval from, the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs.\nFIXED-TERM RANKS and PROMOTION PROCEDURES:\nFixed-term ranks and titles should follow the guidelines set forth above for teaching, research, and clinical faculty, as well as librarians. Units should have clear rationales for the different ranks and titles they choose to use and their expectations for faculty to achieve these various ranks.\nRather than use the titles \"lecturer\" and \"instructor\" interchangeably for fixed-term appointments, each college should determine for itself which of the two titles it chooses to use, and then use that title consistently for such appointments.\nColleges should have their own guidelines for distinguishing between lecturer\/instructor, assistant\/associate\/full professor positions for designating a third rank beyond that of lecturer or for promoting from one rank to the other, but all units should operate under the following University assumptions:\nAlthough there can be exceptions, positions above the first rank are designed to be promotion opportunities, with a recommended period of at least five years in rank as an instructor or lecturer (or, for fixed-term and standing faculty without tenure who hold terminal degrees, assistant teaching\/research\/clinical professors) before consideration for promotion. Fixed-Term and Standing non-tenure-line faculty should become eligible for promotion to the second rank after five years in rank, and would be permitted to compile their promotion dossiers in their fifth year. There should be no fixed time period for promotion to the third rank. Reviews for promotions should be conducted solely with regard to the merit of the candidate.\n\t\t\u00a0\nReviews for promotion of the full-time fixed-term and standing non-tenure-line faculty shall be conducted by Non-Tenure-Line Promotion Review Committees. Non-Tenure-Line Promotion Review Committees shall be constituted as follows: each of the colleges at University Park shall establish a committee for that college; each of the five stand-alone campuses (Abington, Altoona, Behrend, Berks, Harrisburg) shall establish a committee for that campus; each of the Special Mission Campuses (Great Valley, College of Medicine, and Dickinson Law) shall establish a committee for that campus; and the University College shall establish one committee composed of full-time fixed-term and standing non-tenure-line faculty from the campuses within the University College, with no more than one member from any campus. If a unit shall have fewer than seven full-time fixed-term and standing non-tenure-line faculty members, at least two members of that unit's Non-Tenure-Line Promotion Review Committee shall be drawn from another unit's Non-Tenure-Line Promotion Review Committee. Only full-time fixed-term and standing non-tenure-line faculty members in each unit are eligible to serve on and to vote for the members of the review committee in their unit. Only faculty of higher rank than the candidate should make recommendations about promotions. If there should be insufficient numbers of higher-ranked fixed-term and standing non-tenure-line faculty, exceptions to this provision may be permitted by the Executive Vice President and Provost at the request of the academic unit.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe promotion procedure itself should include recommendations by both a campus\/department faculty committee, (b) the DAA or department\/division head, and (c) the approval of the campus chancellor and\/or dean of the college.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAll promotions should be accompanied by a promotion raise, in addition to a merit raise, to be determined and funded by the college.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFaculty members who are promoted\u00a0shall be considered for a multi-year contract. If a multi-year contract is not granted, then factors that shaped this decision shall be communicated to the fixed-term faculty member at the time when a new contract\u00a0is offered.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe exceptions to this policy are the College of Medicine, the Colleges of Law (Dickinson and University Park), and the University Libraries, since their faculty have for many years been hired off the tenure-track and do not create confusion about their relation to tenure-track faculty.\n\t\u00a0CROSS REFERENCES:\nAC23, Promotion and Tenure Procedures and Regulations\nMost recent changes:\nMay 30, 2018 - Editorial updates to section Fixed-Term Ranks and Promotion Procedures.\nJune 13, 2018 - Editorial updates to\u00a0guide administrative actions related to the provision of multi-year contracts.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJuly 1, 2017 - Editorial updates to titles for fixed-term and standing non-tenure-line faculty.\nApril 20, 2007 - Editorial change to add title of Professor of Practice.\nNovember 2, 2006 - Editorial update to change Intercollege Research Programs to Interdisciplinary Programs.\nJune 6, 1958 - New Policy.\nJune 27, 2018 - Removal of Professorial Titles for Research Faculty due to the\u00a0retirement of AC-24 \"Professional Dual Titles for Research Rank Faculty.\"\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nMay 30, 2018>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nMay 30, 2018>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nMay 30, 2018>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy provides guidance on the qualifications necessary for appointment or promotion to the various academic ranks."},{"university":"psu","name":"hrg14","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing Date of Termination of Employment Occurring Near December\/New Year's Holiday  | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesEstablishing Date of Termination of Employment Occurring Near December\/New Year's Holiday  \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Guidelines\n\nHRG14\nEstablishing Date of Termination of Employment Occurring Near December\/New Year's Holiday \nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nGUIDELINE'S INITIAL DATE: April 10, 1970\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: October 1, 1992\nContent:\nPurpose\nUnique Aspect of University's Holiday Calendar\nEstablishing Final Date of Employment\n\n\n\nUNIQUE ASPECT OF UNIVERSITY'S HOLIDAY CALENDAR:\nMost employers other than educational institutions have holiday schedules providing a somewhat even distribution of paid holidays throughout the calendar year. However, because of the University calendar, a large number of established University holidays occur in the December\/New Year's holiday period. It is not fiscally sound to grant an employee with relatively short University service a large number of paid holidays occurring at such a time, or to permit an employee regardless of the length of prior service to receive the New Year's Day holiday for a short period of work in the new year, when the employee does not intend to continue his or her employment relationship with the University following the holiday period.\nESTABLISHING FINAL DATE OF EMPLOYMENT:\nIf an employee indicates his or her intent to resign at a time near the December\/New Year's holiday period and the employee began regular continuous employment prior to the preceding January, or if hired in the preceding January, worked sufficient days that January to earn vacation for the month, the following conditions apply:\nIf the employee had continuous regular employment status through the calendar year, and\nIf the employee works his or her last regular scheduled work day prior to the December close down (or if absent that last day, the absence is due to a bonafide illness), and\nIf the employee is not required and does not work the balance of the month because of the University holidays or regularly scheduled days off, then\nThe employee's termination date shall show as the end of December, rather than the last day the employee was physically at work.\nIf the employee was hired subsequent to the preceding January, or if hired in the preceding January and did not work enough days that January to earn vacation for the month, the final date of active pay status shall be the last day the employee is actively at work.\nIn either case, the employee should not be permitted to extend service into the next calendar year for the purpose of granting those University holidays in December or January to the employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide a reasonable standard for establishing the final date of pay status for a regular employee who indicates an intent to resign at a time near the December\/New Year's holidays.(NOTE: This Human Resources Guideline may be used for general guidance for retirement, but also see HR50 and HR51\u00a0for further information.)"},{"university":"psu","name":"ac76","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Rights and Responsibilities | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesFaculty Rights and Responsibilities \n\n\n\nAcademic Policies\n\nAC76\nFaculty Rights and Responsibilities                (Formerly  HR76)\n\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice Provost for Faculty Affairs>\n\u00a0\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: September 1, 1973\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: May 31, 2011\nPurpose\nScope\nConciliation\nOmbudsperson\nCommittee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\n....

Obligations of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\n.... Consultation Between Review Bodies\n.... Notification of the Executive Vice President and Provost's Decision\n\n\n\nSCOPE:\nA. In these procedures the term \"faculty member\" refers to members of the University faculty as defined in the University Faculty Senate Constitution (Article II, Section 1) plus any other University employees in academic positions which lead to permanent tenure. (This definition is subject to the clarifications of the Guidelines for Implementation section of this policy.)\nB. The Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities established by the procedures may review petitions from faculty members and administrators involving:\nAny situation in which a faculty member asserts that he or she has suffered a substantial injustice resulting from a violation of: a) academic freedom; b) procedural fairness; or c) professional ethics. The Committee does not review cases of alleged discrimination or of sexual harassment as defined in AD41 (see section F below). However, claims that involve discrimination or harassment plus one of the three areas named above will be investigated simultaneously by the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities and by the Office of Affirmative Action. Each body will examine the part(s) of the claim within its respective area of competence, will share evidence where appropriate, and will inform the other of its findings. (See \"Consultation Between Review Bodies\" below).\n\t\t\u00a0\nAny situation in which an administrator seeks a Committee judgment as to appropriate action toward a faculty member who, in his or her judgment, may be failing to meet his or her responsibilities.\n\t\t\u00a0\nC. The Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities will normally consider only petitions which involve, as a direct party, faculty members as defined above. Exceptions to this restriction apply to University academic employees (a University academic employee is a person whose duties include instructional, research or creative responsibilities) as follows:\nNOTE: This definition of academic employee excludes graduate assistants.\nDismissal. Any University academic employee may make use of these procedures upon receipt of notice of dismissal. A dismissal is a termination before the end of the period of appointment.\n\t\t\u00a0\nNonreappointment. Any University academic employee who can demonstrate that considerations violative of academic freedom significantly contributed to a decision of non reappointment may make use of these procedures.\n\t\t\u00a0\nOther matters. The Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities may, as it deems appropriate, review petitions or appeals of any University academic employee in matters beyond the above limitation. In such cases, the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities will review the petition according to their usual procedures, but formal hearings will not be held except in rare cases where there are compelling reasons for them.\nD. Cases of substantive dispute involving the termination of tenured appointment for cause or for reasons of financial exigency or program elimination or revision, or the release of a faculty member during the provisional appointment period with less advance notice than that specified in University policy, shall be considered at a hearing by the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure under the \"Committee Procedural Rules\" described in the Policy AC70 Dismissal of Tenured or Tenure-Eligible Faculty Members.\nE. Cases involving questions of ethics related to research and other scholarly activities shall be referred to the Vice President for Research (See RA10).\nF. Cases involving a claim of discrimination or sexual harassment will be referred to the Office of Affirmative Action (See B1 above). Should a multipart petition be filed that claims discrimination or harassment and also one of the grievances for which the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities and\/or the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure is responsible, each reviewing body will conduct an independent investigation on those claim(s) within its area of competence. (See \"Consultation Between Review Bodies\" below.)\nCONCILIATION:\nColleges and campuses should have a person or group to serve in the role of ombudsperson. The objective is to enhance communication and clarify possible misunderstandings in situations which involve potential disputes, to advise faculty members and administrators as to appropriate courses of action, and to help settle matters before they become hardened into serious disputes.The individual or group should be selected by procedures approved by a majority of the faculty in the unit.\nOMBUDSPERSON:\nSelection and Responsibilities of Ombudspersons\nA. An Ombudsperson shall be appointed in each of the colleges, campuses and academic units.\nFor those not associated with an academic unit, or in cases where the appropriate ombudsperson may be in doubt, the following policy shall be applied:\nWhere appropriate, the ombudsperson will be from the same academic unit to which the employee is most closely associated. For example, research associates in the Applied Research Laboratory will have access to the ombudsperson for the College of Engineering.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where there is disagreement or doubt as to the appropriate ombudsperson, the Executive Vice President and Provost shall make the determination.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where the ombudsperson is in doubt as to his or her jurisdiction, he or she shall ask the Executive Vice President and Provost for a determination.\nB. The Dean, Chancellor, or other appropriate campus official and the faculty shall jointly develop selection procedures for the ombudsperson. Normally, the role of ombudsperson will be performed by a single person, with a designated alternate. In unusual circumstances, a group of not more than three persons may be selected. No one who is a member of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities shall serve as ombudsperson.\nC. Functions for the ombudsperson are:\nClarification of misunderstandings;\n\t\t\u00a0\nAdvising faculty and administrators as to appropriate courses of action;\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssisting in the informal resolution of differences;\n\t\t\u00a0\nAssuring that appropriate department, college and\/or campus procedures are exhausted before referring the case to higher levels;\n\t\t\u00a0\nInforming the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost and appropriate college or campus officials if a matter cannot be resolved at the lower level and the case is to be referred to the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe ombudsperson shall not:\nHold hearings;\nExceed the role of conciliator and advisor;\nSubstitute his or her judgment for that of appropriate administrative and\/or faculty bodies;\nServe as counsel for either party to a complaint before the Hearing Board.\n\nCOMMITTEE ON FACULTY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:\nEstablishment of the Committee\nThe Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities will have nine members elected by the Senate: six faculty members and three members of the Academic Leadership Council. Two of the faculty members shall be from academic voting units other than those at University Park. The Chair will be chosen by the committee from the elected faculty members and will serve a one-year term as chair.\nSix faculty members and three deans will be elected as alternates for three-year terms. Two of the faculty members shall be from academic voting units other than those at University Park.\nThe term of office for members and alternates will be three years commencing on July 1. The terms will be staggered to provide for continuity.\nThe Senate Committee on Committees and Rules will present a list of nominees to fill vacancies and expiring terms on the Committee at the next to last meeting of the Senate each academic year. Additional nominations may be made from the floor at that time.\nElection of Committee members and alternates will be by secret ballot. No member of this Committee may serve concurrently on the Standing Joint Committee on Tenure and\/or the University Promotion and Tenure Review Committee.\nOperation of the Committee\nThe Committee Chair will be elected by the Committee from among its elected faculty members. The term of office will be for one year -- from July 1 through June 30.\nA quorum of the Committee will be a majority of those remaining after disqualifications on a matter at issue, subject to a minimum of three members.A majority of those voting on a matter at issue will be faculty.\nUpon receiving a petition, the Committee will make a preliminary determination as to the extent of its review of the matter. The Committee will reserve the right not to take up a complaint that it judges unsubstantial or without merit or where it appears that other remedies should be sought before coming to the Committee. The Committee may decide to perform an Informal Review or to establish a Hearing Board. As a result of an Informal Review, the Committee may decide to reject a petition, to use its good offices in an attempt to bring about a satisfactory settlement, to bring recommendations to the Committee for a Full Committee Review and vote, and\/or to establish a Hearing Board. In a Full Committee Review, the Committee shall reach its conclusions and recommendations by a majority vote of those present and voting (subject to the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph).\nA Hearing Board will be established only when the issue is clearly serious, a prima facie case has been established by the complaining party, and the Committee finds that reasonable efforts have already been made to solve the problem, and that no alternative way of attempting to settle the matter is appropriate in the circumstances.\nThe burden of proof in establishing a prima facie case will be on the complaining party. The Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities should attempt to settle matters brought to it as quickly as possible without sacrificing fairness to all parties. Only in extraordinary circumstances should there be a time span longer than 90 days between the receipt of a complaint by the Committee and a decision as to whether there will be a formal hearing.\nThe Role of a Hearing Board\nFor a particular case, a Hearing Board, consisting of two faculty members and one Dean to be chosen from the Committee by methods of its own selection, will be established to hear the case. The Hearing Board will elect its chairman from among its members. A member will remove himself or herself from a case if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified by reason of bias or interest. Each party will have a maximum of two challenges without stated cause. If disqualifications and challenges make it impossible to set up a Board with 3 members from the Committee or elected alternates, the SenateCouncil will select substitutes for a particular case. Each party will have a maximum of two challenges of such substitutes without stated cause.\nIf a hearing is scheduled, notice will be served with a specific statement of the complaint at least 20 days prior to the hearing. The party complained against may waive a hearing or may respond to the complaint in writing at any time before the hearing.\nHearings before a Hearing Board will not be public. Publicity and public statements about the case by either the faculty member or administrative officers will be avoided until the proceedings have been completed. The Hearing Board may have present at the hearing such assistance as it deems necessary.\nDuring the proceedings the parties will be entitled to have an advisor and counsel of their own choice. The Hearing Board will not be bound by strict rules of legal evidence, and may admit any evidence of probative value in determining the issues involved. Every possible effort will be made to obtain the most reliable evidence available and to avoid excessively legalistic procedures.\nA verbatim record of the hearings will be taken and both parties will receive a copy of that record.\nThe Hearing Board will grant adjournments to enable either party to investigate evidence as to which a valid claim of surprise is made.\nThe parties will be afforded an opportunity to obtain necessary witnesses and documentary or other evidence. The University administration will make reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Hearing Board in securing witnesses and making available documentary and other evidence.\nParties will have the right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses.\nThe Hearing Board's findings of fact and conclusions will be based solely on the hearing record. The Hearing Board shall reach its conclusions by majority vote.\nDecision of the Executive Vice President and Provost\nConclusions and recommendations from the Committee or a Hearing Board shall be submitted to the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University through the Chair of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities. The Executive Vice President and Provost shall notify the Chair of the decision that has been reached.\nIn the event that the Executive Vice President and Provost's decision is not in accord with the conclusions of the Committee or the Hearing Board, the reasons for that decision shall be specified to the Chair of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities who will inform the Committee and the parties directly involved. (See also Notification of the Executive Vice President and Provost's Decision in the \"Guidelines for Implementation\" section of this policy.)\nAt the first regular Senate meeting of each academic year, the Chair of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities will present a brief general report of the Committee's activities.\nGUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION:\nThe Senate Report\nA report \"Procedures on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\" was adopted by the University Faculty Senate on May 8, 1973. These procedures became effective as University policy as of September 1, 1973. The Preamble of the Senate report is not included as part of this policy, but should be used for guidance on such matters as the meaning of academic freedom, professional ethics, and procedural fairness. University policy begins with Section II -Scope of the Senate report.\nDefinition of Faculty\nThe term faculty member shall include the Senate's definition of its electorate plus all research equivalent ranks as specified in the Policy Manual AC21. The definition is as follows: All persons who are not candidates for degrees at Penn State, who hold full-time academic appointments, and who fall into one of the following categories -- those holding professorial, research or librarian titles, those who are full-time instructors or assistant librarians, and those other full-time academic employees who are members of the Graduate Faculty, but who do not fall into either of the above categories.\nIssues for Review: Limitations\nSection B under Scope defines the kinds of issues which the Committee may review. The Committee shall not consider the substantive academic judgment aspects of such matters as promotion, tenure, compensation, and evaluation of performance. In such matters as these, only procedural fairness may be reviewed.\nSection C. 4. under Scope describes other matters that may come under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities.\nApplication of Policy to Other Professionals\nSome persons who are not included in the definition of faculty members should also have access to these procedures for those matters specified in Scope, Section C. This provision shall apply to professional employees involved in teaching, research or creative activities who are attached to a research unit or an academic college. This would also include the following categories: part-time (with at least a six-month appointment), visiting, clinical, and adjunct academic personnel.\nObligations of the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities\nThe preliminary determination referred to in the third paragraph of Operation of the Committee must include a Committee judgment that the appropriate department, college and\/or other unit administrative procedures have been exhausted prior to the point the Committee decides whether or not to review the petition further. In making such a judgment, the Committee shall consult with the ombudsperson in the appropriate college or campus.\nIn the event the Committee decides to informally review the case or hold a hearing, the petitioner, the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost, the appropriate college and\/or campus official, and the college or campus ombudsperson shall be notified immediately.\nConsultation Between Review Bodies\nShould a multipart petition be filed that contains claims for which both the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities, and\/or the Office of Affirmative Action is responsible, each reviewing body will conduct an independent investigation on the claim(s) within its area of competence. Each reviewing body will consult with the other(s) during the process, will share evidence where appropriate, and will inform the other(s) of its findings.\nNotification of the Executive Vice President and Provost's Decision\nAfter receiving the conclusions and recommendations on a case from a Hearing Board, the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University shall notify the parties directly involved, appropriate University administrative officers, and the Chair of the Faculty Rights and Responsibilities Committee as to his or her decision. The Chair shall be responsible for informing the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities.\n\n\t\u200bUPDATES:\n6\/10\/10 - Minor editorial adjustment to Operation of the Committee section.\n10\/20\/09 - The Senate Committee on Committees and Rules voted to change the term of ombudsman to ombudsperson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy defines the procedures to be followed when issues involving faculty rights and responsibilities have not been successfully resolved through the normal channels of administrative responsibility and procedure.Disputes are best addressed through direct discussions among the parties to the disputes.

However, an individual age seventeen (17) who has graduated from high school, or has attained his or her academic potential as determined by the appropriate chief school administrator, is treated as age eighteen (18) for the purpose of state legislation governing the employment of minors and, therefore, is not under the purview of this policy.\nMINIMUM AGE FOR EMPLOYMENT:\nEmployment at The Pennsylvania State University is available only to a person who has reached his or her sixteenth birthday. A person under sixteen years of age is not permitted to work for the University under any circumstances.\nEMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFERABLE WORK PERMIT:\nEach minor (as defined above) who is to be employed at the University either full-time or part-time is required to present either an employment certificate or a transferable work permit to the Employment and Compensation Division before beginning employment. These forms are sometimes referred to as \"Working Papers.\" State regulations vary somewhat for the two types of forms:\n1. Employment Certificate\nAn employment certificate is required each time a minor changes employers or goes into a different type of position with the same employer. If the type of work a minor performs changes in basic character, or the minor transfers to a different type of job (for example, from office worker to landscape laborer; or landscape laborer to laboratory helper), a new certificate must be obtained.\n2. Transferable Work Permit\nA transferable work permit is transferable from one employer to another and from one job to another with the same employer. Both employment certificates and transferable work permits are issued for specific periods and must be reissued if the minor is employed longer than originally anticipated or again at another time.\nPROCEDURE WHEN EMPLOYING A MINOR:\nWhen it has been decided to employ a minor in any position, full-time or part-time, the Employment and Compensation Division must be called. This division can review all of the necessary procedures that will have to be completed to secure an employment certificate or transferable work permit. The minor is not to do any work for the University until the supervisor receives notice from the Employment and Compensation Division that an employment certificate or transferable work permit has been received and approved by the University.\nEach employment certificate or transferable work permit is retained in the Employment and Compensation Division.\nWhen the employment of a minor is terminated for any reason, or the minor graduates from high school, inform the Employment and Compensation Division. It is necessary to return the employment certificate to the school district, or the transferable work permit to the minor.\nWORK SCHEDULE LIMITS:\nNo minor aged 16 or 17 shall be employed more than 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, or 44 hours a week. If such an employee works during a high school term while enrolled as a high school student, the limit is 28 hours per week.\nContinuous working hours may not exceed 5 hours without interruption of at least 30 minutes for lunch for a minor who is 16 or 17 years of age.\nDuring a high school term, no high school student aged 16 or 17 may be employed between the hours of 12 midnight and 6:00 a.m.. However, a minor who is 16 or 17 years of age may be employed until, but not after, 1:00 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and on days preceding a school vacation occurring during the school year, excepting the last day of such vacation period.\nPROOF OF AGE:\nIn any case where there is doubt about the age of an applicant for a position, the applicant should be required to submit a proof of age card. This card is issued by the school district in which the applicant is or was enrolled.\nREQUIRED POSTINGS:\nPennsylvania State law requires that an abstract of the Child Labor Law and a list of minors employed in an area be posted in a conspicuous place in the area. The list must include the names of the minors, their ages, their individual daily starting and stopping times (including the starting and stopping times for a meal or rest period of at least thirty minutes) and their individual total hours of work for the week.\nCopies of the abstract, and the form for listing minors' names and schedule information, are available from the Employment and Compensation Division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To comply with state legislation governing the employment of minors."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr55","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to Know When Leaving University Employment | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesThings to Know When Leaving University Employment \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR55\nThings to Know When Leaving University Employment\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: February, 1961\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: March 4, 1998\nContent\nPurpose\nGroup Life Insurance\nHealthcare Coverage\nDental and Vision Coverages \nVoluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan and Long Term Disability Plan Coverages\nRetirement Contributions\nFinal Pay Checks\nKeys and Equipment\n\n\nGROUP LIFE INSURANCE:\nProtection in this plan stops 31 days after the end of the pay period in which the resignation becomes effective. The employee's University policy can be converted to an individual policy without a medical examination if application is made within this 31 day period.\nA faculty or staff member should contact any agent of the Prudential Insurance Company if he or she wishes to take advantage of the conversion privilege.\nNOTE: An individual who desires to continue life insurance and is in good health may be able to obtain more desirable coverage by contacting a representative of any commercial insurance company. This is because converted policies are limited to one type. The amount which may be converted is limited to the amount in force immediately prior to termination.\nThe cost of the converted policy will be higher than the University's because: (1) the type of insurance to which one converts is whole life insurance instead of the less expensive group term insurance; and (2) the age of the individual at time application for conversion is made is also a factor.\nHEALTHCARE COVERAGE:\nAfter a faculty or staff member leaves the University, protection under a University healthcare plan stops at the end of the pay period during which the resignation is effective.\nCoverage may be continued for up to 18 months under the COBRA provisions, if application is made within 60 days from the date of termination of the coverage. Information about continuation may be obtained from the Employee Benefits Division.\nNOTE: An individual who desires to continue this coverage may be able to obtain more desirable and less expensive coverage by contacting a representative of an outside insurance company.\nDENTAL AND VISION COVERAGES:\nDental and vision coverages, if applicable, stop at the end of the pay period during which the resignation is effective. Dental and\/or vision coverage may be continued for up to 18 months under the COBRA provisions, if application is made within 60 days from the date of termination of the coverage.\nVOLUNTARY ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT PLAN AND LONG TERM DISABILITY PLAN COVERAGES:\nIf applicable, coverages under both of these plans stop at the end of the pay period during which the resignation is effective. Both of these plans can be converted to individual policies if application is made within 31 days after the end of the pay period. Conversion application forms can be obtained from the Employee Benefits Division.\nRETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS:\nA faculty or staff member who is leaving University employment should contact one of the following offices regarding possible retirement benefits or the withdrawal of contributions.\nState Employes' Retirement System - Contact the SERS Counseling Center, or call toll free 1- 800-633-5461.\n\t\t\u00a0\nTeachers Insurance and Annuity Association - Contact TIAA at 730 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017; call toll free 1-800-842-2010.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFederal Civil Service Retirement System - Contact the Agriculture Extension Office.\nIn certain instances, retirement credit is portable and may be transferred to the retirement system of the new employer. If the faculty or staff member who contributed to the State Employees' Retirement System (SERS)is accepting a job with an agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, contributions may not be withdrawn when leaving the University. Likewise, if the faculty or staff member has contributed to TIAA and is accepting a position with an institution which has TIAA retirement, contributions may not be withdrawn when leaving Penn State.\nIt generally takes from four to six weeks following the termination date for contributions to be refunded.\nFINAL PAY CHECKS:\nThe faculty or staff member must make arrangements to receive his or her final pay check (unless he or she has direct deposit) and year-end W-2 form. If a change of address is known, a new\u00a0W-4\u00a0(Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate) should be submitted. If there is a change of address after termination but before the end of the calendar year, the Payroll Office (Room 101 James M. Elliott Building) must be notified so year-end tax statements can be forwarded to the new address.\nIn order for the final pay to include any unused accumulated vacation pay, if applicable, University policy states that the Termination of Employment form must reach the Office of Human Resources by the fifteenth of the month of termination for employees paid monthly, and by the end of the pay period for those paid biweekly. Refer to PR09 for the method used to calculate the rate of pay for unused vacation, if applicable.\nIf payment for unused accumulated vacation is due but is not included in the final pay, a separate payment at the next pay date will be made. For faculty and staff who do not have direct deposit, unless other arrangements have been made, the final pay check and\/or the separate check for vacation accumulation will be held at the Office of the Bursar.\nKEYS AND EQUIPMENT:\nPrior to leaving, the faculty or staff member shall return all University-issued items including:\nKeys\nEquipment\nBooks\nSupplies\nID Card\/Security Badge\nParking Permit (except Emeritus retirees)\nCalling Card\nSecurID Token\nAmerican Express Corporate Card (except Emeritus retirees)\nDiners Club Corporate Card\nPurchasing Card\nCellular\/Car Phone\nPager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the things that a faculty or staff member should know about group life insurance, healthcare, retirement contributions and other matters if he or she leaves University employment prior to retirement."},{"university":"psu","name":"hrg02","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate Work Arrangements | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesAlternate Work Arrangements \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Guidelines\n\nHRG02\nAlternate Work Arrangements\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nGUIDELINE'S INITIAL DATE: July 13, 1990\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: July 27, 2006\nContent:\nPurpose\nFlexible Scheduling\nNonexempt Staff Employees\nRequired Approval\n\nTelecommuting\nFactors of Successful Telecommuting\nResponsibilities for Successful Telecommuting\nEstablishing a Telecommuting Program\nInsurance Coverage\nChild Care\nResources\n\nPerformance Evaluations\nLimitations\nCross References\n\n\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING:\nThe term \"flexible scheduling\" encompasses many variations from the standard work schedule. The more complicated the arrangements, the more record keeping and supervision of the program is required. In its simplest form, a flexible schedule involves allowing an employee to vary the span of the workday.\nFlexible scheduling can be as simple as changing the work hours from an 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. workday to a 7:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. workday, changing the lunch break from one hour to one-half hour, or working an extra hour on Monday in order to leave an hour earlier on Tuesday.\nFlexible scheduling can be more complicated, allowing an employee to establish her\/his own start\/end times and\/or lunch break, within predetermined guidelines.\nThe ultimate flexible schedule would designate part of the workday as core time, when the employee must be present unless specifically excused by the supervisor, with the balance of the day considered as flex time and variations during these periods left to the discretion of the employee. For example, a supervisor could establish a core time of 8:30 to noon and 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., with flexible hours from 7:30 - 8:30 a.m., noon to 2:00 p.m., and 4:30 - 5:30 p.m.\nEven if a supervisor has not instituted a formal flexible scheduling program, employee requests for temporary changes in the workday such as to take a class, or to go to a doctor's appointment without charging sick leave, may be granted by the supervisor, provided such requests are in accordance with the provisions of this guideline. (See also applicable policies regarding sick leave and HR36, Educational Privileges for Regular Employees and Other Members of the University Staff.)\nNonexempt Staff Employees\nWhen considering a request for a change in working hours for a nonexempt staff employee, a supervisor must abide by Federal and State Wage and Hour laws, as well as the documents referenced above. These provide for monetary payment at the rate of time and one-half for any hours in excess of 40 worked by a nonexempt employee during the employee's workweek. (Attendance at some instructional classes may be considered as work under the Federal and State Wage and Hour laws.)\nAlthough it is permissible, with the supervisor's approval, for a nonexempt staff employee to alter when the 40 hours are worked during the workweek, such employee cannot \"bank\" overtime hours worked in one workweek for use as time off in a future workweek. Further, the employee must understand that altered schedules cannot cause overtime to occur. While it is possible for an employee to agree to waive University overtime policies on work schedules to accommodate personal schedule preferences, Federal and State Wage and Hour laws cannot be waived.\nRequired Approval\nWhen an employee desires a change in working hours, the employee should submit the request in writing to the immediate supervisor, with a copy to the employee's Human Resources Representative. The supervisor shall provide an answer in writing. Although every effort should be made to accommodate the request, permission to change working hours is a special arrangement and privilege and should not be considered as a right. It is granted only when the supervisor believes that the requested change will not interfere with the efficient operation of the employee's regular University duties or the needs of the area. Requests submitted based on a need such as family care or car pooling will be given primary consideration. Otherwise, length of service will be the guiding consideration.\nAn area, which has established a flexible work schedule, may discontinue or alter the flexible schedule if work needs so dictate. Two calendar weeks notice of this change will be given to employees, unless the change is caused by an emergency.\nNOTE: Assistance in administering or questions on this policy should be directed to the appropriate Human Resources Representative or the Employee Relations Division of the Office of Human Resources at (814) 865-1412.\nTELECOMMUTING:\nThe University's establishment of a telecommuting program assists in meeting the needs of a workforce that has diverse work and personal demands. Telecommuting can provide flexible work schedules to accommodate temporary situations such as a leave due to a contagious illness or a temporary disability (such as a cold or a broken leg), an unexpected school closing, etc. In addition, telecommuting can provide flexibility on a long-term basis.\nA telecommuting program also allows the University to address emerging environmental compliance issues, such as the Clean Air Act and to comply with legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, telecommuting provides alternate methods of addressing budget issues. Finally, a telecommuting program can strengthen management and employee relations.\nFactors of Successful Telecommuting\nThe telecommuters, supervisors, and actual jobs involved in a successful telecommuting arrangement have the following characteristics:\nCharacteristics of a Telecommuter\nA successful telecommuter is a highly disciplined, self-directed, and self-motivated individual, capable of balancing work and personal demands. In addition, the telecommuter must be able to function in an environment that is less structured and more autonomous than a traditional work environment. This type of arrangement can be successful only if the telecommuter has demonstrated good organization and time management skills. In many cases, the telecommuter will have to be computer literate.\nIn the past, performance emphasis has not been placed solely on results, but also included externalities such as the employee's presence and presentation. Since telecommuters do not have the luxury of putting in the proverbial appearances, they must focus almost exclusively on the bottom line because it is the results that will make their presence felt. Those results have to be good if telecommuting is to succeed.\nTelecommuters have to adjust to being isolated from daily co-worker interactions. Some may compensate for the lack of social interactions in the office by keeping in contact by phone, e-mail, etc. However, some people may dismiss the possibility of telecommuting knowing that they need social contact on a regular basis in order to work productively.\nCharacteristics of a Supervisor\nThe supervisor of a telecommuter must be open to new ideas, be trusting of employees, and be a good communicator. Performance is monitored and managed by results rather than by traditional observations. (See PERFORMANCE EVALUATION section below.)\nCharacteristics of a Job\nNot all jobs are adapted easily to a telecommuting arrangement. Jobs that are adapted easily include those that consist of writing, reading, researching, independent thinking, editing, and working with data. The job probably should not be dependent on access to other University employees (other than by electronic mail) and physical materials. The job should have an independent function, be more technology and information driven, and have measurable duties.\nResponsibilities for Successful Telecommuting\nTelecommuters\nThe telecommuter needs to be continually aware of University guidelines, policies and practices. Close communication between the telecommuter and the supervisor will ensure that the employee is aware of any departmental or University priorities. Quality customer service will continue to be a top priority, including customer service and service among colleagues within the department. This includes awareness of training required both for the telecommuter and for colleagues who will be interacting with them. When establishing a telecommuting schedule, the needs of the office and the customers must be taken into account.\nThe telecommuter is responsible for ensuring that the established business hours are adhered to. Just as procrastinating and being distracted by non-work items can result in failure, so can overwork. A disadvantage of telecommuting is that it provides 24-hour access to work. Working too much causes stress and stress-related illness, burnout, and reduced productivity. Knowing when to stop is essential to good job performance.\nOne key to telecommuting success lies in creating a work area at home that is used strictly for work. Once the office area is established, home-based employees should train those people (e.g., family members) who see them there to think of them as working.\nSupervisors\nThe supervisor is responsible for exploring and evaluating the business rationale for a telecommuting arrangement, with quality customer service as a top priority. Human as well as financial resources need to be examined. Start-up expenses as well as ongoing telecommuting costs need to be projected. Once a telecommuting arrangement is established, periodic cost\/benefit analyses can be helpful in re-exploring the success of the arrangement.\nThe supervisor needs to insure that the telecommuter is included in pertinent staff meetings and training sessions. As well, regular communication and updates between the supervisor and telecommuter are imperative. As with any employee, clear performance guidelines and periodic performance reviews are essential.\nThe supervisor should evaluate very carefully what computer access and interfaces should be given to the telecommuter. In order to avoid any potential issues, only access that is imperative to the telecommuter's daily work function should be granted. The supervisor is responsible for documenting the need for access to any computer programs (e.g., Internet, IBIS). Last, as with all computer and workspace arrangements, all workspaces will be expected to follow Penn State's ergonomic guidelines (http:\/\/ehs.psu.edu\/).\nThe supervisor should schedule regular meetings with the telecommuter to assess needs, give feedback, discuss problems, and just catch up. Doing this avoids the feeling of losing contact, and the telecommuter will feel less isolated. Holding regular meetings to set timetables and assess progress gives employees deadlines to keep them on target. When face-to-face meetings are not possible, other means, such as mail and telephone, should be utilized to keep the lines of communication open.\nThe supervisor should review the telecommuting arrangements periodically and make necessary adjustments in order to address any changing business demands.\nEstablishing A Telecommuting Program:\nEstablishment of telecommuting programs is encouraged whenever possible. However, a telecommuting arrangement is a privilege and not a right. As outlined above, not all employees and not all jobs are suited to telecommuting. An employee interested in telecommuting first should present a proposal to her\/his supervisor with a copy to the Human Resources Representative. This proposal should include:\nthe reason for the request\nthe length of time that the telecommuting arrangement is desired\nthe number of hours-per-day or days-per-week that the employee will be telecommuting - including when (what days\/hours) the employee will be accessible\na description of the impact on customers in terms of service and quality of work\nan explanation of how necessary communication with University offices and customers will be maintained\nthe daily hours when the telecommuter is accessible to coworkers and customers\na list of duties to be performed while telecommuting\na list of the necessary equipment and where\/how\/by whom it will be obtained and maintained\npotential problem areas (if any)\nThe supervisor then reviews the proposal with the Human Resources Representative and the Employee Relations Division of the Office of Human Resources. If a telecommuting arrangement is feasible, then the supervisor discusses all aspects of the telecommuting arrangement with the employee and reaches a written agreement with the employee. The written agreement includes all of the factors listed above and a clear delineation of whom is responsible for:\ntelephone costs (if any)\nsupplies (paper, pens, etc.)\ncomputer set-up and maintenance, installation of and\/or training on computer software\nsecurity of University equipment, materials, and supplies (including responsibility for loss)\nany additional applicable items\nAny required travel that ordinarily would be considered as normal commuting to and from work is not reimbursed. Required travel elsewhere may be reimbursed per University travel policies. Finally, the agreement should include a provision for the modification or termination of the agreement should either University or employee needs change.\nInsurance Coverage\nWorkers' Compensation coverage applies for those employees working at home. However, prior to implementation of the telecommuting arrangement, the Workers' Compensation and Environmental Health Offices must be contacted to work with the telecommuter and her\/his supervisor in setting up physical telecommuting arrangements to ensure safety of equipment set-up, etc., to avoid unnecessary injuries, as well as to assess the ergonomic set-up of the telecommuting equipment. All workspaces will be expected to follow  Penn State's ergonomics guidelines.\nChild Care\nTelecommuting may not be a good alternative for child care. If the job duties can be performed at hours outside of the traditional 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., when the child is sleeping or alternate care is available, then telecommuting may be a good alternative. Otherwise, it is difficult to work effectively while trying to care for small children. Trying to do both at once usually means that the individual is neither an effective worker nor an effective parent. This is a conflict that needs to be resolved before commencing telecommuting.\nResources\nQuestions regarding this program should be referred to the Telecommuting Consulting Team (Office of Human Resources, Academic Services and Emerging Technologies, Telecommunications and Networking Services, and Environmental Health and Safety) at telecommute@psu.edu.\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS:\nEstablishment of performance goals, and subsequent reviews, should focus on measurable results rather than traditional on-the-job behaviors and performance. Thus, measurable interim goals can help ensure that targeted resultant goals are met in a timely, acceptable fashion. Other performance criteria should also be established. For example, is the telecommuter to call the office on a regular basis or attend regular staff meetings?\nWhen setting objectives and giving performance feedback, the following should be remembered:\nemployee participation promotes acceptance of the manager's observations - employees who are allowed to voice opinions will be more satisfied with the feedback\nsetting specific performance objectives rather than general ones clarifies exactly what is expected of the employee\nproductivity improvement is more likely if problem areas are discussed right away\ncriticism triggers defensive reactions - talking about how something can be improved, rather than spending too much time on the downside of an employee's work, can be more productive\nreward the employee for work well done - employees respond much better to positive feedback than to criticism\nObjectives, should be clearly defined, with measurable output such as completed reports or written codes. These can be measured in quantity, quality, and time-to-complete. Care should be taken not to over-measure; not every task can be evaluated in quantitative terms. Measuring productivity and performance should not be different for on-site and off-site employees. A good system for measuring output should be equally effective for both employees on-site as well as those working at home.\nEvaluate individual work as well as group work. Telecommuters may sustain or even increase individual productivity levels, but their group work may suffer because they are not staying in touch with co-workers.\nLIMITATIONS:\nImplementation of alternate work arrangements must be in accordance with the provisions of:\nHR34, Employment Conditions for Staff Employees\nThe professional Agreement between The Pennsylvania State University and the Pennsylvania Nurses Association.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nCellular Usage Agreement for Pooled Devices.\nHR34 - Employment Conditions for Staff Employees\nFN14 - Use of Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services\nCHANGES:\n6\/20\/08 - Updated Penn State's ergonomics guidelines link.\n7\/27\/06 - Name changes in Resources Section; The former Center for Academic Computing is now Academic Services and Emerging Technologies and the former Office of Telecommunications is now Telecommunications and Networking Services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To provide guidance for areas in establishing alternate work arrangements for faculty and staff whose responsibilities can be accomplished outside of a University office and\/or traditional work schedule for part or all of the workweek. Such arrangements are encouraged when, in the opinion of the supervisor, the University's work needs can be efficiently and effectively met. The purpose of flexible work schedules is to provide a greater capability for each employee to establish her\/his own program of working hours within the workweek without changing the number of hours to be worked. Telecommuting is a work arrangement in which employees, for a portion of their scheduled work hours, perform their regular job responsibilities away from their primary business location utilizing telecommunication and information technology as appropriate. These arrangements can be either temporary or ongoing.University and departmental demands are a priority throughout any alternative work arrangement - the arrangement must be transparent to customers in terms of service and quality. Alternative work arrangements are flexible and subject to change as business needs change."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad35","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Archives and Records Management  | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesUniversity Archives and Records Management  \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD35\nUniversity Archives and Records Management \nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\n\u200b\nContents:\nPurpose\nScope\nDefinition of Terms \nGeneral\nArchival Records\nUniversity Records\nRecords Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedules\n\nPolicy\nRetention\nRegular Review of University Records\nPermanent Preservation of Records in the University Archives\nAuthorization for Reformatting Records\nDestruction of University Records\nLegal Hold\n\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nSCOPE:\nThis policy is applicable to all areas, locations, campuses, offices and units (hereinafter referred to as \"Units\" of the University). A Records Management Liaison, hereinafter referred to as a \"RML,\" must be appointed for each Unit to serve as steward for those records in conjunction with University Archives\/Records Management Program.\u00a0 Certain Units that store and maintain institutional records may have individual guidelines which supplement, but do not supplant, this policy.\nThe record retention guidelines that correspond with this policy apply only to the originating Unit, the Unit responsible for action related to the record(s), and\/or the originating employee.\u00a0 Other Units or employees receiving copies of these records should retain such copies only as long as useful, but in no event longer than the record retention guidelines.\u00a0 Where multiple Units are responsible for action related to a single record, those Units should agree as to which will be responsible for record retention.\u00a0 The objective is to minimize the number of copies kept while ensuring that records are retained as required.\nDEFINITION OF TERMS:\nArchival Records - University records which are non-current and are not required to be retained in the office in which they originate or are received.\u00a0 These records have permanent or enduring legal, fiscal, research or historical value and, in consequence thereof, should be retained and preserved indefinitely.\nBorn Digital Records \u2013 University records created and maintained in digital format throughout their life span.\nDisposable (or Transactional) Records - University records which have temporary value and, in consequence thereof, may be destroyed after the lapse of a specified period of time delineated in Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedules, specified by federal or state law, or after the occurrence of some act which renders them valueless, in accordance with policy.\nElectronic Records \u2013 Electronic records are created and stored in a wide variety of technologies; for example, email, data (in structured or unstructured formats), web pages and other \u201cborn digital\u201d records.\u00a0 Any of these technologies are used to store University records. As such, AD35 applies to all University records that are electronic.\u00a0\nFaculty Personal Papers \u2013 information and\/or documents that are maintained at the sole discretion of a faculty member for scholarly purposes that shall not contain personally identifiable information (that is, social security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, state ID numbers, passport numbers, biometric data, or protected health information, as defined by AD53 \u2013 Privacy Policy) of any member of the University community, including, but not limited to, students, scholars, faculty, lecturers\/instructors, staff, and third-party vendors.\nFaculty-Related Records \u2013 University records that typically are created, maintained, kept, or stored by University faculty.\u00a0 See the General Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule for more information.\nFinancial Document Retention Schedule - a list indicating the length of time specific financial records must be retained before disposition, as well as the appropriate means of disposition for each series of records.\nGeneral Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule - a list indicating the length of time general records must be retained before disposition, as well as the appropriate means of disposition for each series of records.\nInformation Classification - See policy AD95, Information Assurance and IT Security.\nRecord Series - any groups of related records which are normally used and filed as a unit and which can be evaluated as a unit for disposition purposes.\nRecords Management Liaisons (RML)\u2013 University employees assigned by the Budget Executive to serve as a conduit for policy, procedure, and information between the University Archives\/Records Management Program and their respective administrative area.\u00a0\nRecords Management Assistants (RMA)\u2013 University employees designated to support the Records Management Liaison with specific responsibility for a unit or units within the administrative area.\nRetention Period - the time that must elapse before the records are disposed, stored or archived.\nUniversity Essential Records\u00a0- Records essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of the University during and after an emergency, and also those records essential to protecting the rights and interests of the University and the individuals directly affected by its activities. Permanent records within this category would be transferred to the University Archives at the end of their life cycle as delineated in the retention schedules.\nUniversity Records - Information that documents a transaction or regularly conducted activity of the University and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law, University policy, or in connection with a transaction, business, or activity of the University.\u00a0 The term includes documents, papers, letters, books, drawings, maps, plans, photographs, tapes, film or sound recordings, microforms, digital or analog files, information stored or maintained electronically, and data- or image-processed documents.\nExcluded from the definition of University records are three categories of materials:\nUniversity library and museum material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes, stocks of publications and of processed documents, and extra copies of documents preserved only for convenience of reference;\nFaculty Personal Papers that are maintained at the sole discretion of a faculty member for scholarly purposes that shall not contain personally identifiable information; and\nPersonal papers not related to the official function of a Unit or created in pursuance of non-University activities.\n\u00a0\nGENERAL:\nARCHIVAL RECORDS:\nTo promote its mission of teaching, research, and service, the University has decided to make available certain University records in custody of the University Archives\u00a0for\u00a0inspection, copying, and general research use, subject to those constraints that\u00a0may apply by virtue of federal or state law or regulation, University policies,\u00a0guidelines, or standards.\nUNIVERSITY RECORDS:\nRegardless of format, University records have a life span. When University records\u00a0eventually become inactive, the University will determine the most appropriate disposition of these records in the interest of\u00a0\u00a0economy, efficiency, history, or administrative necessity.\u00a0Records either will be designated as permanent with the Unit, as archival records and transferred to the custody of the University Archives, or\u00a0will be designated as Disposable records and destroyed in a systematic manner as outlined in this policy. Designations are delineated by record series in the Records Retention, Disposition, and Destruction Schedules.\nUniversity records in custody of their originating and receiving offices are University property and may not be disposed of except through policy and guidelines established herein. Access to University records still in originating or receiving offices is governed by statute, regulation, or existing University policies and guidelines. Records from offices which are merged in reorganizations should be brought into the new offices carrying out those functions; records from those offices which are phased out should be reviewed by the University Archives\/Records Management Program for appropriate action.\u00a0\u00a0\nRECORDS RETENTION, DISPOSITION AND DESTRUCTION SCHEDULES:\nSchedules will be developed for particular categories of records and for the records of a particular office.\u00a0 All general schedules shall be included in the Penn State Policies website as part of the General Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule.\u00a0 Disposition information for specific financial forms is included as Financial Document Retention Schedule in the Penn State Policies website.\nPurpose of the Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule: To provide uniform, effective, and systematic control of record keeping and destruction. Ensures that valuable records are preserved and that records of a temporary nature are properly disposed of when no longer needed.\nSteps in creating schedules: The University Archives\/Records Management Program surveys records and drafts retention, disposition, and destruction recommendations; proposed schedules are approved by officials primarily concerned with the records; proposed schedules are then reviewed and approved by the Records Management Advisory Committee, the Office of General Counsel, and the Office of the President.\nPOLICY:\n\nRETENTION:\n\t\tWhere possible, Units should store the original University record(s), including records retained as samples or models, in a central file or on a shared server rather than maintaining several copies in various employee offices. Employees should consider whether they are an official source for a particular record when determining whether retention of additional copies of that record is necessary.\n\nREGULAR REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY RECORDS:\n\t\tUnits shall annually review the records in their possession and under their operational jurisdiction, and document such review.\u00a0 The regulations defined in this policy must be consulted and followed in determining the retention, disposition and destruction of the records they manage.\n\u00a0\n\t\tThe Budget Executive will be responsible for the certification of such a review in his or her administrative area, certifying that the area is in compliance with AD35 to the best of his or her knowledge and belief. To this end, the area's Budget Administrator, Department Head(s), Unit Head(s)and Director\/s \u00a0and\/or other administrators, as applicable and as designated by the Budget Executive, will support\u00a0him\/her in the certification process. In fulfilling this process, the Budget Executive will designate one (1) primary RML to oversee such a review for his or her administrative area. There should be a minimum of one primary RML per administrative area. Based on the size of the Unit, an RML has the option to designate additional individuals, hereinafter referred to as Records Management Assistants (RMA), to support the RML.\n\u00a0\n\t\tDocumentation of this review will be maintained by the Unit RML as evidence that the review was conducted.\u00a0 The RML can document what records were reviewed through whatever means is most efficient and effective for the administrative area.\n\u00a0\n\t\tNote that records retained on centrally provided servers, such as in Administrative Information Systems (AIS), fall under the responsibility of the Unit that generated, collected, or maintained the records (as opposed to the Unit that manages the centrally provided server).\n\nPERMANENT PRESERVATION OF RECORDS IN THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES:\n\nESSENTIAL\u00a0RECORDS:\nUniversity essential\u00a0records shall\u00a0be transferred to the University Archives, as delineated in the Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedules.\n\n\nARCHIVAL RECORDS MUST BE TRANSFERRED:\nArchival records as designated in the Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedules, must be transferred to the University Archives for permanent preservation. The University Archives\/Records Management Program shall designate which records are archival and shall have the authority to examine any and all University records in their offices of origin, subject to possible conditions of national security classification.\n\n\nARCHIVAL RECORDS CREATED MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS PRIOR TO CURRENT DATE:\nAny archival records created more than twenty (20) years prior to the current date must be transferred to the University Archives.\n\n\nTRANSFER OF ARCHIVAL RECORDS:\nThe transfer of archival records from the Unit of origin to the University Archives shall be made at such times and in the manner and form prescribed by the University Archives and subject to the appropriate Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedules.\n\n\nUNIVERSITY RECORDS DEPOSITED IN THE ARCHIVES:\nUniversity records deposited in the University Archives shall be subject\u00a0to the information classifications defined in University Policy AD95 and its corresponding Security Standards. University records maintained in the University Archives that contain information classified as \"Low\" or \"Moderate\" are closed to public access until twenty (20) years after their date of creation. University records maintained in the University Archives that contain information classified as \"Restricted\" or \"High\" are closed to public access until their status is changed by the Office of the\u00a0President via a written request submitted by the University Archivist. Information classified as \"Low,\" but made available to the public by the University prior to transfer to the University Archives, may be made available upon processing.\n\n\nUNIVERSITY ARCHIVAL RECORDS MAY BE USED BY ANY INDIVIDUAL:\nUniversity archival records may be used by any individual, subject to their agreement to abide by archival rules governing access and use.\n\n\nREQUESTS FOR EXCEPTIONS:\nA requests for an exception to access records that contain information classified as \"Low\" or \"Moderate\" information, as defined in AD95, shall be submitted in writing to the University Archivist\/Records Management Advisory Committeee who shall be governed by criteria approved by the Office of General Counsel and the Office of the President (or the President's designated representative) for evaluating such requests.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAUTHORIZATION FOR REFORMATTING RECORDS:\n\nPURPOSE OF REFORMATTING RECORDS:\nUniversity records may be microfilmed, and\/or scanned for storage in optical or other electronic media, for the purpose of reducing storage costs and\/or improving access to and manipulability of the data.\u00a0 Documentation of reformatting process and procedures must be maintained. Physical or electronic records containing information classified as \"Restricted\" or \"High\" may be digitized or reformatted, but must be securely stored, with proper access controls, as defined in AD95.\n\n\nQUALITY STANDARDS FOR REFORMATTING UNIVERSITY RECORDS:\nAll significant detail on originals must be included on the new medium.\u00a0 Reformatted reproductions must have the same acceptability and legal status as the original record.\u00a0 The reformatted reproduction must meet archival standards. Reformatted records retain their original information classification pursuant to AD95.\n\n\nUNITS MUST PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION:\nUnits must provide advance notification to the University Archives\/Records Management Program of their intent to reformat records. Such Units must show that space savings and\/or improved access to information will result from reformatting, as well as meeting quality and metadata standards.\u00a0 No reformatting shall take place unless an approved Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule exists which covers the records in question.\u00a0 All notifications of reformatting will be checked against established standards.\n\n\nMASTER RECORDS OF MICROFILMED RECORDS:\nMaster negatives of microfilmed records which are identified as archival will be transferred to the University Archives for inclusion in the \"Essential\u00a0Records\" master negative storage program.\u00a0 Original archival records which have been microfilmed may be destroyed if the use-copies of the microfilm are scheduled for later transfer to the University Archives.\u00a0 Original archival records which are scanned or otherwise converted for digital storage shall be transferred to the Archives unless an Archives-acceptable copy of the information can be provided for Archives storage.\n\n\nUNIVERSITY RECORDS WHICH ARE DETERMINED TO BE DISPOSABLE:\nUniversity records which are determined to be disposable may be stored on any medium that ensures the maintenance of the information until its designated disposal point.\u00a0 Units should submit notifications of intent to dispose of non-archival originals. \u00a0Notices of intent to dispose are also required for reformatted records whenever they are ready for disposal.\n\n\n\nDESTRUCTION OF UNIVERSITY RECORDS:\n\n\nAUTHORITY FOR DESTRUCTION:\nNo destruction shall take place unless an approved Records Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule exists which covers the records in question.\u00a0Questions about documents not covered should be directed to the University Archives\/Records Management Program.\n\n\nTHE MANNER OF DESTRUCTION OR ARCHIVAL TRANSFER OF RECORDS:\nUnits may submit notifications of intent to dispose or transfer, or they will be notified on a regular basis of the need to dispose of records; those record series which require disposition will be listed and offices will be required to complete the disposal and notify the University Archives\/Records Management Program, indicating the means by which disposal was completed and the amount of material destroyed.\u00a0 Transfer guidelines will be provided by the University Archives\/Records Management Program upon request.\n\n\nTHE MANNER OF DESTRUCTION OF DISPOSABLE (OR TRANSACTIONAL) RECORDS:\nThe manner of destruction of disposable (or transactional) records will depend on the classification of University records destroyed. Records containing information classified as \"Restricted,\" \"High\" or \"Moderate\" (including, but not limited to, any records containing unecrypted or unredacted personally identifiable information) must be shredded. Records containing information classified as \"Low\" should be recycled. For electronic records, see the Electronic Data Disposal and Media Sanitization Standard adopted as a supplement to AD95.\n\n\nDESTRUCTION OF DRAFTS\n\t\tUnits may retain drafts of any document during preparation. Upon finalization of the record, however, Units will retain only the final record, and all prior drafts shall be destroyed or deleted, as applicable, in accordance with this Policy. Once a document is slated for destruction under this Policy, all drafts of that document (both paper and electronic) must be destroyed.\n\nLEGAL HOLD:\n\t\tThe destruction of records, documents, drafts, and copies will be suspended immediately upon notice that an investigation or litigation is pending, imminent, or reasonably foreseeable. The suspension will be tailored to cover only those records, documents, drafts, and copies relevant to the investigation or litigation.\n\t\tRetention procedures will be suspended when, in the judgment of the University\u2019s Office of General Counsel, a record or group of records should be placed on a legal hold.\u00a0 A legal hold requires preservation of appropriate records under special circumstances, such as litigation or government investigations. \u00a0The Office of General Counsel determines and identifies what records and documents are required to be placed under a legal hold.\n\u00a0\n\t\tMembers of the University community will be notified if a legal hold is placed on records for which they are responsible.\u00a0 Members of the University community are then required to locate, index, segregate, and protect the necessary hard copy records and records in electronic form, in conjunction with the Office of Information Security and local Information Technology staff, where appropriate.\u00a0 Any record that is relevant to a legal hold must be retained and preserved.\u00a0 If a member of the University community is unsure whether a record is relevant to a legal hold, that member of the University community should protect that record until consultation with the Office of General Counsel.\n\u00a0\n\t\tA legal hold remains effective until it is released in writing by the Office of General Counsel. After the University community receives written notice of the lifting of a legal hold, all records relevant to the legal hold shall return to their normal handling procedures and retention schedules.\n\u00a0\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the University Archivist, Special Collections Library.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD11 - University Policy on Confidentiality of Student Records\nAD20 - Computer and Network Security\nAD22  - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nAD23 - Use of Institutional Data\nAD34  - University Recycling Program\nAD53  - Privacy Policy\nADG01 - Glossary of Computer Data and System Terminology\nADG02 - Computer Security (formerly Computer Facility Security Guideline)\nADG08 - Collection, Storage and Authorized Use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and Penn State Identification Numbers\nBS15  - Disposal and Purchase of Obsolete, Surplus or Scrap University-Owned Equipment, Supplies and\/or Materials\nFN14 - Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies, and Services\nFN19  - Policy for Handling and Distributing Confidential Internal Audit Reports and Other Documents\nHR60 - Access to Personnel Files\nIP01  - IP01 Ownership and Management of Intellectual Property (Formerly RA11 - Patents and Copyrights [Intellectual Property])\nPenn State Policies Appendices General Retention, Disposition and Destruction Schedule and Financial Document Retention Schedule\nUniversity Records FAQs\n\u00a0\nMost Recent Changes:\nApril 17, 2018 - Edited to clarify the DEFINITION OF TERMS, and revised the POLICY section to reference\u00a0AD95.

If the grievance is not settled to the employee's satisfaction after completion of the Affirmative Action Office investigation, the employee may appeal it to the Final Step Review outlined below.\nINFORMAL RESOLUTION OF GRIEVANCE:\nMost grievances and on-the-job conflicts can be settled in discussions between the employee and the employee's supervisor. In some situations, the employee may wish to seek the counsel of his or her Human Resources Representative and\/or the Employee Relations Division in the central Office of Human Resources. In the event of alleged discrimination, counsel may be sought from the Affirmative Action Office.\nWithin one (1) calendar week of the time that the employee has knowledge of the act which is the basis for the grievance, an employee who wishes to pursue a grievance shall discuss the matter with his or her supervisor, unless there are substantial extenuating factors that prevent meeting this time limit. The supervisor shall respond orally to the grievance within two (2) workdays of the discussion.\nSTEP ONE:\nIf the employee is not satisfied with the supervisor's response, the employee may put the grievance in writing within three (3) workdays of the date of the response.

A written answer shall be provided to the employee(s) within ten (10) workdays of the date of the hearing.\nFINAL STEP:\nIf the employee is not satisfied with the Step Two response, the employee may request a Final Step Review, in writing, within seven (7) workdays of the Step Two response. This request shall include the employee's position on the relevant issue(s)and the reasons for disagreement with the Step Two response. (As noted in the Discrimination Grievance section herein, if the employee is not satisfied after completion of the Affirmative Action Office process, the employee may request a Final Step Review. Such request will be made in writing within seven (7) workdays of the Affirmative Action Office's conclusion of the matter.)\nThis review is conducted by the Vice President for Human Resources or a designee. The review may include meetings and discussions with individuals, including the employee, whom the Vice President for Human Resources, or his or her designee, deems necessary in order to gather the information needed to render a decision. Following a review of the employee's Final Step Review request, the Step Two answer, and other relevant materials, a written response will be provided to the employee. The Final Step Review decision is final.\nMISCELLANEOUS:\nIf the employee gets a response at any step of the procedure and does not ask for further review of the grievance within the specified time limit, further review is deemed waived and it will be assumed that the employee is satisfied.\nAt any step, University representatives and\/or the employee may invite people to present factual testimony in the hearing.\nAn employee will not lose pay for any time that he or she is required to be present in any step of this grievance procedure. An employee will not be paid for any time that he or she is present during the grievance procedure, if this time falls outside the employee's normal working hours.\nIn accordance with the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization (\"VAWA\"), all grievances related to reports of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking (as defined in AD85) shall be referred to the Affirmative Action Office for investigation and disposition in accordance with procedures established by that office.

All drivers must be 21 years or older.\nThe University retains the right to periodically check driver motor vehicle records and establish criteria to exclude employees from driving on business.\nEmployees between ages 18 and 21 may only drive University vehicles if:\nThey have documented completion of a University-sponsored driver training program (which can be found by accessing the Online Driver Safety Training Course) during the time of their University employment;\nTheir Motor Vehicle Record has been checked by the University's Office of Human Resources and found to contain no major moving violations; AND\nDriving is a significant responsibility of their approved job description.\nEmployees under the age of 21 may also act as a relief driver when accompanying a faculty or staff member on a long trip (4 hours or more each direction), without regard to items a-c above.\nStudents: Undergraduate students are normally not permitted to drive University-owned, leased or rented vehicles. A student can only serve as a driver for University business (other than a relief driver as described above) if they meet the requirements above AND if they are acting as an employee as part of the trip, AND driving a vehicle is part of their University job description. However, students may act as relief drivers when accompanying a faculty or staff member on a long trip (4 hours or more each direction). In the case of a rental vehicle, a student relief driver must be properly insured for the vehicle being driven, by noting the additional driver on the rental agreement at the time the vehicle is rented. Students employed on \u201cwork-study\u201d assignments are NOT permitted to drive vehicles, as a condition of their federal funding.\nFamily Member Relief Drivers: In addition to the above provisions permitting employees under the age of 21 and University students to act as relief drivers, family members of University employees may also act as relief drivers when accompanying a faculty or staff member on a trip of 4 hours or more duration in each direction. All family member relief drivers must be 18 years or older. In the case of a rental vehicle, the relief driver must be properly insured for the vehicle being driven, by noting the additional driver on the rental agreement at the time the vehicle is rented.\nNOTE: University vehicles are not to be parked at an employee's home overnight. Exceptions may be granted if the vehicle will be used for an early departure (prior to 7:00 a.m.) or a late return (after 7:00 p.m.) and\/or the individual would reduce driving time to or from the final destination by taking the vehicle home the evening before or returning it the next day. Exceptions must be approved by the Budget Administrator whose budget will incur the University-owned vehicle charge (or the Budget Administrator's immediate supervisor if the Budget Administrator is the one using the vehicle). Even if an exception is granted, the vehicle cannot be used for personal use.\nOPERATING LICENSE:\nAll drivers must possess a valid driver\u2019s license issued by a state of the United States or by a Province of Canada. An overseas or international driver\u2019s license does not meet eligibility requirements.\nTOWING:\nThe towing of trailers and equipment by motor vehicles on University business presents liability exposure to the University and the drivers of the towing vehicles, as well as concerns for the safety of University employees and equipment. In light of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code (PA Title 75, which addresses motor vehicles, including trailers), and the insurance industry practice of insuring a trailer in tandem with the vehicle towing the trailer (known as the \"power unit\"), all University owned, hired, or leased trailers shall be towed by University owned, hired or leased power units. The towing of University owned, hired, or leased trailers by personally-owned vehicles is not permitted.\nPower units shall be sufficiently designed and capable for the trailer and cargo, and the University\u2019s Fleet Operations Office should be contacted to help evaluate the proper power unit and trailer.\nTRUCK RENTAL:\nFrom time to time University units may need to rent trucks from commercial vendors such as Budget, Ryder and Penske. The operation of these rentals is subject to the same rules and conditions as set forth above and applicable Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Law as well as other states and federal regulations.\nWhen renting a truck from a vendor, the unit must adhere to the following:\nIf the rental is 30 days or less - the CDW (Collision Damage Waiver) and supplemental liability coverage must be purchased from the vendor. The University\u2019s preferred coverages and limits are as follows:\nCollision Damage Waiver (CDW): full coverage for the replacement cost of the truck.\nSupplemental Liability Coverage: $100,000 bodily injury per person\/$300,000 bodily injury per accident\/$50,000 property damage.\n\nIf the rental is more than 30 days - please contact the Risk Management Office for insurance coverage.\nINSURANCE FOR UNIVERSITY-OWNED OR LEASED VEHICLES:\nThe University maintains liability insurance on its vehicles as required by the Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Act, as well as physical damage coverage which includes a $1,000 collision and $500 comprehensive deductible. The responsible department will be charged these deductible amounts, should damage occur. University vehicles are covered while operated in the United States and Canada.\nNOTE: The University's contracts with National Car Rental and Enterprise Rent-A-Car include primary auto liability and collision damage to the vehicle itself. The University has elected NOT to purchase \"personal property\" coverage which is an option available to the renter, and for University business the payment of this expense is NOT reimbursable.\nVEHICLE ACCIDENT REPORTING:\nAny accident involving a vehicle (owned, leased, rented or personally-owned) driven on University business, must be reported by the driver to the Risk Management Office within 24 hours, using the Vehicle Accident Report Form. If a rental or personally owned vehicle is involved in an accident while used on University business, no matter how minor, it must be reported to the Risk Management Office. The Vehicle Accident Report Form may be found in the visor pack of fleet-serviced vehicles. For other vehicles, a copy of the form can be accessed on-line at http:\/\/controller.psu.edu\/claims (see the \"Auto Liability\" section). The driver is responsible for completing both sides of the form.\nDriver Responsibilities:\nIn the event of accident resulting in a serious injury, death, non-drivability of the vehicle, or an alleged hit and run, you MUST contact the police.\nIf you are involved in an accident involving serious injuries or death, you should also notify the Risk Management Office at 814-863-5539.\nIf a Fleet vehicle is damaged so extensively that it cannot be driven, you should also notify Fleet Operations at 814-865-7572.\nShould an accident occur when driving a rental vehicle on University business, the driver must also notify the rental agency as well as the police, no matter how minor the accident.\nFINES, TOLLS AND PARKING FEES:\nAll University drivers are responsible for any tolls, parking fees or violations\/fines incurred while using a vehicle while on University business. Tolls and parking fees will be reimbursable as listed in the \"Transportation\" section of the Penn State Travel Policy. Violations and fines will not be reimbursed by the University.\nAuxiliary and Business Services is the initial contact for unpaid violations\/fines written on University vehicles. Violation documents are received which contain a license number of the vehicle in question. Utilizing their Vehicle Registration System, Auxiliary and Business Services personnel will search and locate the unit\/department associated with that license number. If the license number identifies the vehicle as a Fleet Operations vehicle, Auxiliary and Business Services will forward the violation document to Fleet Operations for resolution. If the vehicle is not identified as a Fleet vehicle, Auxiliary and Business Services will contact the applicable unit\/department on file for that vehicle for resolution. Once Auxiliary and Business Services contacts the appropriate responsible department, it will be that department\u2019s responsibility to resolve the situation.\nUnits\/departments\/drivers should be aware that if violations are not paid or properly appealed within the prescribed time, the driver may be subject to any summons or warrants for arrest issued against the unpaid violation.\nFLEET OPERATIONS VEHICLES:\nThe Department of Transportation Services\u2019 Fleet Operations, a division of the Office of Auxiliary and Business Services of The Pennsylvania State University, has the responsibility for providing safe and well-maintained vehicles for the official business and travel needs of the University. Fleet Operations also provides professional driver services for University business and special events coordinated through the Nittany Lion Inn, Penn Stater Conference Center Hotel, or Pasquerilla Spiritual Center. Fleet Operations has the sole authority for the purchase and management of University passenger vehicles, the assignment and scheduling of reservations, and the scheduling of all maintenance and repairs for Fleet vehicles. This policy should not be confused with the University\u2019s Travel Policy.\nFleet Vehicle Program Eligibility:\nUniversity employees 21 years of age or older\nValid United States (issued by a \u201cstate\u201d), or Canadian Province Operator\u2019s license\nNOTE: An overseas or international driver\u2019s license does not meet eligibility requirements.\n\nUndergraduate students are not authorized to reserve, sign for, or operate Fleet vehicles. They may, however, act as a relief driver when accompanying a faculty or staff member. The faculty or staff member must be present in the vehicle (see \u201cWho May Drive On University Business,\u201d above).\nUnder extenuating circumstances, exceptions may be considered when certain established criteria have been met and proper advanced approvals have been given, in writing, by Fleet Operations. Requests for exception must be provided and signed by the Dean of the College or the Department Head for review\/approval, and must include the following:\nStudent\u2019s name and PSU ID number.\nPosition title\/brief description of student\u2019s role\/work duties.\nWhy is driving a University vehicle necessary in this student\u2019s work for the unit?\nHiring college\/unit and department.\nBudget and Fund covering various vehicle reservations.\n\nNOTE: Graduate students with assistantships and serving as part-time teaching assistants are considered employees for purposes of Fleet vehicle rental. Please note that this exception to policy does not waive the basic Fleet eligibility requirement.\nReserving A Fleet Vehicle:\nTo submit a \u201crequest,\u201d authorized personnel (those employees given ADBA access by their Financial Officers via the Financial Officer notification system in IBIS) may submit a request via the web-based \u201cFleet Vehicle Reservation Form\" found at https:\/\/www.absecom.psu.edu\/DTS_Fleet_VRES\/PUBLIC\/WELCOME_WIN.cfm.\nAll student organizations must go through the Student Affairs Office at 240 HUB to arrange reservations for vehicles and Fleet drivers. Please contact (814) 865-7117 for further information.\nLong-Term Vehicle Assignments (Previously Full-Time or Permanently Assigned Vehicles):\nLong-term assignments of Fleet vehicles made on the same vehicle with the same budget and fund numbers are made for a specific time period equaling 14 days or more in a one month period. To request a long-term vehicle assignment, customers must complete the Long-Term Vehicle Assignment Request, per GURU instructions. These forms must be signed by the Budget Executive and Financial Officer. Read instructions carefully and provide all information requested. Forms not properly completed will be returned for completion.\nRequests made for a time period of fifteen (15) days to one month will be charged a minimum of a one month fee. Charges are still initiated on the pick-up date indicated by the requestor even if the vehicle is not picked-up when requested.\nThe person(s) designated as Point of Contact (POC) must ensure that the end-of-month odometer readings are accurately reported to Fleet Operations by the 2nd day of the month following the reporting month. In the event that monthly odometer readings are not received by the 2nd of the month, one mile will be added to the previous monthly reading and any overages will be billed the following month.\nIf the designated person(s) is not available on any given month, an alternate must be designated. The base monthly vehicle rate includes 1,000 miles. In the event that all of the 1,000 miles are not used, they do not \u201croll-over\u201d to the next month. Failure to report monthly odometer readings may result in penalty charges and\/or loss of the use of the vehicle.\nAll personnel utilizing long-term vehicles MUST maintain a Long-Term Vehicle Usage Log. A copy of the usage log is provided to the operator at the time of vehicle pick-up. Usage logs are subject to University audit and must be available upon request. Additional copies of the Long-Term Vehicle Usage Log can be obtained by contacting Fleet Operations at fleet@psu.edu or 814-865-7571.\nFleet Vehicle Restrictions:\nTowing\nPrior approval from Fleet Operations is required if the vehicle is to be used for towing. Only certain 4WD vehicles have a towing package. Additionally, some 4WD vehicles are limited to certain \u201cclasses of trailers.\u201d\nWhen submitting the vehicle request, inform Fleet personnel of the need for a vehicle with a towing package. Please note that prior approval is needed to examine towing capacities and experience of drivers.\n\nTrailers\nThe towing of trailers and equipment by motor vehicles on University business presents liability exposure to the University and the drivers of the towing vehicles, as well as concerns for the safety of University employees and equipment. In light of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code (PA Title 75, which addresses motor vehicles, including trailers), and the insurance industry practice of insuring a trailer in tandem with the vehicle towing the trailer (known as the \u201cpower unit\u201d), all University owned, hired, or leased trailers shall be towed by University owned, hired or leased power units. The towing of University owned, hired, or leased trailers by personally-owned vehicles is not permitted.\nPower units shall be sufficiently designed and capable for the trailer and cargo, and the University\u2019s Fleet Operations Office should be contacted to help evaluate the proper power unit and trailer.\n\nAlteration of Vehicles\nAny alteration of any Fleet vehicle system is strictly prohibited, including, but not limited to, the use of electronic transformers\/transducers or any device used to plug in additional electronic equipment not authorized by Fleet Operations, roof racks, and mobile caution\/emergency lights.\nIn the event that a department requires such equipment, they may contact the Fleet Vehicle Manager who will work with them to coordinate such needs.\nThose vehicles with existing roof racks may be used for this purpose, but persons are cautioned against exceeding the weight limit of the roof. Repair of any damages caused by unauthorized alterations or modifications will result in additional charges to that department\u2019s budget\/fund.\nExterior coverings on Fleet vehicles such as graphics or wraps must be approved by the Fleet Vehicle Manager prior to application due to possible surface damage.\n\nNo text messaging or cell phone use when operating vehicles while on University business. (SY37)\nNo pets\/animals in the vehicle\nNo smoking in the vehicle\nNo alcohol consumption in the vehicle\nNo removal of seats by the customer\nNo transporting of bio-hazardous material(s)\nFleet vehicles are intended for passenger, business use only\nFleet vehicles serve passengers and are not intended for hauling items to include animals or large items to include bicycles or equipment that may cause damage to the interior of the vehicle.\nAny unauthorized use resulting in damage or necessary additional cleaning to the vehicle may result in additional charges and possibly suspension or termination of Fleet vehicle usage.\nFleet Vehicle Notifications:\nFleet Operations must be notified in the event of a vehicle breakdown or accident to determine and assess the situation in terms of safety of the customer and condition of the vehicle. Fleet Operations personnel will provide the driver with instructions appropriate to the particular circumstances in order to get the customer back on the road as quickly as possible.\nSuch information is vital for not only customer needs but also to determine the impact of that vehicle to future rentals.\nLarge Passenger Van Rental and Usage:\nLarge Passenger van usage requires that the University employee be 25 years of age or older, or possess a valid commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL), and successfully complete two (2) WEB-based training and testing modules (accessible at the Penn State Large Passenger Van Training website).\nFor safety reasons, the University has instituted the following requirements:\nA maximum of fifteen (15) passengers is authorized.\nSeat belt use is mandatory for all passengers.\nLuggage or items may not be stacked higher than the bottom edge of the windows.\nLarge Passenger vans are not authorized for towing purposes.\nNo materials may be carried on the vehicle roof.\nDamage Or Abuse Of Vehicles:\nAny damage occurring to a Fleet vehicle must be reported to Fleet Operations immediately. Do not wait until the vehicle is returned to Fleet Operations to disclose damage, due to the impact of the vehicle assignments. Long-term vehicles will be scheduled for necessary repairs.\nIf abuse or misuse of a vehicle is found to be the cause of vehicle damage, the department is held responsible for the full cost of repairs. Departments found to have persons abusing Fleet vehicles will be requested to immediately return the vehicle(s) and may be refused future assignments.\nAdditional reasons for possible termination of Fleet vehicle privileges include, but are not limited to:\nreported reckless driving habits;\nrepeated accidents caused by driver negligence;\nmisuse of the fuel card;\nlate reporting of monthly odometer readings;\nnon-payment of vehicle violations;\nnoncompliance of University policies as outlined in this regulation and elsewhere; and\nother behaviors or use of the vehicle(s) that are not in the best interest of the University.\n Zero Deductible:\nDaily Rentals- Fleet Operations offers an optional coverage that reduces the deductible to zero for a minimal fee. The zero deductible is offered on the Fleet Vehicle Reservation Form, or when picking up the vehicle by circling the \u201cYES\u201d for zero deductible on the \u201cCheck-out Confirmation\u201d Form. Fleet Operations considers the zero deductible as applicable if either the department (when completing the Fleet Vehicle Reservation Form) or the individual signing for the vehicle, upon check-out, designates \u201cyes\u201d on either form, even if the two do not match.\nLong-Term Vehicle Assignments- Departments with long-term assigned vehicles also have the option of selecting the \u201czero deductible\u201d coverage. This must be selected and approved by the Budget Executive and Financial Officer when the Long-Term Vehicle Assignment Request is submitted.\nZero deductible does not cover misuse or abuse of a vehicle. The department will be charged the full amount of damages if misuse or abuse is determined. Fleet Operations reserves the right to refuse the zero deductible option to individuals or departments whose vehicle accident record reflects numerous or repetitive accidents.\nA Fleet Driver trip is not eligible for the zero deductible option. (This includes cars dropped at airports, etc.)\nThe fee for zero deductible is available at the Fleet Operations web site.\n Fuel Credit Cards:\nAll Fleet vehicles are assigned a fuel card which is located in the visor pack. Fuel cards may only be used for fuel, oil, and\/or emergency repairs after receiving verbal authorization by Fleet Operations personnel.\nThe fuel card must accompany the vehicle when it is returned to Fleet Operations. Any vehicle returned without the credit card will not be considered \u201creturned or checked-in\u201d until the credit card is received by Fleet Operations. The department will be responsible for any additional costs involved for additional days accumulated on the original reservation.\nIf a card is \u201cLost or Stolen\u201d it must be reported immediately to Fleet Operations. Because Fleet Operations receives electronic copies of all transactions, any paper receipts may be properly disposed of by the user. The fuel card is widely accepted and can be used at all major gas stations. If for some reason, a customer must use another method of payment to fuel a Fleet vehicle, he\/she must provide Fleet Operations with the original receipt and complete the Fleet Fuel\/Repair form. University Purchasing cards are not authorized for the fuel purchases of Fleet vehicles. As an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, fuel purchases on the Fleet fuel cards are exempt from any applicable liquid fuels tax and fuel use tax. Fleet Operations will not reimburse fuel paid for with the University Purchasing card.\nFleet Operations will not reimburse fuel paid for with the University Purchasing Card.\nVehicle Maintenance:\nFleet vehicles are serviced and maintained on a regular basis.\nPersonnel with vehicles located within easy access of University Park will arrange and bring the vehicles to Fleet Operations for this service. Vehicles maintained at the Commonwealth Campuses may have the service performed at their locations with prior approval and arrangements by the Fleet Operations Vehicle Manager. Any unscheduled vehicle repairs (i.e., caused by accident), need to be coordinated and approved by Fleet Operations PRIOR to the work being conducted.\nBilling and Invoicing:\nAll billing and invoices are done electronically. Persons designated to receive weekly\/monthly billing must have their Financial Officer provide VAUX authorization via the IBIS system.\nProfessional Fleet Driver Services:\nFleet Operations provides professional, commercial-licensed drivers for University business purposes and special events coordinated through the Nittany Lion Inn, Penn Stater Conference Center Hotel, or Pasquerilla Spiritual Center. This service is available in conjunction with vehicle reservations for many vehicles such as buses, the trolleys, mini-vans, maxi-vans and Fleet cars through a Penn State budget. The contact at the venue will provide specific information regarding rental processes. All Fleet buses and trolleys are ADA accessible and include a wheelchair lift. Vehicle rentals without Fleet drivers are not authorized for special events. All Fleet driver reservations must be processed through the online reservation system.\nDriver Services trips involving extended periods may include charges for lodging, meals, tolls, parking, etc.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nSee other associated University policies, especially the following:\nBS03 - Faculty and Staff Parking Rules and Regulations\nBS18 - Procurement or Acquisition of Light-Duty Motor Vehicles (8,500 GVW or less) [Formerly Procurement of Passenger Vehicles]\nPenn State Travel Policy\nSY37 - Text Messaging and Cell Phone Use When Operating Vehicles While on University Business\nEffective Date: February 27, 2017\n\tDate Approved: February 24, 2017\n\tDate Published: February 27, 2017\nMost Recent Changes:\nFebruary 27, 2017 - Revisions have been made to the WHO MAY DRIVE ON UNIVERSITY BUSINESS and FLEET OPERATIONS VEHICLES (Long-Term Vehicle Assignments) sections, to clarify the particulars of current operations and bring policy verbiage in sync with the Penn State Travel Policy.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nNovember 2, 2016 - Addition of a SCOPE section, to clarify the parameters and restrictions applicable to all vehicles used for University business.\nDecember 2, 2014 - Revisions to the PURPOSE, WHO MAY DRIVE ON UNIVERSITY BUSINESS, TRUCK RENTAL, VEHICLE ACCIDENT REPORTING, FINES, TOLLS AND PARKING FEES and FLEET OPERATIONS VEHICLE sections to clarify current operations.\nApril 7, 2014 - Editorial changes.

However, because only 3% of electricity in Pennsylvania is currently considered renewable1, charging of electric vehicles must be offset by an equivalent renewable energy source to be considered a sustainable alternative transportation practice.\nSeveral EV stations have been established on campus by the Office of Physical Plant (OPP) for use by their department vehicles only. The stations were purchased by OPP and the electricity used by these stations is offset by renewable energy sources also established by OPP on campus.\nThe University does not distribute or sell any form of vehicle fuel for public consumption. Pennsylvania law also prohibits the direct sale of electricity by anyone other than a licensed electricity provider.\n1 U.S. Department of Energy. \"Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy in Pennsylvania.\" Energy.gov.

If an individual whose salary exceeds the cap is performing effort on an account subject to a reimbursement salary cap, the amount charged to the account for each month must be calculated to account for the cap. When an effort confirmation for a grant includes an employee who earns at a rate in excess of a reimbursement salary cap, a notation must be listed at the bottom of the effort confirmation. When confirming effort, the following must be noted on the bottom of the effort confirmation statement when the reimbursement salary cap limitation has been applied:\n\n\t_______(1)_______ spent __(2)__% of his\/her time on the grant from the period of ________ through ________ , but is only permitted to charge __(3)__% due to the cap.\n(1) Name of the individual earning in excess of the cap,\n\t(2) Actual percent effort,\n\t(3) Percent of salary charged to grant.\nAny difference between the actual percent effort and the percent effort charged must be tracked and charged to the same budget function (function code) as the agreement (Instruction, Research, or Outreach). \u00a0Amounts over the salary caps are NOT allowable costs, and therefore are not permitted as cost sharing.\nPlease note that if the effort changes by month (e.g. 20% in April and 30% in May), a separate statement is required for each time period.\nTo illustrate the application of these guidelines, the following example has been prepared:\nAssume that Dr. Sal Kapp earns $162,000 per academic year on an academic 36 week appointment. He has committed 25% of his effort to a sponsored project, but the sponsor limits the salary to no more than $191,300 per year. Dr. Kapp's annualized monthly salary is equivalent to $18,000 or $162,000 \/ 9 months. The imposed salary cap monthly salary is equivalent to $15,941.67 or $191,300 \/ 12 months. An adjustment will need to be made on the amount being paid on the sponsored project taking into consideration Dr. Kapp's 25% percent effort and the maximum allowable amount. The monthly salary costs for the project effort would be $4,500 or $18,000 * 25%, but the maximum allowable monthly salary cost would be $3,985.42 or $15,941.67 *25%. Therefore, the percent of effort that can be charged to the sponsored project would be 22.14% or $3,985.42 \/ $4,500 * 25%. The amount of salary not reimbursed by the sponsored project would be $514.58 per month or $4,500 - $3,985.42.\nAll individuals whose salary is impacted by a salary limitation shall indicate concurrence at the time of award with the following language:\n\"I understand that the sponsored project titled \"insert title\" sponsored by \"insert sponsor\" has imposed a cap on my salary reimbursement. In the event that allowable non-federal funds are unavailable or only partially available to support the portion of my salary above the imposed cap, I understand that my rate of pay will be below my annualized monthly salary. It will be my responsibility to identify the source of allowable non-federal funds, subject to Budget Administrator\/Budget Executive approval.\"\nIf Dr. Kapp receives his full salary, the $514.58 balance of his monthly salary must be charged to an account with the same function code as the sponsored project. The following statement must be added to the effort confirmation of the project:\n\"Dr. Kapp spent 25% of his time on the project during the period xx\/xx\/xxxx through xx\/xx\/xxxx but is only permitted to charge 22.14% due to the cap.\"\nPlease note that the NIH salary cap is updated annually effective January 1st and should be taken into consideration for effort certification notations. Current NIH Rate caps listing. Other agencies may also have salary caps, which could be different than those referenced for NIH, so verify the caps based on agency guidelines and regulations.\u00a0 There is no centralized source summarizing all salary caps in effect.\nACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS:\nThe amount of salary over the cap must be accounted for within Pay and Effort and should be charged to a general fund account to assure that it is appropriately included in the cost base for F&A purposes.\u00a0 Units should set up a unique cost center to track the amount over a salary cap so these amounts can be easily identified.\u00a0 The excess may also be charged to another source of funding \u2013 MGR, gift or endowment \u2013 but needs to be clearly traceable to confirm where the costs have been charged.\nHowever, the amounts over the salary cap CANNOT be used as cost sharing.\u00a0 See Cost Sharing FAQ for additional detail.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies should also be referenced, especially the following:\nRA21-Development of Proposal Budget (Formerly RA03)\nRA64 - Personnel Costs\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\n\u00a0\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new guideline (incorporating parts of RA08) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"Policy RA64 provides detail on appropriate management of personnel costs to comply with the Uniform Guidance, specifically Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.430\u00a0 Compensation \u2013 personal services.\u00a0 This guideline provides more detail on salary cap documentation requirements."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad22","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD22\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents:\nPurpose\nDefinitions\nScope\nPolicy\nI.

A Covered Component must comply with HIPAA.\nCovered Transaction\u2013 The transmission of information between two parties to carry out financial or administrative activities related to health care (e.g. health claims, payment, coordination of benefits, enrollment or disenrollment, eligibility for a health plan, and other transactions that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may prescribe by regulation 45 CFR \u00a7 160.103).\nHybrid Entity-An organization that performs both HIPAA-covered and non-covered functions as part of its business.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \u2013 Agency responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, used by federal agencies in providing adequate information security for the protection of agency operations and assets.\nProtected Health Information (PHI) - Individually identifiable health information that is collected from an individual, created or received by a health care provider, health plan, health care clearinghouse, or other employee of one of the Covered Components of the University.\u00a0 This PHI is confidential and must be treated as protected under HIPAA. Protected Health Information relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.\nSCOPE:\nThis policy is applicable to the University\u2019s academic and administrative units, except the College of Medicine and Hershey Medical Center, and applies to all units determined to be Covered Components under HIPAA.\nPOLICY:\nI. Designation of Covered Components\nThe University is considered a Hybrid Entity under HIPAA as an organization whose activities include both HIPAA-covered and non-covered functions. As such, the University has identified specific units to be Covered Components that are required to meet specific standards under HIPAA as participants in the delivery of health care, paying for health care, and providing operational support for health care services. In addition, units providing services and support functions to those Covered Components involved in treatment, payment, and health care operations must meet specific requirements under HIPAA. A summary of the HIPAA privacy regulations are located at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164.\nA list of the University\u2019s identified Covered Components can be obtained, per request, from the HIPAA Compliance Team at hipaa@psu.edu.\nII. Requirements for Covered Components\nCovered Components of the University and their individual employees, students and volunteers must comply with the following privacy and security practices in the use, storage and disclosure of protected health information as required by HIPAA.\n\nClinical Treatment\nPHI obtained by those involved in providing health care will be recorded in a medical record and used to determine the course of treatment. Other members of the health care team may use this record to help in treatment and in order to coordinate the different services individuals might need, such as prescriptions, lab work, and x-rays. If an individual is referred to another clinician or hospital, PHI regarding their treatment at the University may be shared with these health care providers without the individual\u2019s authorization, with the exception of mental health records.\n\n\nBilling\nHealth care personnel in a Covered Component may use PHI to create a bill to be sent to an individual patient or a third-party payor like an insurance company without the individual\u2019s authorization, unless the individual specifically opts out of submitting the bill to insurance and self-pays for the health care services. The information on or accompanying the bill may include PHI such as an individual's diagnosis, procedures, and supplies used.\n\n\nStandard Electronic Transactions\nCovered Components routinely billing for their services, performing transactions covered under HIPAA, and performing those transactions electronically must comply with the standard transaction code sets of HIPAA implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\nQuality Improvement Activities\nMembers of the clinical staff of a Covered Component, the risk or quality improvement manager, or members of the quality improvement team may use PHI without the individual\u2019s authorization to conduct quality assessment and improvement activities and case management and care coordination efforts. Covered Components may use PHI to review treatment and services and to evaluate the performance of staff involved in providing care to patients.\n\n\nMinimum Necessary Use or Disclosure\nStaff employed within the Covered Components shall be granted access only to the minimum amount of PHI required to perform their job functions, required by 45 164.502(b), 162.514 (d). Moreover, for any PHI disclosure, the Covered Component must develop standard criteria to limit the PHI disclosed to the amount reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure.\n\n\nSecurity of Electronic PHI (ePHI)\nAll Covered Components and members of their workforce (employees, students, and volunteers) must take appropriate and reasonable measures, based on the NIST administrative, technical and physical safeguards, to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of PHI. Specifically, Covered Components must assess the needs for such safeguards, select and implement protections appropriate for the Covered Component, and collaborate with the University\u2019s HIPAA Security Officer, in the process of assessing and implementing such safeguards. These safeguards must protect PHI from any intentional or unintentional use or disclosure that is a violation of the standards contained in this policy. A summary of The Security Rule is located at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and C of Part 164.\n\t\tIn no case will PHI be transmitted electronically, unencrypted or reside on any system without being encrypted at rest, unless appropriately discussed with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officers.\u00a0 Additional information pertaining to the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) can be referenced in Policy AD53.\n\nDevelop Access Control of PHI\nAll Covered Components must develop policies that identify the types of persons within their unit that need access to PHI and the specific PHI to which they need access.\n\n\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nEach Covered Component that has a direct treatment relationship with an individual must provide a Notice of Privacy Practices (the \"Notice\") to such individual upon the first delivery of services following the effective date of this policy. If the first delivery of services is an emergency situation, the Notice may be provided as soon as reasonably practical. The Covered Component must make a good faith effort to obtain a written acknowledgment from the individual that a Notice was provided, and if not obtained, the good faith efforts to obtain the individual's acknowledgment and why it was not obtained.The Notice must be readily available at all practice sites of Covered Components for distribution upon request, and must be posted for public view at an easily visible location.\n\n\nUse of Support Services from Outside Vendors\nA Covered Component may need to contract or otherwise arrange for services of a business, organization, or an individual who is not employed by the University (a \"vendor\") in order to perform tasks or services in support of the operations of the Covered Component. If the vendor will have access to PHI in the course of performing such services, a Business Associate Agreement between the University and the vendor must be in place prior to commencement ofwork. The University Purchasing Office may be responsible for the preparation and processing of Business Associate Agreements, if appropriate, and in coordination with the HIPAA Privacy Officer, HIPAA Security Officer, Risk Management, and the Office of General Counsel (OGC).\n\n\nAccess to PHI by Other University Units and Employees\nA Covered Component may not disclose PHI, or allow the opportunity for access to PHI, to any University employee who is not assigned to work in a Covered Component as designated in Part I of this policy, unless (a) the individual has signed a HIPAA-Compliant Authorization Form for such release; (b) suchdisclosure or access is necessary for the treatment of patients, for obtaining payment for services, or for the operation of the Covered Component; (c) such disclosure or access has been approved for research in accordance with Policy RP07; (d) such disclosure or access is authorized in advance by the HIPAA Privacy Officer; or (e) such disclosure, or access is authorized by the Office of General Counsel, pursuant to section III.(B). and III.(I)., below.\n\n\nDisposal of Paper and Electronic Records and Media Containing PHI\nCovered Components must establish safeguards for proper, HIPAA-Complaint disposal of paper and electronic records and media containing PHI. If Covered Components do not shred paper products internally in a secure manner (cross-cut shredding) and outside services are required, the Covered Component must use the University approved document destruction service. If alternative methods are used, they must be approved by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officers. The methods of disposal of electronic records and media must meet standards established by the University's Office of Information Security.Personal computers and servers containing PHI may only be disposed of in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of Information Security, and in accordance with Policy AD35.\n\n\nResearch\nCovered Components cannot use or disclose PHI for purposes of research, except as approved by the Office of Research Protections (See Policy\u00a0RP07). This restriction applies to research proposed by University faculty, staff and students, as well as to research proposed by any other person or organization.\n\nIII. Disclosure of PHI Outside of Covered Components\n\nAuthorization\nCovered Components may disclose an individual's PHI in accordance with the terms of a written and signed HIPAA-Compliant Authorization Form furnished by that individual.\n\n\nAs Required by Law\nCovered Components may disclose PHI about individuals without their authorization when required to do so by federal, state or local law. Questions or concerns regarding disclosures pursuant to this section should be directed to the University\u2019s Office of General Counsel.\n\n\nTo Avert A Serious Threat to Health and Safety\nCovered Components may use and disclose PHI about individuals without their authorization when necessary to prevent a serious threat to the individual's health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure to prevent a serious threat to health and safety may only be to someone able to help prevent that threat.\n\n\nOutside Individuals Involved in a Patient's Care\nIn life threatening\/extreme emergency situations, Covered Components may use or disclose PHI without the individual's authorization to notify, or assist in notifying a family member, personal representative, or another person responsible for the care of another individual, regarding the location and general condition of the individual. Covered Components may release PHI about individuals to a friend or family member who is involved in the health care of an individual. In addition,Covered Components may disclose PHI about the individual to an organization assisting in a disaster relief effort so that the individual's family can be notified about their condition, status and location.\n\n\nPublic Health Risks\nCovered Components may disclose PHI without the individual\u2019s authorization to certain public health authorities and others responsible for ensuring public health and safety who are legally authorized to receive such reports for certain public health activities.These activities generally include the following:\nto prevent or control disease, injury or disability;\nto report births and deaths;\nto report child abuse or neglect;\nto report reactions to medications or problems with products;\nto notify people of recalls of products they may be using;\nto notify a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting or spreading a disease or condition; and\nto notify the appropriate government authority if an individual has been the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. This disclosure may occur only if the individual agrees or when the Covered Component is required or authorized by law.\n\n\nHealth Oversight Activities\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components without the individual\u2019s authorization to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities include,for example, audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system,government programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.\n\n\nMilitary and Veterans\nPHI about members of the United States armed forces or foreign military personnel as requested by military command authorities to assure the proper execution of the military mission, may be disclosed by Covered Components without the individual\u2019s authorization. This disclosure may occur only if the appropriate military authority has published a notice in the Federal Register with the following information:\nappropriate military command authorities or the appropriate foreign military authority, and;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\npurposes for which the protected PHI may be issued or disclosed.\n\n\nWorkers' Compensation\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components without the individual\u2019s authorization to the extent authorized by and to the extent necessary to comply with laws relating to workers' compensation or other similar programs established by law.\n\n\nLawsuits and Disputes\nAt the direction of the Office of General Counsel, PHI may be disclosed by Covered Components in connection with a lawsuit or dispute in response to a court or administrative order. Covered Components may also disclose medical information in response to a subpoena,discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved in the dispute if such subpoena provides \u201csatisfactory assurances\u201d, usually in the form of a Notice of Intent, that ensures the individual whose PHI is sought has been notified of the subpoena and has had appropriate time to quash the subpoena and\/or in response to a HIPAA compliant authorization. A Covered Component may use and disclose PHI without the individual\u2019s authorization in defending or asserting a lawsuit involving an individual's treatment by that Covered Component. Questions or concerns regarding disclosures pursuant to this section should be directed to the University\u2019s Office of General Counsel.\n\n\nLaw Enforcement\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components without the individual\u2019s authorization if asked to do so by a law enforcement official:\nat the direction of the Office of General Counsel in response to a court order, subpoena (with \u201csatisfactory assurances\u201d), grand jury subpoena (no satisfactory assurances required), search warrant or summons issued by a judge;\nto identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person by providing only certain limited disclosures of PHI;\nabout the victim of a crime if, under certain limited circumstances, we are unable to obtain the person's agreement;\nto report child abuse to ChildLine;\nwhen required by state law (e.g. incidents of gunshot or stab wounds);\nto report PHI that the Covered Component in good faith believes to be evidence of a crime that occurred on the Covered Component\u2019s premises; and\nas necessary to alert law enforcement about criminal activity, specifically, the commission and nature of the crime, the location of the crime or any victims and the identity, description and location of the perpetrator the crime.\n\n\nNational Security and Intelligence Activities\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components to authorized federal officials without the individual consent for intelligence, counterintelligence, and other national security activities authorized by law.\n\n\nProtective Services of the President of the United States and Others\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components to authorized federal officials without the individual\u2019s consent so they may provide protection to the President of the United States,other authorized persons or foreign heads of state or conduct special investigations.\n\n\nInmates\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components without the individual\u2019s consent about inmates of a correctional institution or under the custody of a law enforcement official to the correctional institution or law enforcement official. This information maybe disclosed if it is necessary for the institution to provide the inmate with health care; to protect the inmate's health and safety or the health and safety of others; or for the safety and security of the correctional institutions.\n\n\nCoroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors\nPHI may be disclosed by Covered Components to a coroner or medical examiner. This may be necessary to identify a deceased person or to determine the cause of death. In addition, Covered Components may disclose PHI to funeral directors as necessary to carry out their duties with respect to the deceased.\n\n\nAccounting for Disclosures\nAll Covered Components must have systems in place for the accounting of disclosures of PHI. Specifically, Covered Components must be able to list all disclosures the Covered Component has made of the individual\u2019s PHI that does not include disclosures to the individual, disclosures for treatment, payment or operations purposes, those disclosures previously authorized by the individual, national security or intelligence purposes or to correctional institutions. Such disclosures must follow the retention schedule in University Policy AD35, University Archives and Record Management.\n\nIV. Individual Rights to Be Assured by Covered Components\nIndividuals have the following rights regarding PHI that Covered Components maintain about them:\n\nRight to Inspect and Copy\nIndividuals have the right to inspect and copy PHI that may be used to make decisions about their own care. This includes medical and billing records, but does not include psychotherapy notes. To inspect and copy PHI,individuals must submit their request in writing to the Covered Component creating or using that PHI. If individuals request a copy of the PHI, the Covered Component may charge a fee for the costs of copying, mailing or other supplies associated with the request. The Covered Component may deny a request to inspect and copy in certain very limited circumstances. If an individual is denied access to PHI, they may request that the denial be reviewed. Another licensed health care professional chosen by the University will review the request and the denial. The person conducting the review will not be the person who denied the original request.\n\n\nRight to Amend\nIf an individual maintains that PHI the Covered Component has about them is incorrect or incomplete, they may ask the Covered Component to amend the information. The individual has the right to request an amendment for as long as the information is kept by or for the Covered Component.\nTo request an amendment, a request must be made in writing and submitted to the Covered Component responsible for the maintenance of that information. In addition, the individual must provide a detailed reason that supports the request.\nA Covered Component may deny the request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request. In addition, Covered Components may deny the request if the individual asks to amend information that:\nwas not created by the Covered Component;\nis not part of the PHI kept by or for the Covered Component;\nis not part of the information which an individual would be permitted to inspect and copy; or\nis accurate and complete in the opinion of the health care professional who documented it.\n\n\nRight to an Accounting of Disclosures\nIndividuals have the right to request an accounting of disclosures of their PHI that occurred within the last six (6) years, as referenced in Section III, Subpart O, above.\nTo request an accounting of disclosures, the individual must submit a request in writing to the Covered Component responsible for that PHI. The request must state a time period, which may not be longer than six (6) years from the date of the request. The request should indicate in what form the individual wants the list (e.g., on paper,electronically). Covered Components may charge individuals for the cost of providing the list. Covered Components must notify individuals of the cost involved and individuals may choose to withdraw or modify their request at that time before any costs are incurred.\n\n\nRight to Request Restrictions\nIndividuals have the right to request a restriction or limitation on the PHI used by Covered Components or disclosed about the individual for treatment, payment or health care operations. Covered Components are not required to agree to the individual's request. However, Covered Components may not disclose an individual\u2019s PHI to their health insurer if the individual pays out of pocket, in full, for their care and specifically requests this restriction.\nRestrictions must be requested in writing to the Covered Components responsible for the use and disclosure of that PHI. In the request, the individual must tell the Covered Component (1) what information they want to limit; (2) whether they want to limit use, disclosure or both; and (3) to whom they want the limits to apply, for example, disclosure to a spouse, parent or health insurer.\n\n\nRight to Request Confidential Communications\nIndividuals have the right to request that University personnel communicate with them about health care matters in a certain way or at a certain location. For example, the individual can request that they only be contacted at work. To request confidential communications, individuals must make their request in writing to the Covered Component responsible for this communication.University personnel may not ask the individual the reason for the request. The responsible Covered Component shall accommodate all reasonable requests so long as that request does not violate the other protections specified in this policy or other state or federal law. Any request must specify how or where the individual wishes to be contacted.\n\n\nRight to a Paper Copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices\nThe individual has the right to a paper copy of the Notice. Individuals may ask Covered Components to give them a copy of the Notice at any time. Even if an individual has agreed to receive the Notice electronically, they are still entitled to a paper copy of the Notice.\n\n\nRight to Receive Notice of a Breach\n\t\tPursuant to the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, an individual has a right to receive a written notice if their unsecured PHI has been breached while in the possession, custody or control of a Covered Component or a vendor working with the Covered Component. If you suspect a breach of unsecured PHI has occurred, immediately report this to hipaa@psu.edu or security@psu.edu.\nV. Administration and Compliance\nA. Privacy Officer Designation .\nThe University shall designate a HIPAA Privacy Officer responsible for coordinating compliance with specific standards of the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations.\nB. Security Officer Designation\nThe University shall designate a HIPAA Security Officer responsible for coordinating compliance with specific standards of the HIPAA Security Rule regulations, in regards to the protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).\nSecurity standards under HIPAA, when issued, will be in coordination with the NIST safeguards, along with Penn State\u2019s Computer Network Security Policies\u00a0AD20\u00a0and\u00a0AD23, and Guideline\u00a0ADG02.\nC. Health Care Component HIPAA Compliance\nEach Covered Component must assign a staff member, within their area, the responsibility of HIPAA compliance and regulatory implementation to include both the Privacy and Security Rules.\nBusiness Associate Agreements\nThe\u00a0HIPAA Privacy and Security Officers will work with the University Purchasing Office, Risk Management, and the Office of General Counsel, when appropriate, to review and approve all Business Associated Agreements (BAA).\u00a0The unit and\/or Covered Component to which the contract applies to, is responsible for retaining an executed copy of the BAA and providing a copy to the HIPAA Compliance Team at\u00a0hipaa@psu.edu.\nD. Complaints Under HIPAA\nThe University's HIPAA Privacy Officer will be responsible for the implementation and administration of an institutionally based complaint process in compliance with HIPAA. Patients may complain directly to the University's Privacy Office or to the\u00a0Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0if they believe their privacy rights have been violated. To contact the University's Privacy Office, complaints may be directed to:\nHIPAA Privacy Officer\n\tPrivacy Office\n\t025 Technology Support Building\n\t300 Science Park Road\n\tState College, PA 16803\n\tPhone 814-863-5915\n\tFAX 814-863-2174\nVI. Individual Rights and Responsibilities\nA. Training Requirements\nEmployees, students, and volunteers within a Covered Component of the University must receive training to assure their understanding of HIPAA privacy policies and procedures. This training must be appropriate for the members of the workforce to carry out their function within their employment, educational or volunteering area. Each new member of the Covered Components' workforce must also be trained within a reasonable period of time after the new staff member begins their employment or activity with the University. In addition, all employees of the Covered Components must receive training updates when there is a substantial change in the privacy policies that would affect the ability to do their job.\nAt the conclusion of all training sessions, participants shall sign and date a statement indicating their understanding and agreeing to comply with the privacy policies and procedures \u00a0 \u00a0 of the University and other requirements as defined in the training session.

OTM will be primarily responsible for assessing the value and benefits of accepting donations of intellectual property and will recommend a course of action regarding proffered intellectual property to the Assistant Vice President for Research. These recommendations will be based on the criteria outlined below.\nThe donor will obtain a valuation of the intellectual property available for donation (hereinafter \"IP\") by an independent, impartial third party and will share the complete valuation analysis with Penn State including the basis on which the valuation was generated.\nCurrent status of IP will be clearly identified and IP will be free of all encumbrances, claims and\/or interferences.\nThe donor shall clearly identify the IP with respect to patent applications, issued patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know how, technical information and\/or other.\nDonor shall provide Penn State with an accurate current status of pending patent applications and issued patents.\nDonor shall provide Penn State with its best estimate of future expenses to prosecute pending patent applications and to maintain issued patents.\nThe donor shall pay all expenses associated with the prosecution of pending patent applications and the maintenance of issued patents prior to transfer of IP to Penn State.\nThe donor shall pay all expenses associated with the prosecution of pending patent applications and the maintenance of issued patents after transfer of IP to Penn State for a period of two years to minimize the immediate negative financial impact of accepting the donation .\nDonor shall inform Penn State regarding any ongoing or anticipated patent enforcement and\/or patent infringement issues.\\\nDonor shall warrant that it solely owns the IP and has the right to transfer ownership.\nIP shall not be subject to any pending litigation\nAny anticipated IP litigation shall be identified.\n\nA Penn State faculty member with relevant expertise, an active research program related to the IP and an interest in actively participating in continued research, development and transfer of the IP should be identified.\nIP should complement or supplement an active Penn State research program.\nResources (research funding, facilities, personnel, etc.) should be available to continue development of the IP and\/or acceptance of the IP should provide leverage to obtain the required resources.\nDonor understands that IP donations are most effective when accompanied by other resources (financial, equipment, other) to promote continued research, development, transfer and commercialization and donor will consider providing such additional resources.\nAlong with the IP donation, the donor agrees to bestow a gift in the amount of at least 10% of the Donor's IRS tax deduction associated with the IP donation. Penn State agrees to use the gift to support research, development, transfer and commercialization of the donated IP.\n\nIP should have sufficient patent life remaining to allow continued research, development, transfer and commercialization.\nIP should have a minimum of seven (7) years of patent life remaining from the date of transfer to Penn State.\nIP with less than seven (7) years of patent life remaining will be considered only under special circumstances.\n\nDonor shall share all information for any known or anticipated approvals (such as FDA, USDA, EPA, NIH and\/or other) that may be required prior to commercialization of IP.\nDonor will provide current status of approvals and a best estimate of any expenses associated with receiving approvals.\nDonor will provide best estimate of probability of receiving approvals and resources required to receive approvals.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nIP06\u00a0- Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurial Activity (Faculty Research)\nEffective Date: January 7, 2013\n\tDate Approved: September 14, 2012\n\tDate Published: January 7, 2013 (Editorial changes- November 19, 2015)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 19, 2015 - Editorial changes.

Ticket accountability reporting is required for all events in all University venues. In addition, ticket accountability reports for events held at Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center, and Pegula Ice Arena (hockey) must be submitted to the University\u2019s Corporate Controller\u2019s Office. Tickets or passes for free events do not fall under this policy, even if used for University purposes.\nDEFINITIONS:\nBudget Executive: the leader of an administrative unit at the University \u2013 college, campus, or administrative support unit. Titles include President, Provost, Vice President, Vice Provost, Director of Athletics, Dean, and Chancellor.\nComplimentary Tickets: tickets or passes which are provided to University units or employees at no cost, even though the ticket or pass may have a value. Generally, these are controlled by the venue conducting the event, and in certain cases, may be part of the agreement with an outside contracted artist or sponsor.\nProspective Student Athlete: as defined by NCAA Bylaw 13 on recruitment, a student who, whether or not the student participates in athletics, has started classes for the ninth grade. In addition, a student who has not started classes for the ninth grade becomes a prospective student-athlete if the institution provides such an individual (or the individual's relatives or friends) any financial assistance or other benefits that the institution does not provide to prospective students generally. An individual remains a prospective student-athlete until the earliest of the following occurs:\nThe individual officially registers and enrolls in a minimum full-time program of studies and attends classes in any term of a four-year collegiate institution's regular academic year (excluding summer); or\nThe individual participates in a regular squad practice or competition at a four-year collegiate institution that occurs before the beginning of any term; or\nThe individual officially registers and enrolls and attends classes during the summer prior to initial enrollment.\nPurchased Tickets: tickets or passes purchased with unit or central University funds (generally unrestricted gift funds).\nTicket Steward: person designated by the Budget Executive to oversee the set of tickets or passes for a venue or unit in compliance with this Policy.\nUniversity Student Athlete: an enrolled student who is a member of any varsity athletic team at any location of the University.\nUniversity Ticket Accountability Report: a report which must be completed by the Ticket Steward to account for all tickets purchased or distributed by the unit.\nPOLICY:\nPurchasing Tickets: The purchase of tickets to events at University venues with University funds requires approval through the Corporate Controller\u2019s Office.\nGeneral funds cannot be used to purchase tickets for events unless provided for as an exception in another policy. Units purchasing tickets must have a valid and documented business reason, and must monitor and adjust the number of tickets purchased if not used. See Appendix A for more information on the required ticket purchasing processes and approvals.\nUniversity units using Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets, must demonstrate good stewardship in the use and management of these tickets. If a ticket for an event is used, the unit must provide information on who used the ticket and for what purpose. These tickets are being provided to support the mission and goals of the University and should be used with those goals in mind. Therefore, accountability reports will be required for all tickets whether Complimentary or Purchased to ensure appropriate use in support of the mission of the University.\nVenue Requirements: For events where Complimentary Tickets are provided to certain constituencies by the venue, the unit responsible for the venue or event must maintain detailed listings of all Complimentary Tickets, including the unit to whom the tickets were provided and the Ticket Steward. If a block of tickets is given to an outside third party for use, the unit is responsible for accounting for the name of the third party, the number of tickets, and compliance with University Policy AD86. If possible, Complimentary Tickets should be marked as such with notation that \"these tickets may not be sold\".\nUnit Requirements: Units using either Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets for events must maintain complete and accurate records pertaining to each ticket for each event. All tickets, whether complimentary or purchased, should have an assigned Ticket Steward. The Ticket Steward is responsible for (1) assuring that the tickets are used for the authorized purpose, (2) documenting those receiving tickets, their relationship to the University, and the business purpose, (3) compliance with NCAA and Governmental Affairs regulations and (4) appropriate reporting to Payroll for taxability of tickets received by employees as outlined in this policy. The appropriate University Ticket Accountability Report must be prepared by the Ticket Steward for all events where University Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets are used. For events held at Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center, and Pegula Ice Arena (hockey), these reports must be submitted to the Corporate Controller\u2019s Office. All other ticket accountability reports must be retained by the unit.\nIf tickets purchased by a unit are later resold, this must be reported in the University Ticket Accountability Report. The tickets would be listed as resold in the report, including the name of the person purchasing the ticket as well as a reference to the Report of Cash Receipts (ROCR) document number where the funds were deposited to a University account. Tickets may only be resold at face value.\nNOTE: Complimentary Tickets cannot be sold but may be returned to the Box Office for the venue. Complimentary Tickets which are not used must be listed as unused or as returned to the appropriate box office prior to the event to be sold, if appropriate.\nTickets which provide seating in restricted areas (e.g., boxes) may not be transferred to third parties by the original recipient. If the tickets cannot be used by the original recipient, they must be returned to the Ticket Steward who will determine an appropriate recipient for the tickets.\nCOMPLIANCE:\nUse of Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets must comply with all University policies and procedures, including University Policy AD86 (Accepting Gifts and Entertainment) and AD39 (Minors Involved in University-Sponsored Programs or Programs Held at the University and\/or Housed in University Facilities), as well as NCAA regulations regarding appropriate use and applicable state and federal laws.\nIt is the responsibility of the Ticket Steward to assure that those using the tickets are aware of all applicable policies and regulations. A member of the University Intercollegiate Athletics Compliance Office should be contacted if there are any questions regarding a particular guest or group that might be using restricted access tickets at Intercollegiate Athletics events. The Office of Ethics and Compliance may also be consulted.\nA. NCAA:\nTickets for special seating or standing-room-only access to University controlled areas for Intercollegiate Athletics events should not be made available to any Prospective Student Athletes or any current University Student Athlete.\nA limited exception permits Prospective Student-Athletes to access areas designated as \"special seating\" if all of the following conditions are met (also referred to as \"Sons and Daughters\" - SD):\nThe prospective student-athlete is not being recruited by Penn State in any sport;\nThe prospective student-athlete is the son, daughter, step-son, step-daughter, or legal dependent of parents who were invited by PSU and accompanying them to the suite;\nThe invitation to the suite was initiated strictly based on the parents relationship with PSU rather than the child\u2019s athletics participation or status;\nNo other prospect-aged individuals (such as other relatives, friends, etc.) are accompanying the PSU guests; and\nParents with a prospective student-athlete as a guest receive the same treatment as similarly situated guests without prospective student-athletes.\nExamples of special seating include University-controlled suites and press boxes, but can also include any location that is not accessible to the general public from which the game, meet or match can be viewed (e.g., the outside deck at Beaver Stadium).\nThese restrictions apply throughout the game and include half-time.\nB. STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS:\nAll tickets provided on a complimentary basis to state and federal officials and\/or employees, must be identified and Government and Community Relations notified to ensure compliance with the University's state and federal lobbying disclosure requirements. This would apply to tickets purchased by University units where the tickets will be complimentary to the guest being invited.\nDONATION OF COMPLIMENTARY OR PURCHASED TICKETS:\nVenues or units receiving either Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets may choose to donate tickets to an outside organization as part of community goodwill. Such donations are permitted for general admission tickets and tickets located in suites and boxes at the Bryce Jordan Center for non-athletics events, but are prohibited for tickets in boxes, suites or other restricted areas (press box) for intercollegiate athletic events, because these tickets are subject to stricter NCAA compliance standards than general admission tickets. The donation must be clearly indicated in the University Ticket Accountability Report, with the organization name, address, purpose and primary contact person listed.\nUSE OF TICKETS BY UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES:\nUniversity employees may receive Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets to events only under one of the following circumstances:\nBusiness Purpose. Employee is expected to be engaged during the event in meeting a business purpose for the University, either directly performing their job (e.g., event management, maintenance, food service, safety\/security) or in representing the University to outside constituents including alumni, donors, recruits, officials, promoters and\/or legislators. In the latter situation, spouses\/partners\/guests may also receive tickets if the expectation is the spouse\/partner\/guest will also be part of representing the University to outside constituents.\nTaxability: tickets received under this provision are not taxable to the employee.\n\nEmployment Agreement and over $100. Employee receives season tickets for personal use at no cost to the employee, as part of a contract, employment agreement, or at the discretion of the budget executive, and the value of all tickets received in a calendar year total over $100. The Venue or Ticket Steward is responsible for reporting the name of the employee, PSU ID, and total value of tickets received in a calendar year to Payroll. This should also be noted on the Ticket Steward form.\nTaxability: the value of the tickets received must be reported as a taxable benefit to the employee.\n\nReward or Recognition. Employee regularly receives tickets to events at University venues at no cost as part of a reward or recognition program or at the discretion of the budget executive.\nThe Venue or Ticket Steward providing the tickets to the employee is responsible for reporting the name of the employee, PSU ID, and total value of tickets received in a calendar year to Payroll. In addition, the executive of the unit accountable for the tickets must approve the distribution of tickets provided as part of a reward and recognition program. Those with direct supervisory responsibilities should not be determining and approving the distribution of tickets provided for general morale purposes or to fill unused seats.\nTaxability: the receipt of tickets become a taxable benefit to the employee if employee receives:\nTickets to at least four events of the same sport or entertainment venue AND the value of all tickets received in a calendar year total over $100; OR\nSeven or more tickets to a single event and the total ticket value exceeds $100\nNote: the value of the tickets received must be reported as a taxable benefit to the employee. Complimentary tickets which have no price or face value must be valued at the price of comparable tickets for the event.\n\nUnused Purchased Tickets. Employee purchases unused general seating purchased tickets at face value with no limitations, if the tickets cannot be utilized for the planned business purpose. In these situations, the tickets must be reported as sold at face value on the University Ticket Accountability Report, with the name of the person purchasing the ticket and notation of the ROCR document number where the funds were deposited to the appropriate University account.\nTaxability: tickets received under this provision are not taxable to the employee.\n\nAll of the above situations must be reported on the ticket accountability report for the event, clearly listing who received tickets.\nACCOUNTABILITY REPORTS:\nAll units receiving either Complimentary Tickets or Purchased Tickets must complete the appropriate University Ticket Accountability Report detailing the use of all tickets. The following are the requirements for reporting: Report must be completed in FULL by or on behalf of the ticket steward, assuring that all entries are legible using the appropriate report:\nSingle Event report:\nUse when either only single event was attended during season, or for non-Athletic events.\nMay also be used for venues with larger volume of tickets to report on an individual game during the season.\n\nSeason Ticket report:\nFor reporting on use of tickets for the entire season in one report. Generally preferred for use by units who have only a few tickets per game to report.\n\nApproval Cover Sheet:\nMust be completed prior to submission. Requires the signature of the Ticket Steward with approval\/signature of the Budget Executive.\n\nReports and cover sheet must be submitted to the Financial Officer, who is responsible for assuring reports are completed in full, that all areas required have submitted.\nUniversity Ticket Accountability Reports for events held at Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center, and Pegula Ice Arena (hockey) MUST be submitted to the Corporate Controller\u2019s Office, based on the due dates below.\nDue Dates:\nFootball Tickets: January 31st\nMen\u2019s and Women\u2019s Basketball: April 30th\nIce Hockey: April 30th\nBryce Jordan Center Non-Athletic Events: 30 days after the event\nRecord Retention: These reports must be retained for 3 years by the unit and\/or the Corporate Controller, unless other compliance guidelines require a longer retention period by the unit. Unused tickets, Complimentary or Purchased, for an event must be noted in the University Ticket Accountability Report. The unused tickets must be retained for 3 years with the final report filed either in the unit or in the Office of the Corporate Controller. If unused tickets were returned to the appropriate ticket office or sold, this must be indicated. The University Ticket Accountability Report must be reconciled to account for all used and unused tickets.\nEXCEPTIONS:\nExceptions to this policy may be granted by the Senior Vice President for Finance & Business or the Provost, or the President in the case where the exception is requested by the Senior Vice President for Finance & Business. Exceptions may only be granted if consistent with NCAA rules, tax requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements. No exception may be granted for a student athlete or prospective student athlete without the express permission of the Associate Athletic Director for Compliance or the University's Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nAD39 - Minors Involved in University-Sponsored Programs or Programs Held at the University and\/or Housed in University Facilities\nAD86 - Acceptance of Gifts and Entertainment\nFN10 - Other Business Expenses and Activities\nProcedure IA2002  - Football Ticket- Internal Purchase and Distribution\nProcedure IA2011 - Ticket Sales- Non-Football, Individual Event\nMost recent changes:\nNovember 7, 2016 - Changes made throughout the entire policy, clarifying the rules regarding ticket accountability and taxability of complimentary tickets.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nNovember 5, 2015 - Major changes to the policy, per June 2014 Internal Audit review.\n\u00a0\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nNovember 7, 2016>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nNovember 9, 2016>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nNovember 7, 2016>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The purpose of this policy is to provide consistency across the University as to how tickets for events in University venues are purchased, distributed and reported when used by the University, to provide greater assurance that only authorized individuals are gaining access to suites and boxes, and to comply with federal tax laws, NCAA regulations, and other regulatory requirements."},{"university":"psu","name":"hr97","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayoff Provisions for Staff Employees | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesLayoff Provisions for Staff Employees \n\n\n\nHuman Resources Policies\n\nHR97\nLayoff Provisions for Staff Employees\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Human Resources>\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: May 1, 2011\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: May 1, 2011\nContents:\nPurpose\nOverview\nDecision Criteria\nNotice of Layoff\nLayoff Provisions\nEmployment Resources\nShort-Term Closedown Provisions\nCross References\n\n\nOVERVIEW:\nA layoff of an employee can occur because of a lack of either work or funds, a reduction of the operating staff of the University, or an emergency that curtails normal operations, all of which shall be determined by the University in its sole discretion.\nA department faced with the need to reduce staff must contact their Human Resources Representative and the Employee Relations Division before any actions are taken or discussions are held with employees. Consultation with the Affirmative Action Office and the Office of General Counsel will be sought as appropriate.\nIt is presumed that individuals who receive layoff notices are valuable contributing members of the University community whose employment cannot be continued due to the above listed conditions.\nThe position formerly held by a laid off employee must remain vacant for at least one year following the layoff, except in unusual situations where funding is unexpectedly restored and with the prior approval of the Vice President for Human Resources or a designee.\nDECISION CRITERIA:\nThe decision to lay off an employee is made by the work unit's dean or administrative officer with the prior approval of the central Office of Human Resources. The following criteria shall be considered when identifying an employee for layoff: ability to perform the work needed, prior documented performance, and length of University employment.\nLength of University employment is measured in months of continuous employment in a Standing or Fixed-Term I appointment from the date of last hire and includes leaves of absence. Employment ceases to be measured when an employee quits, resigns, or is dismissed.\nA new employee is not granted credit for length of University employment during his or her probationary period. However, after the completion of his or her probation, credit will date from the first day of employment in a Standing or Fixed-Term I position. As a general principle, probationary employees will be laid off prior to employees that have completed their probationary periods.\nLayoffs shall be made within job groups in a work unit. (See \"Definition of Work Unit\" in HR34, Employment Conditions for Staff Employees.) A job group is defined as those jobs in a work unit with the same job title and level. It may also include jobs in the work unit in the same job title at lower levels and\/or different job titles but which are in the same or lower salary band. This latter type of job group is established by a dean or administrative officer at his\/her discretion.\nFixed-Term I Appointments:\nAn employee on a Fixed-Term I appointment whose employment terminates at the completion of the appointment is not eligible for the layoff provisions; however, if the employee is terminated from employment prior to the completion of the Fixed-Term I appointment, for reasons other than disciplinary dismissal, the section of this policy entitled Layoff Provisions shall be applicable, but in no event shall they be applicable beyond the Anticipated Ending Date of the appointment.\nNOTICE OF LAYOFF:\nWritten notice of layoff shall be provided to an employee by the work unit's Human Resources Representative, or a designee, four (4) weeks prior to the date of termination. The employee may work during the notice period at the discretion of the work unit. Any time paid, but not worked, during the four-week notice period will be deducted from the severance payment, as outlined in policy HR98, Severance Payment Provisions for Staff Employees.\nLAYOFF PROVISIONS:\nA laid off employee:\nis eligible to continue all group insurance coverages in which enrolled, during the first 120 calendar days of the layoff, by the employee's payment of contributions due during the layoff.\nhas educational privileges for the first 120 calendar days of the layoff.\nis eligible to use the Employee Assistance Program during the first 120 calendar days of the layoff.\ndoes not contribute to any retirement system in effect at the University unless paid for any days during the layoff, or unless the employee is a member of and makes private arrangements to contribute to TIAA-CREF.\nis paid for University holidays occurring during the first 30 days of the layoff.\ndoes not accumulate vacation and sick leave unless the employee is paid for enough days in any calendar month to qualify under the \"Vacation\" and \"Sick Leave\" sections.\nwill be paid the cash equivalent of all accumulated vacation and holiday compensatory time as of the layoff. Accumulated vacation and holiday compensatory time paid under this section will not be credited toward earning accumulated vacation or sick leave.\nis responsible for notifying the University of any change of address.\nEMPLOYMENT RESOURCES:\nThe Office of Human Resources will provide information and be available to employees for employment consultation as may be requested and deemed appropriate.\nSHORT-TERM CLOSEDOWN PROVISIONS:\nIn areas where employees are laid off during brief closedown periods, the following conditions apply:\nNotices of recall to work will be sent out in the reverse order of the layoff \u2014 last laid off, first recalled \u2014 provided that the employee is qualified to perform the work that is available.\nA notice of recall will be sent to an employee at his or her last known address at least 10 calendar days prior to the date on which the employee is to report back to work.\nIf an employee does not return to work on the date given in the notice of recall, his or her employment is terminated.

The following general guidelines will apply:\nThe agreement reached with the donor must be of an irrevocable nature -- charitable remainder trust, charitable gift annuity, estate note, etc.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where approval has been received, the donor must commit through a multi-year pledge of 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year until the endowment income becomes available.

This requirement also applies to the transfer of gas from one cylinder to another. This portion of the policy does not apply to scuba tanks or self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) tanks.\nChanging of compressed gas cylinders shall be done only by trained personnel.\nIt is illegal to change the stamped marks on any compressed gas cylinder.\nEach cylinder should be provided with the proper DOT label required for the gas contained.\nAll compressed gases shall be used only for their intended purpose.\nIf a non-DOT approved cylinder is found, the cost to transfer the contents to an approved cylinder and\/or the cost of disposal of the non-approved cylinder shall be the responsibility of the Department or Unit where the cylinder was found.\nSmoking shall not be permitted with 20 feet of any compressed gas cylinder.\nIt is recommended that compressed gas users review Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) before using any compressed gas.\nSPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:\nNo one shall deface or remove any markings, labels, decals, tags or stencil marks which have been applied\/attached for the identification of a cylinder. The cost of determining the contents of an unknown cylinder shall be the responsibility of the Department or Unit.\nIt is the ultimate responsibility of the cylinder user, upon returning an empty cylinder, to close valves and make certain that all valve caps are in place. Also, a tag shall be attached reading \"empty.\"\nCompressed gas cylinders shall not be subjected to a temperature above 125oF. Open flame should never be permitted to come into contact with any part of a compressed gas cylinder. Flames should be kept as far away as possible from compressed gas cylinders. When in doubt, flames should be kept at least 20 feet from any compressed gas cylinder.\nCylinders should not be subjected to artificially created low temperatures without the approval of the vendor due to possible decreased ductility of the steel at low temperatures.\nTampering with the safety relief devices in cylinder valves is not permitted.\nNo University personnel are to attempt to repair or alter cylinders, valves, or other safety relief devices.\nCylinders shall never be used as rollers, supports, or for any purpose other than to contain the contents as received.\nAll cylinder valves are to be kept closed at all times, except when the cylinder is in use.\nGeneral Stores or the vendor should be notified if any condition has occurred which may have permitted any foreign substance to enter a cylinder or valve.\nNo cylinder is to be placed where it might become part of a \"live\" electrical circuit.\nNo cylinders are to be repainted by University personnel unless authorized in writing by the vendor.\nAll cylinders, including empties, are to be adequately secured by strap rack, heavy gauge chain or clamp to prevent them from falling while in use, being transported, or being stored.\nMOVING CYLINDERS:\nWhenever removable caps are provided for valve protection, they shall be kept in place when the cylinder is not in use.\nCylinders shall never be lifted by the cap or valve.\nCylinders should never be dropped or permitted to come into violent contact with each other.\nMagnets, slings, ropes or chains shall not be used to handle any cylinder. A suitable \"truck\" or cylinder cart shall be used.\nAvoid dragging, rolling or sliding cylinders whenever possible.\nWhen cylinders are being transported by truck, fork lift or cylinder cart, they shall be firmly secured.\nTransportation of >1000 pounds, either separately or combined, of oxygen, non-flammable or flammable compressed gas requires a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) as per PA Code Title 75, Chapter 16.\nSTORAGE:\nAll cylinders shall be stored in accordance with all Local, State and Municipal regulations, and in accordance with standards of other authorities having jurisdiction over the University.\nAll cylinder storage areas shall be so posted with the names of the gases being stored.\nIf gases of different types are being stored at the same location, the cylinders should be grouped by types of gas, and these groups should be arranged to take into account the gases contained.\nExample: Flammable gases should be stored as far away as possible from oxidizing gases.\n\nFull and empty cylinders are to be stored separately.\nNo cylinder is to be stored near highly flammable substances such as oil, gasoline, etc.\nDue to the possibility of severe corrosion, cylinders shall not be exposed to continued dampness, nor near salt or other corrosives for extended periods.\nCylinders are not to be stored near elevators, ramps or paths of normal egress, or in locations where heavy objects may strike or fall on them.\nCylinders may be stored in the open as long as proper safeguards have been provided to prevent corrosion and protection from the elements.\nCylinders shall be stored in a location that minimizes the chance of tampering and vandalism. This may involve the construction of barriers.\nWITHDRAWING CYLINDER CONTENTS:\nOnly experienced and trained personnel should handle compressed gases.\nNo cylinder is to be used if the contents are not known or identified.\nProtective, removable caps are to be kept in place until the cylinder is to be used.\nApproved pressure regulating devices must be used in all cases when gas pressure in a system is to be lower than cylinder pressure.\nAt no time should connections between cylinder and auxiliary equipment be forced. If the threads do not match, return the cylinder to General Stores or the vendor. Teflon tapes should never be used on cylinder or regulator connections.\nWhen compressed gas cylinders are connected to a manifold, all related equipment should be of a design which has been approved by EHS.\nRegulators, gauges, hoses, and other appliances used with a particular gas or group of gases must not be used on cylinders containing gases having different chemical properties unless the vendor grants permission in writing.\nAll cylinder valves should be opened slowly to prevent ice formation. Appropriate tools should be used to tighten or loosen tank valves. If the valve will not readily open, return the cylinder to General Stores.\nCompressed gas shall not be used to remove foreign matter from clothing or any part of the human body.\nThe cylinder user shall make certain that all appliance connections are tight to prevent leakage. All connections shall be tested with a soapy water solution (\"Snoop\"). The system shall be slowly and partially pressurized and leak- tested before fully pressurizing the system.\nBefore a regulator is removed from a cylinder, the cylinder valve shall be closed and all pressure released from the regulator and system.\nFLAMMABLE GAS RESTRICTIONS:\nNo cylinders are to be stored near highly flammable solvents, combustible waste material, unprotected electrical connections, gas flames, or other sources of ignition.\nAt no time should a flame be used to detect a leak. A soapy water solution (\"Snoop\") or approved commercial leak detection solution shall be used.\nInside buildings, stored oxygen shall be separated from flammable gas cylinders by a minimum of 20 feet, or separated by a fire resistant partition with a height no less than that of the cylinders.\nAt no time shall smoking be permitted in any area where flammable gas cylinders are stored. Refer to University Policy AD32 for further information regarding the University's smoking policy.\nPOISON GAS RESTRICTIONS:\nNOTE: A poison gas is defined as one which rates a 3 or 4 in the health hazard section of an NFPA 704 diamond. \nBefore using a poison gas, all label information and Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) associated with the use of the particular poison gas shall be read. Users should be familiar with the hazards and health effects of the gas which they are using, and procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency. All plans and procedures involving poison gas usage shall be reviewed and approved by EHS prior to beginning use of the gas.\nIf EHS determines that respiratory protection is required, respirator selection and training shall be done by EHS in accordance with the University\u2019s Respiratory Protection Program.\n\nPoison gases should only be used in force-ventilated areas, preferably in hoods with forced ventilation, or outdoors.\nPoison gas cylinders should be of a size that will ensure the complete usage of the cylinder within a reasonable period of time.\nThe transportation of any amount of compressed poison gas requires a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) as per PA Code Title 75, Chapter 16.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther policies should also be referenced, especially the following:\nBS14 - Penn State Purchasing Card\nSY39 - Hazardous Chemical Inventory Management\nSY43 - Laboratory and Research Safety Plan\nEffective Date: November 18, 2016\n\tApproval Date: November 2, 2016\n\tDate Published: November 18, 2016 (Editorial changes- November 18, 2016)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 18, 2016 - Editorial changes.

In other words, it is an entire course, fully transportable, minus the specific discussions that may occur between faculty and student or among students within a specific offering of the course.\nCourseware modules: For the purposes of this policy a \"courseware module\" is defined as computer-based or substantially computer-based materials intended to enhance or supplement a Penn State residential or on-line course.\nCourseware modules are intended to enhance or supplement, but not replace, traditional classroom instruction.\nIt is anticipated that the goal of a substantial fraction of courseware modules will be to provide modest enhancements to existing and evolving courses and that much or most will be provided at no-cost or at the cost of distribution (that is, without royalties) to students in Penn State courses.\nExamples of courseware modules include digitized lectures, demonstrations, or experiments, computer-based or partially computer-based textbooks, software applications, or other instructional materials and course enhancements that support classroom lectures but are not integrated into complete courseware products.\nGENERAL:\nCourseware and courseware module development must be consistent with the primary obligations of University personnel to teaching, research, and service to the public.\nConflict of interest and\/or commitment can occur when University personnel develop courseware and courseware modules for personal financial gain rather than for the benefit of their teaching responsibilities at Penn State.\nThe sale or use of courseware or courseware modules in areas that substantially compete with Penn State educational programs is not allowed without prior University approval.\nWhere necessary, mechanisms whereby potential conflicts will be avoided shall be set forth in a Memorandum-of-Understanding (MOU).\nRequests for approval shall be signed by the University personnel involved in such activities, and forwarded by the appropriate Dean to the Vice President for Research who shall have authority to provide final approval.\nThe Vice President for Research, in consultation with the Chair of the University Faculty Senate, will appoint an advisory committee for courseware to monitor the effectiveness of the policy, to recommend updates as necessary, and to provide guidance for other courseware issues (including appeals) that may arise from time to time. The committee shall consist of five (5) faculty members representing a variety of disciplines, and members shall be appointed annually for a term of one year. Members may be reappointed for a maximum of three consecutive terms, but will be eligible for reappointment after a one year hiatus.\nPOLICY:\nUNIVERSITY-DIRECTED WORKS:\nDirected works are those created at the specific direction of a University unit for the University\u2019s ownership and use.\u00a0 Courseware or courseware modules will be deemed University-directed Works if they are created pursuant to a written agreement between the faculty member or staff member and the University unit or if the work is considered University-directed by the standing policy of the unit.\nEmployees in staff positions should clarify with their supervisors as to whether a particular project should be considered a University-directed work as part of the employee\u2019s normal duties.\u00a0 In cases of University-directed courseware or courseware modules, the University will own the copyright.\u00a0 Even in the cases of University-directed works, the Penn State author(s) will be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use the materials for their own limited purposes outside of the University. Rights of authors are subject to University policies on consulting activity and other activities external to the University, as well as to unique contractual obligations related to the production of the instructional materials.\nUniversity-directed works include, but are not limited to, courseware and courseware modules development specifically assigned or required as part of regular teaching duties.\nThe development of University-directed courseware and courseware modules may also be initiated by University personnel who desire financial support or assistance from the University, through the individual\u2019s academic department, college, or an administrative unit, for courseware development.\nThe University retains ownership and has legal responsibility for University-directed work and will oversee any publication of University-directed courseware and courseware modules.\nControl of University-directed courseware and courseware modules shall rest with the developing department or program.\nA written agreement between the University and the author(s) stating the scope and goals of the work should be signed at the start of the development process.\nThe agreement should also establish the extent to which materials may be used in derivative works published outside the University and will also formalize the relationship with authors outside the University (if any) and the procedure for the use of existing materials.\nShould the materials be distributed beyond the University's programs, the author may be eligible to receive reasonable royalty payments consistent with University policy IP04.\nUNIVERSITY PERSONNEL-INITIATED WORKS:\nIn some cases, University personnel may initiate the development of courseware and courseware modules independent of specific direction by the University. The author(s) of these materials will own the copyright. However, for works within the scope of the author\u2019s University employment, the University will be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the materials for instructional purposes within the University. Rights of authors are subject to University policies on consulting activity and other activities external to the University, as well as to unique contractual obligations related to the production of the instructional materials.\nWhether the work is undertaken for compensation or otherwise, the author has the responsibility to disclose the work to the author's department head\/division head or Dean\/Campus Executive Officer at the beginning of the development process.\nThe University will accept legal responsibility for the use of University personnel-initiated courseware and courseware modules in University programs; legal and financial responsibility for all other uses will rest with the author.\nControl of University personnel-initiated courseware and courseware modules used in University programs shall rest with the department or program that exercises the University\u2019s non-exclusive, royalty-free right of use, in consultation with the author.\nThe sale or use of University personnel-initiated courseware and courseware modules developed by Penn State personnel in circumstances that substantially compete with Penn State educational programs is not allowed without prior University approval.\nThe University will not otherwise interfere with the author\u2019s use of the courseware and courseware modules, and the author may arrange for non-competing use outside the University when this does not represent a conflict of interest or conflict of commitment. To that end, sponsoring academic units are encouraged to obtain a Creative Commons license for the materials.\nWhen exercising its non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the work, the University will ensure that proper credit is given to the author(s).\nIt is anticipated that the goal of a substantial fraction of University personnel-initiated courseware and courseware modules will be to provide modest enhancements to existing and evolving courses and the University will work to provide such works to students at no cost or minimal cost to the student.\nThe author may receive reasonable royalty payments for University personnel-initiated works used in Penn State courses consistent with University policy IP04.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research.\n CROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may have specific application and should be referred to, especially:\nHR91 - Conflict of Interest,\nIP01 - Patents and Copyrights (Intellectual Property)\nIP04\u2013 Royalty Payments for Course Materials, and\nIP06\u00a0- Technology Transfer and Entrepreneurial Activity (Faculty Research).\nEffective Date: January 7, 2013\n\tDate Approved: September 14, 2012\n\tPublished Date: January 7, 2013 (Editorial changes- November 19, 2015)\nMost Recent Changes:\nNovember 19, 2015 - Editorial changes.

International undergraduate programs offered for academic credit exclusively outside the United States.\nThis includes all full year, fall, spring, or summer semester programs administered by Education Abroad and other Penn State units (e.g. Outreach or campus offices of continuing education). Also included are undergraduate reciprocal exchange programs. All undergraduate education abroad programs offered for academic credit must secure initial approval by the associate dean or director of academic affairs of the sponsoring Penn State college or campus. Programs are then reviewed by the Directorate of Education Abroad and ultimately approved or not-approved by Global Programs. This is a one-time only review process.\n\u00a0\n\nGRADUATE EDUCATION ABROAD. International graduate courses offered for academic credit exclusively outside the United States.\nAll graduate courses offered for academic credit to be delivered in whole or in part outside the United States are required to obtain the approval of the associate dean of The Graduate School and must complete the Graduate Education Abroad Course Development Checklist for review by Global Programs. Review is required for each successive course implementation. [Please consult the Expedited Review Process of Limited Off-site Course Offerings. \u00a0When a program wishes to offer existing courses in this manner, the Graduate School limits the number of courses to three, after which the program must seek approval to deliver the degree program in this venue.]\n\u00a0\n\nEMBEDDED EDUCATION ABROAD. \u00a0 International undergraduate and graduate programs that include a brief experience abroad as a minor component (one credit or less) of a course for which the substantive content is provided within the United States.\nCourses that include a brief experience abroad as a minor component (one credit or less) for which the substantive content is provided within the United States are required to obtain the approval of the associate dean or director of academic affairs of the sponsoring Penn State college or campus (and the associate dean of the Graduate School for courses to be offered at the 500 and 800 levels) and must submit the program online\u00a0for review by Global Programs. Review is required for each successive implementation.\nEmbedded program leaders are required to participate in an emergency preparedness session offered by the Office of Global Programs prior to leading an embedded program.\u00a0 Once program leaders have participated in an emergency preparedness session offered by the Office of Global Programs, they will be required to retake the session after two years if they lead another embedded program abroad.\n\u00a0\n\nNON-CREDIT BEARING INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS.  International undergraduate and graduate programs offered outside the United States exclusively or in-part and for which participants do not earn academic credit. \u00a0\nAll non-credit bearing, international programs must secure approval by the associate dean or director of academic affairs of the sponsoring Penn State college or campus and must complete the International Group Risk Management Checklist  for review by Risk Management. Review is required for each successive implementation.\n\u00a0\n\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL: All other international student travel requires approval from the appropriate dean or chancellor. Travel arrangements may vary, and can be made through any of the approved University sources.\n\nDOMESTIC TRAVEL:\nStudent group travel to locations within the continental United States will range from an extended stay in another part of the country to a trip within the state. As with field trips, if students are traveling as a group organized by the University, then they must be accompanied by a University employee acting within the scope of his or her employment, and appropriate approvals must be in place.\nACADEMIC FIELD TRIPS:\nAcademic field trips are common and range from an afternoon outing to a several-day trip out of town. Risk and liability issues have recently emerged concerning academic field trips. At the present time, no University policy exists for local and domestic field trips. It is important that University departments and faculty\/staff\/students follow adequate procedures to ensure the safety of field trip participants and to reduce liability and risk to the University.\nGuidelines\n\tThese guidelines were taken from the Financial Officers' Web site. Please note that this document is not an official policy statement. The Department of Risk Management should be consulted if you have any questions concerning safety and\/or liability issues when planning a student field trip. The Department of Risk Management maintains a Web site at http:\/\/controller.psu.edu\/risk-management.\u00a0It currently has sections of the Web site relating to insurances, contracts, and a listing of charter bus operators who have met the University's minimum auto liability insurance requirements.\n\tThe following are suggested guidelines that should be followed when planning an academic field trip:\n\t\t\u00a0\nAny external field trip agreements, applications, releases or similar documents, all of which are considered \"contracts\", must be reviewed by the Department of Risk Management and signed by an Assistant Treasurer in advance of the field trip (in accordance with policy FN11).\nA University employee is required to accompany a group if the field trip is sponsored by the University.\nA campus, college, or department should retain a list of students traveling on a field trip. A contact person, who remains on campus, should be identified in the event of an emergency.\nAn itinerary should be available to the academic department or campus, especially if a field trip involves visiting multiple locations.\nEmergency communications should be available at all times. A working cell phone would be sufficient for this purpose. If the field trip is in a remote location, emergency transportation should be available at all times during the field trip.\nPersonal vehicles should not be used to transport students to the field trip location. The University should provide transportation if the event is sponsored by the University.\nFor lengthy field trips in distant locations within the United States or its territories, the Risk Management International Travel Checklist form (pdf) should be completed and followed. Unlike international travel, this form does not require Dean or CEO approval. It also does not need to be forwarded to the Department of Risk Management. However, it provides a good format to follow for lengthy out-of-state visits.\n\tTo help protect both the University and its employees, the following should occur:\nEach college and\/or campus location should have a procedure for faculty to notify their respective department or campus of field trips in advance.\nThe purpose of the trip must be relevant to the University's academic mission and any University employee in charge of or helping to supervise the field trip must be acting within the scope of his or her employment.\nIf an injury occurs on a field trip, the appropriate University injury report forms (different ones for employee vs. nonemployee) must be completed. The accident should be reported immediately to the College or Campus Safety Officer.\n Frequently Asked Questions About Academic Field Trips\n\t\t\u00a0\nHow is an academic field trip differentiated from other trips (e.g., student organization trips)?\nAn academic field trip is defined as an academic experience sponsored by the University. By definition, the University is in direct control of the event if it is sponsoring the trip.\n\nWhat if the event is not \"academic\" in nature, but is more a \"social\" experience that is still sponsored by the University?\nIf the University is the official sponsor of the event, then the University needs to be in direct control and assume responsibility for the event.\n\nHow is \"direct control\" defined?\nIf the University sponsors the event, the University is responsible for properly supervising the activities of the event.\n\nIf a student organization sponsors a field trip, is this under the \"direct control\" of the University?\no Risk Management defines a field trip to mean an academic class experience under the control of a Penn State faculty employee and, therefore, by definition no student organization can sponsor a field trip.\n\nIs a University employee required to accompany a group if the field trip is an academic requirement or a University-sponsored academic experience?\nYes\n\nRisk Management approves charter bus agreements. If a department or group charters a bus for an event (e.g., a Penn State football game), is the trip \"sponsored\" by the University?\nRisk Management reviews any bus charter agreements that are in the name of the University and it is presumed that a University employee accompanies the charter. If an employee is not accompanying the charter, the bus trip should not occur.\n\nIs the University responsible for an individual's behavior on a field trip? Should a \"Standards of Conduct Agreement\" be utilized?\nThe University is not responsible for the behavior of individuals. The University would not require a conduct agreement, but it may be considered for use, and sometimes is, by an individual department or campus.\n\nWhat type of emergency preparedness or communications is required for field trips?\nEmergency communications should be available at all times on a field trip. A working cell phone would be sufficient for this purpose. If the field trip is in a remote location, emergency transportation should be available at all times during the field trip.\n\nCan personal vehicles be used to transport individuals to a University-sponsored field trip?\nIf the activity is sponsored and planned by the University, travel is to be provided by the University and would include an employee accompanying the group to and from the activity. In other words, the University has a duty to provide safe transportation for University-sponsored events.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: January 1, 2010\n\tDate Approved: December 23, 2009\n\tDate Published:\u00a0 January 1, 2010 (Editorial changes- September 27, 2013)\nMost Recent Changes:\nSeptember 27, 2013 - Editorial changes.

This requirement is true for all gifts, grants, and contracts, as well as deposits into Miscellaneous General Research accounts or their equivalent. In order to appropriately classify its income, University Financial Officers, Development Officers, and Research Administrators must complete a questionnaire to determine and document the type of financial assistance being provided by sponsors or donors to support sponsored programs. (See: http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/osp\/gift-questionnaire.)\nDEFINITIONS:\nA Stewardship Report\u00a0states how funds were used, and may include a general financial report, a brief summary of how the funding was used, and\/or the impact of the gift. A stewardship report may not be a detailed technical report. However, if publications result, copies of such publications may be shared with the donor. In addition, confirmation of proper utilization of funds is allowed. For example, if a company provided funds to help students build a solar-powered vehicle for a national student competition, the Principal Investigator (PI) could provide the donor with a report informing how the students did in the competition, but not be required to provide detailed technical information including raw data.\nFacilities and administrative (\"F&A\") costs\u00a0are those expenses that are essential to the conduct of sponsored institutional activities but which cannot be readily attributed and directly charged to specific individual projects. \u00a0F&A costs are more fully defined in University Policy RA30 \u2013 Facilities & Administrative (F&A) Costs.\nFinancial Assistance\u00a0is money provided to support a public purpose, e.g., health related research. Financial Assistance includes Gifts, Charitable Grants, Unrestricted Grants, and Restricted Grants, as defined below. Financial assistance is distinguished from\u00a0Procurements, which involve payment for a specific product or service, e.g., drug testing for a pharmaceutical company.\nQuid Pro Quo is a situation where goods and\/or services (i.e., a \"deliverable\") are provided at least in part as consideration for funding. Acknowledgements and Stewardship Reports are not considered deliverables.\nCharitable Contribution is Financial Assistance in the form of a Gift, Charitable Grant, or Unrestricted Grant, as defined below. It is important to look at both the intent of the donor\/grantor and the other requirements of the grant to determine whether it qualifies as a Gift, Charitable Grant, or Unrestricted Grant. Faculty members should work with their units' Development Office in securing charitable contributions and to help establish the intent of the donor\/grantor.\nGifts, Charitable Grants, and Unrestricted Grants are Financial Assistance donated or otherwise made to support the operations or other activities undertaken by the University where the donor\/grantor may direct the general purpose of the funds but the actual expenditure of funds is not controlled by the donor\/grantor and where there is no Quid Pro Quo. In other words, the intent of the donor is philanthropic.\nRestricted Grants and Contracts are contractually binding arrangements which establish a Quid Pro Quo relationship or where the grantor controls the expenditure of the funds.\nA Gift is a Charitable Contribution from an individual, a for-profit organization, or a non-profit organization. To qualify as a Gift, the Financial Assistance must be accompanied by a letter clearly identifying it as a Gift or Donation. Gifts can be targeted to a specific area (e.g., Ceramic Science), but there can be no obligation to submit detailed technical or financial reports beyond a Stewardship Report, nor can there be any contractual terms and conditions. The University will assess 0% F&A on Gifts. Donors frequently use the terms \"gift\" and \"grant\" interchangeably to describe the donation of funds; however, the terminology used by the donor or sponsor should not determine the University's categorization of the funds on The Funding Matrix (below).\nA Charitable Grant is a Charitable Contribution from an individual, a for-profit organization, or a non-profit organization that may specify limited terms and conditions. For example, if the terms and conditions serve to direct the gift to areas of a particular purpose, such as scholarships, programs, infrastructure, or general research support of interest to the donor, the grant may be classified as a charitable grant.\u00a0The grantor may not provide oversight of the expenditure of donated funds. The grantor may receive a gift receipt, a gift acknowledgement, and\/or a Stewardship Report. \u00a0 Some indications that the award is not a charitable grant and should be classified as a restricted grant or sponsored research include: studies are to be conducted on substances\/products\/processes, etc., in which the grantor has a financial interest; the grantor hopes to gain economic benefits as a result of the activity to be conducted; the grantor expects to receive a technical report; or the grantor participates in determining the work to be performed or services to be provided on the project.\u00a0 Establishing the donor's intent will usually answer the question as to the proper classification.\nIf the grantor is a domestic organization and has published guidelines (or otherwise verifiable written policy) prohibiting or limiting the recovery of F&A costs on charitable contributions, the University may accept the lesser rate or amount, if it considers the program desirable for University participation (as evidenced by the approval of the College\/Unit on the appropriate Internal Approval Form), without requiring central approval.\u00a0 With published guidelines limiting recovery of F&A, the University will accept the reduced F&A rate.\u00a0 In the absence of published guidelines, the University will assess F&A at 15% of Total Costs on domestic organizations, unless an alternate rate is approved by the Vice President for Research or the Corporate Controller, in consultation with the Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations when appropriate. These funds will not be used in calculating research incentive funds (unless the F&A is greater than 15%), and the 15% rate does not support unemployment coverage.\u00a0 If the grantor is foreign, a lower F&A rate will not be accepted (unless a formal waiver is approved in accordance with RA30).\u00a0 It should be noted that if the grantor is a for-profit entity and the Charitable Grant is closely tied to a pre-existing or simultaneously awarded sponsored activity, it will be evaluated on its specific merits to determine if full F&A should be assessed.\nAn Unrestricted Grant is a Charitable Contribution much like a Gift, except it is not accompanied by a letter identifying it as such. Typically, when the University receives money without any terms and conditions, and the money is clearly intended as Financial Assistance (as opposed to a Procurement), the Financial Assistance will be identified as an Unrestricted Grant. Such grants are assessed F&A at 15% Total Costs. These funds will not be used in calculating research incentive funds, and the 15% rate does not support unemployment coverage.\nA Restricted Grant is a form of Financial Assistance provided by a for-profit organization or a non-profit organization1\u00a0where the sponsor expects detailed technical reports. In addition to the detailed technical report, the agreement underlying the Restricted Grant may contain other specific terms and conditions, including financial reporting requirements. Restricted Grants are normally assessed full F&A, unless exceptions identified in Policy RA30 apply.\nA Contract is a form of Procurement provided by a for-profit organization or a non-profit organization1. Contracts can come in many forms (e.g., Sponsored Research Agreements, Service Agreements, Purchase Orders). Contracts supported with federal flow-through funds are assessed full F&A, unless federal funding restrictions apply. Contracts funded by industrial Internal Research and Development (IRAD) funds are assessed full F&A plus 5%.\nAn Industry Membership Agreement may take the form of a Restricted Grant or a Contract. In either case, F&A is assessed at 15% Total Costs. These funds will not be used in calculating research incentive funds, and the 15% rate does not support unemployment coverage. See RAG05 for more detail regarding Industry Memberships programs.\nThe Funding Matrix - The matrix below is intended to identify typical terms and conditions associated with different\u00a0varieties of private Financial Assistance and Procurements. The Vice President for Research\u00a0or\u00a0the Corporate Controller,\u00a0in consultation with\u00a0the Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations when appropriate, may\u00a0approve\u00a0exceptions under special circumstances.

Membership on the faculty or staff of The Pennsylvania State University carries with it additional responsibilities of citizenship which reflect (a) the educator's function as a source of informed, objective counsel, and (b) the compact through which the University receives public funds for use in meeting society's educational and research needs.\nKIND OF PUBLIC SERVICE:\nThe kinds of public service defined are as follows:\nPublic service of a professional character,\nHolding public office at any (federal, state, or local) level.\nPUBLIC SERVICE OF A PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER DEFINED:\nBy virtue of their comprehension of certain areas of human knowledge, University personnel may be asked to serve as:\nExpert witnesses whose testimony is sought in establishing, clarifying or interpreting the facts in a matter of public interest.\nProfessional members of ad hoc task forces appointed by public officials to prepare factual reports on matters of public interest.\nProfessional consultants on matters of personal competence to governmental agencies or task forces.\nCONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE MAY BE PERFORMED:\nIt is the policy of the University to do what it can, on request, to make its personnel available for public service of a professional character:\nIf the individual's University duties can continue to be performed satisfactorily;\nIf the individual confines his or her testimony or counsel to matters within his or her professional competence needed by public officials in weighing the relative merits of alternate courses of action; and\nIf the individual's remuneration beyond out-of-pocket expense does not infringe on regulations binding on the University.\nNOTIFICATION TO THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT SUCH SERVICE:\nAll personnel requested by public officials to perform such services shall notify their respective deans or administrative officers of the nature and conditions of the assignment, remuneration expected (if any), and the effect the assignment will have on performance of the employee's duties at the University.\nCAMPAIGNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE:\nUnder existing University policies, members of its faculty and staff may campaign for any public office without modification of the terms and conditions of their University status if the campaign does not interfere (in any way deemed significant by officers of the University) with the performance of assigned University duties. If the campaign does interfere with the performance of assigned University duties, the individual must resign from his or her position with the University, or petition for a leave of absence without salary from academic or other non-administrative duties. A leave of absence from administrative duties is not granted to campaign for an elective public office.\nIn such campaign activities, the individual's relationship to the University is not to be exploited either directly or by indirection.\nELECTION OR APPOINTMENT TO PUBLIC OFFICE:\nIf elected or appointed, a member of the faculty or staff may accept a public office (e.g., membership on borough councils, local school boards) that does not interfere with the individual's performance of assigned University duties without modification of the terms and conditions of his or her University status.\nIf elected or appointed to an office that would interfere in any way deemed significant by officers of the University with the performance of assigned University duties, the individual must resign from his or her position with the University, or petition for leave of absence without salary from academic or other non-administrative duties. A leave of absence from administrative duties is not granted to serve in an elective or appointive public office.\nENDORSEMENT OF POLITICAL CANDIDATES OR CAUSES:\nEffective democracy provides the right of every private citizen to endorse a specific political candidate or cause. However, such endorsement should not infer or reflect the support of the University for such political candidate or cause.\nThe University assumes no responsibility for the endorsement of a political candidate or cause by members of its faculty or staff. Except for the limited purpose of identifying the University as the employer of the faculty or staff member making a political endorsement, the name of the University is not to be connected with such an endorsement in any way. No endorsement shall be made on the official stationery of the University, nor on stationery having the University address or a University telephone number.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially:\nHR42 - Payment of Personal Compensation by a State Agency or Department of the Commonwealth.\nHR80 - Private Consulting Practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the policy under which a faculty or staff member may provide public service."},{"university":"psu","name":"ad96","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcceptable Use of University Information Resources | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesAcceptable Use of University Information Resources \n\n\n\nAdministrative Policies\n\nAD96\nAcceptable Use of University Information Resources\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice President for Administration>\nContents\nPurpose\nScope\nPolicyGeneral Consent\nPrinciples of Acceptable Use\nProtecting the Security and Integrity of Information Resources from Unauthorized use\n\nExceptions and Exemptions\nPolicy Violations\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nSCOPE:\nThis policy is applicable to all faculty, staff, students, and other individuals using Penn State's network resources, and individuals who are conducting Penn State business using external networks.\nThis includes all University owned, licensed, or managed hardware and software, the use of University network via a physical or wireless connection, regardless of the ownership of the computer or device connected to the network, and use of information.\nThis policy excludes Penn State Health and The Pennsylvania College of Technology, which will follow separate policies.\nPOLICY:\nI.

PROTECTING THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF INFORMATION RESOURCES FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE:\nIn order to protect the security and integrity of Information Resources against unauthorized or improper use, and to protect authorized individuals from the effects of any potential abuse or negligence, the University reserves the rights, at its sole discretion, to limit, restrict, or terminate any account or use of Information Resources, and to inspect, copy, remove or otherwise alter any data, file, or system resources that may undermine authorized use. The University also reserves the right to inspect or check the configuration of Information Resources for compliance with this policy, and to take such other actions as in its sole discretion it deems necessary to protect University Information Resources. The University also reserves the right to control and\/or manage use of the frequency spectrum within the boundaries of all University locations. Individuals of the University are required to report transmitting devices and their characteristics to University officials, if so requested. The University reserves the right to require those units or individuals found to have such devices that interfere or are suspected to interfere with operation of centrally managed University systems, to discontinue use of such devices, and, if necessary, to remove them from University property.\nThe University shall not be liable for, and the individual assumes the risk of, inadvertent loss of data or interference with files resulting from the University's efforts to maintain the privacy, integrity and security of the University's Information Resources.\nThe University is not responsible for the content of individuals\u2019 personal web spaces, nor the content of servers, programs or files that individuals maintain either in their personally allocated file areas on University-owned computer resources or on personally-owned computers connected to the University's Information Resources.\nThe University reserves the right to suspend network access or computer account(s), or to impose sanctions as defined in this policy if individually-maintained files, programs or services are believed to have been operating in violation of either law or policy.

With position management each position of a standing or a fixed term multi-year nature is provided for and is shown in the budget at the annual salary rate, regardless of the actual amount payable to each employee during the year. Thus, a change in salary, an anticipated retirement, or the creation of a new position during the year requires budget provisions for the total annual salary on a permanent basis, regardless of the amount to be expended from the budget for the position during the current year.\nPERMANENTLY BUDGETED POSITIONS:\nAuthorized positions are arranged in the departmental budgets by payroll classification by numerical identification as follows:\nExecutive (0101)\nAdministrator (0102)\nAcademic Administrator (0103)\nAcademic (0104)\nFixed Term Multi-Year Academic (0174)\nExempt Staff (0105)\nNonexempt Staff (0106)\nTechnical Service (0108)\nPayroll classifications of standing and fixed term multi-year positions remain permanently in existing budgets so long as the nature and duties of the position are unchanged. A reclassification of a position authorized by the Office of Human Resources during the year requires a budget amendment to reflect a change in the permanent budget.\nTRANSFERS FROM WAGES OR DEPARTMENTAL ALLOTMENT FOR SALARY INCREASES OR NEW POSITIONS:\nIf wages or departmental allotment provisions are reduced during the year to provide for a new position, or for an increase in an existing position, the portion of the annual salary applicable to the period preceding the effective date may be restored on a temporary basis to the budget which was reduced at that time (see Policy BT04).\nEXCESS SALARY PAYMENTS:\nIf it is necessary to overlap appointments in the process of replacing a person, the additional budget requirement must be provided on a temporary basis to cover the amount of salary overlap. Maximum periods of overlap will be determined by the Office of Human Resources (see Policy HR67).\nAny unused vacation payable upon resignation, military leave of absence, etc. for Standing, Fixed Term Multi-Year, or Fixed-Term I appointments must be provided in the departmental budget on a temporary basis.\nFIXED-TERM MULTI-YEAR ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS:\nFixed-Term Multi-Year Academic positions must be committed on a permanent basis from the Fixed-Term Multi-Year Academic budget category before appointments can be made. Fixed-Term Multi-Year appointments for two years or less may be permanently budgeted using fund 39990 to permit funding flexibility. The position appears as a line item on the departmental budget position schedule and is assigned a position number on the payroll record (see Policy HR06).\nFIXED-TERM APPOINTMENTS:\nProvision for Fixed-Term appointments is included in the budget in a total dollar amount and designated as Non-Standing Academic or Non-Standing Non-Academic salaries. Total salaries allocated to Fixed-Term appointments must not exceed the total dollar amount provided in the budget for Non-Standing Academic or Non-Standing Non-Academic salaries.

All interdepartmental leases, rental, and service agreements must be made by standing orders.\nThe body of the documents used to establish a blanket or standing order MUST also contain the name(s) of the individual(s) authorized to make releases\/requests against the orders, the location(s) to which goods or services are to be delivered or made, and the stated maximum dollar limit for the total of all purchases to be made against the blanket or standing order.\nVERBAL REQUESTS FOR PURCHASES BETWEEN UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS:\nVerbal requests may not be used to circumvent Policy FN18 approval requirements. Policy FN18 requires that APPROPRIATE WRITTEN OR IBIS APPROVALS EXIST BEFORE ANY CHARGES CAN BE SUBMITTED TO ACCOUNTING OPERATIONS for processing. It does not require that those approvals exist at the time a purchase request is made between two departments within the University.\nSound business practice dictates that transactions between a department making a purchase and the supplying department must be documented either in writing or electronically through a system such as IBIS\/EASY. Such documentation provides increased control and accuracy in processing a transaction. However, for the sake of customer service, a supplying department may wish to occasionally accept a verbal purchase request to expedite a purchase with the understanding that the required Policy FN18 approvals will be provided to the supplying department later. This is permissible, but the supplying department will be at risk. Until a supplying department has in its possession, or has access to, the required Policy FN18 approvals (written or IBIS-documented), the transaction shall not be enforceable and charges may not be submitted for processing.\nIt is up to the budget administrator of the department making a purchase request and the respective Financial Officer to decide if verbal requests will be allowed to be made. It is up to the budget administrator of the supplying department and the respective Financial Officer to decide if verbal requests will be accepted.\nVERBAL AMENDMENTS TO DOCUMENTS USED FOR PURCHASES BETWEEN UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS:\nIt is not permissible to verbally amend a document that has been approved by a budget executive, budget administrator, budget assistant, Financial Officer, financial assistant, or their valid proxies, if the verbal amendment would change the intent of the purchase, increase the cost of the purchase, or if the supplying department prohibits verbal amendments.\nSome examples of permissible verbal amendments to internal purchase documents:\nChanging the color of envelopes from blue to white with no cost increase.\nDecreasing the quantity of pencils from 10 gross to 5 gross.\nCanceling a line item.\nSome examples of non-permissible verbal amendments to internal purchase documents:\nChanging the color of envelopes from white to blue at additional cost.\nIncreasing the quantity of pencils from 4 gross to 8 gross.\nAdding a line item.\nChanging an order for a book to an order for a sweatshirt.\nChanging the account distribution.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nFN14 - Use of University Tangible Assets, Equipment, Supplies and Services, and\nBS15 - Disposal and Purchase of Obsolete, Surplus or Scrap University-Owned Equipment, Supplies and\/or Materials.\nEffective Date: December 3, 2015\n\tDate Approved: December 1, 2015\n\tDate Published: December 3, 2015\nMost Recent Changes:\nDecember 3, 2015 - Changes to the INTERDEPARTMENTAL TRANSFER (INTERDEPARTMENTAL CHARGES AND CREDITS), SPECIAL PROVISIONS (OPP and Faculty\/Staff Personal Purchases Discount sections added), DIRECT BILLING, INTERDEPARTMENTAL BLANKET ORDER AND STANDING ORDER, and VERBAL AMENDMENTS TO DOCUMENTS USED FOR PURCHASES BETWEEN UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS sections to reflect current processes by which University departments can obtain goods and services from other University departments.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nSeptember 27, 2013 - Editorial changes.

The Department of University Police and Public Safety leads this review and obtains a wide range of information from other stakeholders to assist in doing so. These proactive measures are intended to enhance safety inside and outside University owned or operated venues, and to improve the overall experience at University events for both participants and attendees. Controlling the ingress of items entering University venues is a key component in achieving University safety goals.\nSCOPE\nThis policy applies to all University locations and facilities owned or operated by the University.\nPOLICY\nDepending on the capacity of the venue, the following guidelines must be observed with regard to items brought into University facilities:\nWhere the venue holds more the 20,000 individuals (such as Beaver Stadium), the following items are\/are not permitted, as specified below:\nOne clear plastic, flat-seamed (not rectangular-bottomed), one-gallon plastic bag per person will be permitted for:\nMedical needs\nChild care needs\nGeneral items as needed (see next bullet)\n\nItems that can fit in a pocket should remain in patrons' pockets (including but not limited to keys, cell phone, wallet, glasses, camera, sunscreen, lip balm, make-up). General items of this nature, including those that don't fit in patrons' pocket, can also be placed in a clear plastic one-gallon plastic bag.\nAll clear bags will be inspected through the bag and article check stations.\nThose patrons without bags will be able to bypass the bag and article check stations at most gates.\nAttendees are permitted to bring loose items, including:\nCoat\nWristlet with or without a strap (no larger than 4\" x 6\" x 1\")\nBlanket\nSeat cushion that can be rolled and that does not have pockets\niPad or other mobile devices\nCamera (no camera bag)\nBinoculars (no case or bag)\n\nBabies may be brought into athletic venues in a soft baby carriers or a sling.

Other items, including purses and smaller bags, regardless of size, will be inspected and allowed in the venue upon inspection. During certain events, additional restrictions may be implemented at the discretion of facility management.\nWhere the venue holds 3,000 individuals or less, all items being brought into the venue are subject to inspection.\u00a0During certain events, additional restrictions may be implemented at the discretion of facility management.\nOutdoor venues\/events  (such as Movin' On, 5K road races) which could exceed 3,000 individuals will be considered on a case by case basis. Additional restrictions may be implemented at the discretion of the management in charge of the event.\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\nPenn State University Police and Public Safety\nEnforce applicable University policies and best security practices, as appropriate.\nProvide guidance on policy implementation.\nWork with facility management to establish and update rules and guidelines, when situationally appropriate.\nPerform pre-event planning and assessment, as appropriate.\nProvide police or security staff to support implementation of this policy at events.\nFacility Manager\nInform staff of the rules of the venue, and their responsibilities as employees of the venue.\nCoordinate pre-event planning and assessment with University Police and other entities, as appropriate.\nImplement additional restrictions, as needed, in consultation with the applicable public safety authority.\nThe day of the event, comply and enforce the guidelines specified in this policy.\nProvide staff who are properly trained to carry out the provisions of this policy at events on campus.\nFURTHER INFORMATION\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Assistant Vice President, Police & Public Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES\nSY01 - Environmental Health and Safety Policy\nAD65 - Electronic Security and Access Systems (formerly SY33)\nAD68 - University Access Policy\nAD70 - Emergency Management\nAD78 - Threats to Campus Safety\nEffective Date: September 22, 2015\u00a0\n\tDate Approved: September 22, 2015\n\tDate Published: September 22, 2015\nMost Recent Changes:\nSeptember 22, 2015 - Changes were made in the POLICY section to better clarify details for clear plastic bags that are allowed to be brought into University facilities  Where the venue holds more than 20,000 (such as Beaver Stadium).

Operations and maintenance typically includes the day-to-day activities necessary for the building and its systems and equipment to perform their intended function. Operations and maintenance are combined into the common term O&M because a facility cannot operate at peak efficiency without being maintained; therefore the two are discussed as one.\n\t\tMajor Maintenance -\n\t\tMajor Maintenance is repairs, replacement, or refurbishment done to assets such as building systems or other facilities which have a cost above the level of funding available in annual operating budgets. \u00a0Normally such repair costs are at least $5,000 for single projects. Major maintenance frequency is based on the life cycle of the asset and is normally in longer intervals like five to fifty years depending on the useful life of the asset.\n\t\tCapital Projects -\n\t\tSee Board of Trustees Bylaws.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nPOLICY:\nFacility administration responsibilities of OPP include:\nPlanning and Land Use\nLead the programming, development, and implementation of campus master plans (land use, building opportunities, future utility systems and infrastructure, parking, etc.), sub-district plans, and college\/unit master plans for all campuses, colleges, and units.\nPerform site selection studies and feasibility studies for new buildings, building additions, recreation facilities, parking, public spaces, etc.\nManage, maintain, and implement the Capital Plan within financial parameters as approved by the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business.\nGuide conformance with municipal zoning and land development processes.\nLead the design and installation of all directional signs, building identification signs, and temporary banners.\nDevelop intermodal transportation plans that accommodate vehicles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians.\nLead the process to select sites for and approve the installation of temporary and permanent public art and sculpture at the UP campus.

The activities should be extensive in scale.\nResearch Consortia  should be collectives of two or more (probably more) entities which could include internal units, e.g., colleges and external units, company members, etc. These activities should be extensive in scale and scope.\nResearch Centers should:\nhave an identifiable focus\nhave on-going funding\nhave funding including multiple grants and contracts; not a single grant\nengage multiple faculty (more than 2) and graduate students (optimal but not a requirement)\nhave some clearly identified rationale for being established\nIndustry Membership Program provides for industry members to support a program of research in a general field of study.\u00a0 Membership does not provide any claim to intellectual properties resulting from the research.\nGUIDELINES AND PRINCIPLES:\nEstablishing Research Institutes, Consortia, and Centers:\nSpecial consideration will be given to the formation of entities if a funding agency mandates a particular title; e.g., a Center Grant from the NSF or if a development opportunity evolves around formation of an entity and the donor wishes a particular designation for the entity, e.g., XX (donor's name) Institute for Y activity.\nAll newly formed entities should have a provision in their charter for a review to be conducted no less often than once every five years. Guidelines should define the conditions necessary for continuation of these entities.\nEstablishing an Industry Membership Program:\nPenn State\u2019s industry membership program is designed to provide for fundamental research, enhance the flow of information between the University and the industry members, provide the members with access to students as potential future employees, keep members informed of promising technology developments, and provide other potential benefits as a result of ongoing contact between creative individuals. The program objectives and descriptions are detailed in membership agreements that govern the membership program.\u00a0 Because the nature of these programs offer the potential for diversion of academic objectives, it is important that membership-supported research programs be organized and maintained in ways that preserve both the independence and integrity of the University.\nPrinciples That Apply to All Industry Membership Programs:\nSupport research in general areas that are of interest to multiple industry organizations;\nProvide opportunity for interaction between industry members, faculty members, and students;\nPromote access to research results in a timely manner;\nEnrich students\u2019 and postdocs\u2019 educational experience;\nMaintain the University\u2019s role as a credible and impartial resource; and\nContribute to the University\u2019s primary mission of teaching and research.\nAll Industry Membership Programs Shall Abide by the following Guidelines:\nIndustry Membership Programs shall be subject to the unrestricted grant facilities and administrative rate of 15% of the total award amount. (Note: Certain Federal agenices may impose additional limitations on F&A recovery, e.g., NSF I\/UCRCs).\nAccess to membership in Industry Membership Programs should be available equally to all companies prepared to meet the obligations of membership as set forth by each program. \u00a0Membership agreement and benefits shall be reasonable and consistent with the goals of each program and these Guidelines.\nIndustry Membership Programs can offer facilitated access to Penn State\u2019s research programs and to relevant faculty members and students. Non-member companies must not be excluded from access to such resources, but their access may sometimes be in a less convenient form.\nMembers may gain early access to the results of research activities funded by membership fees through their interactions with faculty members and students and their participation in the research and program activities.\u00a0 Research results will be published on a timely basis so as to preserve openness in research and dissemination of research results.\nUniversity intellectual property generated under research sponsored by membership fees may be offered to members under terms consistent with University policy.\u00a0 Access to University background intellectual property may be available for research and commercialization activities under the Industry Membership Program on a case by case basis, and subject to any preexisting rights to such technology.\nIndustry Membership Programs should not be used to perform sponsored research to provide unique or preferential benefits to individual members.\u00a0 Separate sponsored research agreements shall be used to perform research with specific costs, schedules, and\/or deliverables that benefit individual member(s) rather than all members.\nWhile members may offer suggestions for research activities, the involved faculty member must be free to select research topics, adopt research methodology, select participants, and direct research funded by the programs.\nREQUIRED APPROVALS:\nApproval Process for Establishing New Research Institutes, Consortia, and Centers:\nAll newly formed Research Institutes, Consortia, and Centers should be established with the approval of the Vice President for Research.\u00a0 Approvals will be forwarded from the Vice President for Research to the Executive Vice President and Provost.\nApproval Process for Establishing an Industry Membership Program:\nRequests to establish an Industry Membership Program should be directed in writing to the Vice President for Research, with the concurrence of the Department Chair\/Director and\/or Dean. The request should include the following:\nName of the individual who will coordinate the program.\nBrief description of the proposed program.\nSpecific benefits to be offered to members.\nAnticipated number of faculty and graduate students who will participate.\nDraft of the proposed membership agreement(s).\nAnticipated number of members by category.\nPerson responsible for invoicing and collecting membership fees.\nThe Office of the Vice President for Research will retain a listing of all approved Industry Membership Programs. Additional information, specific to the Membership Program Agreement template, is available at the Office of the Vice President for Research website.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research, or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tPublished Date: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nApril 13, 2018 - Clarification added regarding Federally imposed F&A restrictions\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This policy was previously a Research Administration policy, RAG18.

This policy is applicable to all University locations (except the College of Medicine and Hershey Medical Center which conducts independent biosafety committee reviews), and to research conducted off-site by University personnel. University projects involving the use of regulated\/biohazardous materials at other institutions shall receive Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approval from the cooperating institution. In the case of collaboration between the College of Medicine\/Hershey Medical Center (Hershey) and any other University location, Hershey will be treated as a cooperating institution.Copies of IBC approvals from cooperating institutions should be forwarded to the Office for Research Protections (ORP) along with a completed IBC application. The IBC may require approval from the cooperating institution prior to granting its approval.\nPOLICY:\nAll University research and instructional activities involving regulated\/biohazardous materials, as defined below, must be reviewed and approved by the IBC prior to the use of any such reagent. \u00a0Additionally, the acquisition of Regulated\/Biohazard Material requiring handling conditions at BSL-2 or higher must have IBC review and approval prior to the purchase or transfer of said materials to the University. Projects submitted for sponsorship by external agencies should be submitted for IBC review prior to acceptance of funding. The ORP, The 330 Building, Suite 205, University Park, PA 16802 (814-865-1775) coordinates IBC reviews and approvals. The IBC is vested with the right and authority to monitor the use and\/or procurement of regulated\/biohazardous material as approved hereunder.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nBudget executives and budget administrators shall ensure that all supervisors in their area are familiar with the provisions of this policy.Supervisors (department chairs, faculty and other employees with direct oversight of University employees and students) shall ensure that all University research is conducted in compliance with this policy. Employees and students shall ensure that their activities comply with any and all safety policies and procedures mandated by this policy.\nDEFINITIONS:\nRegulated\/Biohazardous Material -\nThe categories below represent the areas of primary concern with respect to biosafety. Projects involving material(s) included by any of these categories should be submitted for IBC approval.\nChemical Carcinogens used in conjunction with animals.\nToxic\/Infectious agents used in conjunction with animals.\nOncogenic viruses used in conjunction with animals.\nInfectious agents requiring handling conditions above Biosafety Level-1. (Biosafety Level determinations are based on the recommendations outlined by the CDC-NIH publication\u00a0Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories.)\nRecombinant DNA.\n\t\tDefinitions For Clarification\nRecombinant DNA (rDNA) molecules are defined as either: (i) molecules that are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or (ii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) above.\nNucleic acids that are not and cannot be replicated inside organisms, cells, or viruses are not considered rDNA.\u00a0 Commonly encountered examples of synthetic DNA not considered to be rDNA include Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) products, synthetic oligonucleotides\/primers, and complementary DNA (cDNA) obtained by reverse transcription of RNA.\n\nHuman or non-human primate blood and blood products, human or non-human primate body fluids, and\/or human or non-human primate tissue.\nToxins produced by living organisms (>1 mg of pure toxin, or solutions with concentrations of >1 mg\/ml pure toxin). This provision excludes toxins covered by the Select Agent regulations (see\u00a0#9).\nWhenever a contractual agreement or grant proposal requires Institutional Biosafety Committee approval for the safe handling of a biological or chemical product.\nHHS and USDA Select Agents and Toxins, as defined in Federal Regulations 7CFR331, 9CFR121, and 42CRF73, Additional Requirements for Facilities Transferring or Receiving Select Agents, Public Law 107-188, Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act.

When it is unclear as to whether a material constitutes a potential biohazard, the IBC should be consulted. Questions should be directed to ORP or to Environmental Health and Safety at 6 Eisenhower Parking Deck.\nIBC--the Institutional Biosafety Committee -\nA Committee appointed by the Vice President for Research to review and approve the use of regulated\/biohazardous materials in research. The membership of this Committee includes Penn State faculty and staff with expertise in relevant areas. In addition, at least two members of the local community are appointed to the committee to represent local concerns. Membership of this Committee is consistent with federal regulations on the review of projects involving the use of recombinant DNA.\nREQUESTS FOR BIOHAZARDS REVIEWS:\nIBC submission forms can be obtained from the ORP web site.\u00a0 Completed forms should be returned via email to ORP-Biosafety@psu.edu. The Principal Investigator is responsible to provide sufficient information to allow the IBC to determine if this work can be conducted safely and appropriately.\nA written safety protocol will be required for projects that involve regulated\/biohazardous materials used in conjunction with animals, for project using Select Agents, for projects involving USDA Restricted Plant Pathogens, and forany project conducted at Biosafety Level 3 or higher. The safety protocol will require signatures from the Biosafety Officer and the appropriate facility manager.\nAPPROVAL PROCEDURE:\nThe IBC consists of the following subcommittees:\nRecombinant DNA\nPathogens and Oncogenes\nCarcinogens and Toxins\nEach IBC submission received by ORP will be processed and reviewed in accordance with the process outlined in the Biosafety Committee Charter maintained by the ORP on behalf of the IBC. The PI will be responsible for responding to any requests for additional information in a timely manner.\nOnce IBC approval is granted, it is the responsibility of the PI to ensure that approval letters are properly directed to any funding agency or sponsor.\nCOMPLIANCE:\nThe IBC has express authority (1) to monitor research covered by approval letters it has issued; and (2) to enforce biosafety requirements,including the suspension of research, or recommending to the Vice President for Research penalties and sanctions for non-complaint investigators. The IBC, through the ORP, shall report such noncompliance to EH&S and may request their assistance in implementing sanctions, penalties, and\/or suspensions.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this Manual should also be referenced, especially:\nRP03\u00a0- The Use of Human Participants in Research (Formerly Policy RA14)\nRP04\u00a0- Care and Use of Vertebrate Animals (Formerly Policy RA15)\nSY01\u00a0- Environmental Health and Safety Policy\nSY14\u00a0- Use of Radioactive Materials\nSY20\u00a0- Hazardous Waste Disposal.\nAPPENDIX A:\nUSDA Restricted Animal Pathogens\/Diseases:\n\n\nAfrican horse sickness\nAfrican Swine fever virus*\nAkabane virus\nAvian Influenza virus\nBesnoitia besnoiti\nBluetongue virus*\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy\nBovine infectious patechial fever agent\nBrucella abortus\nBrucellosis melitensis*\nBurkholderia mallei * (Pseudomonas mallei - Glanders)\nCamelpox virus\nClassical Swine fever\nCochliomyia hominivorax (Screwworm)\nCowdria ruminantium (heartwater)\nCreutzfeldt-Jacob Disease variant\nEphemeral fever virus\nFoot and mouth disease virus*\nHistoplasma (Zymonema) farciminosuim\nLouping ill virus\nLumpy skin disease virus\nMycobacterium bovis\nMycoplasma agalactiae\nMycoplasma mycoides (mycoides)\nMycoplasma Capricolum\/M.F38\/M.\nMycoides Carpi (Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia Agent\n\n\nNairobi sheep disease virus (Ganjam virus)\nNewcastle disease virus* (velogenic strains)\nPeste des petits ruminants* (plague of small ruminants)\nRift Valley fever virus*\nRinderpest virus*\nSheep and goat pox*\nSwine vesicular disease virus*\nTeschen disease virus*\nTheileria annulata\nTheileria lawrencei\nTheileria bovis\nTheileria hirci\nTrypanosoma brucei\nTrypanosoma congolense\nTrypanosoma equiperdum (dourine)\nTrypanosoma evansi\nTrypanosoma vivax\nVenezuelan equine encephalomyelitis\nVesicular exanthema virus\nVesicular stomatitis virus\nViral hemorrhagic disease of rabbits\nWesselsbron disease virus\n\n\n*Export license required by Department of Commerce\nEffective Date: December 2, 2016\n\tDate Approved: November 30, 2016\u00a0\u00a0\n\tDate Published: December 2, 2016\nMost Recent Changes:\nDecember 2, 2016 - Edits to PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY, POLICY, REQUESTS FOR BIOHAZARDOUS REVIEWS, APPROVAL PROCEDURE and COMPLIANCE sections; minor clarifications as approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 7, 2018 - Policy moved from SY24 to RP11; Policy Steward changed from Assistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety to\u00a0Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections\nNovember 19, 2015 - Editorial changes in COMPLIANCE section.

The approval of Central matching funds is not automatic.\nResearch assistantship\/traineeship costs that may be included in the calculation of the Central matching funds include stipend, student summer wages, fringe, and tuition.\nRequests for GA funds will be considered only if the Central matching fund contribution exceeds $10,000 annually.\nAn exception will be reviewed when the research assistantship\/traineeship costs are included in a career development\/young investigator proposal or a high profile research proposal\/project as determined by the research dean\/institute director, in consultation with OVPR.\n\nCentral matching funds may be requested up to a maximum of 10 percent of the total research assistantship\/traineeship costs supported by the sponsor [defined in (3)] or 50 percent of the F&A amount with the research assistantship\/traineeship costs included in an externally-sponsored proposal. The PI, in conjunction with the relevant research deans, can choose which mode of matching to follow.\nCollege\/institute\/department matching funds must total an amount equal to or greater than the total GA match requested from Central. The matching funds committed from the colleges\/institutions\/departments must be used to support research assistantships\/traineeships [defined in (3)] associated with the externally-funded project. The central matching form (see link below) must be completed including the research dean's\/institute director's signature, which indicates that the college\/institute\/department matching funds are confirmed.\nThere is no guarantee that an untimely request will be reviewed to meet a proposal deadline. Request forms should be submitted at least one week before the sponsor deadline.\nCentral matching fund commitments expire eighteen months from the date of approval on the approved match form. If after eighteen months, the match is still needed, a new match form should be submitted to\u00a0centralmatch@psu.edu.\nCENTRAL MATCHING FUNDS EXAMPLE:\nAn investigator is applying for a graduate training grant and includes 8 students on the sponsor's budget. The sponsor costs for 8 students are equal to $288,000 and the F&A related to those costs are $144,000 (round numbers are used in these examples for demonstration purposes and do not precisely reflect actual costs).\nMatch using 50% of GA Costs with F&A\nSponsor GA Costs (w\/o F&A)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$ 288,000\n\u00a0\nSponsor F&A on GA Costs\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$ 144,000\n[50% = $72,000]\nUniversity Match:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Central (50% of F&A on GA Costs\n$ 72,000\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0College\n$ 36,000\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Institute\n$ 18,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Department\n$ 18,000\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal University Match\n\u00a0\n$ 144,000\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal Amount to support students\n\u00a0\n$\u00a0432,000\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\t\tMatch using 10% of GA Costs without F&A\nSponsor GA Costs (w\/o F&A)\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$ 288,000\n[10% = $28,800]\nSponsor F&A on GA Costs\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$ 144,000\n\u00a0\nUniversity Match:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Central (50% of F&A on GA Costs\n$ 28,800\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0College\n$ 14,400\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Institute\n$ 7,200\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Department\n$ 7,200\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal University Match\n\u00a0\n$ 57,600\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal Amount to support students\n\u00a0\n$\u00a0345,600\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAPPROVAL PROCEDURES:\nRequests for Central matching funds must be approved by the research dean or institute director and submitted to\u00a0centralmatch@psu.edu\u00a0using the appropriate Central matching funds request form.

The approved Central matching funds request form will also be sent to the relevant Central staff.\nACCESS TO MATCHING FUNDS:\nIf a proposal is awarded, the relevant research office must send a copy of the award letter\/notice to OVPR at\u00a0centralmatch@psu.edu. Relevant financial officers should also be notified that matching funds will be forthcoming from Central. OVPR will contact the Provost's office for the release of funds.\nIf a proposal is awarded with a revised budget from the sponsor\/agency that decreases the research assistantship\/traineeship support, the amount of Central matching funds must be recalculated to comply with the above guidelines and resubmitted to\u00a0centralmatch@psu.edu.\nIf a proposal is not awarded, the relevant research office must send an e-mail to\u00a0centralmatch@psu.edu\u00a0indicating that the matching funds may be released.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nRAG51 - Central Matching Funds Program for Research Equipment\nEffective Date: February 26, 2016\n\tDate Approved: February 22, 2016\n\tDate Published: February 26, 2016\nMost recent changes:\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new guideline (incorporating old RAG03 and RAG21) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nApril 27, 2011 - New Policy Guideline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"This program is intended to lead to more competitive research proposals and to increase the number of externally-funded University research assistantships\/traineeships by making Central matching funds available for support of research assistantships\/traineeships as proposed in an externally-funded research project."},{"university":"psu","name":"ac82","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity-Named Chairs | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesUniversity-Named Chairs \n\n\n\nAcademic Policies\n\nAC82\nUniversity-Named Chairs                (Formerly  HR82)\n\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nVice Provost for Faculty Affairs>\n\u00a0\nPOLICY'S INITIAL DATE: October 1, 1974\n\tTHIS VERSION EFFECTIVE: July 27, 2006\nPurpose\nDesignated Titles\nPurpose of Appointment\nQualifications and Length of Appointment\nResponsibility for Appointment\nSource of Funds\nEarly Activation\nTitle Continuation Into Emeritus Rank\nCross Reference\n\n\nDESIGNATED TITLES:\nThe designated title is ( name of benefactor ), University Chair in ( field ).\nPURPOSE OF APPOINTMENT:\nTo provide distinguished scholars the opportunity to continue and further the scholar's contributions to teaching, research, and public service through the provision of salary and supplementary funds. The supplementary funds are to be used for, but are not restricted to, such areas as graduate assistant stipends, secretarial assistance, course development, and travel expenses. In addition, the University-named chair evidences the benefactor's long-term commitment to the support of scholarly activity within the context of the University.\nQUALIFICATIONS AND LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT:\nThe holder shall be a full-time member of the University faculty with the academic rank of professor, senior scientist, or librarian. The term of the appointment shall be determined by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University upon recommendation of the dean of the appropriate college, consistent with the conditions of the grant.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR APPOINTMENT:\nAppointments will be made by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University upon recommendation of the dean of the appropriate college.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS:\nFunds will be provided by gifts or designated University funds appropriate for this purpose. The establishment of a named chair requires an endowment of not less than $2,000,000, the income from which will provide salary as well as the aforementioned support services to the holder of the chair, and will maintain the chair in perpetuity.\nEARLY ACTIVATION:\nIn certain cases, the agreement reached with a major donor regarding the support of an endowed chair may specify that the University will not receive the endowment funding for several years. So that the donor may begin seeing the results of the gift at an earlier time, consideration will be given to the possibility of immediately activating the chair.\nProposals for the early establishment of endowed chairs will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. The following general guidelines will apply:\nThe agreement reached with the donor must be of an irrevocable nature -- charitable remainder trust, charitable gift annuity, estate note, etc.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where approval has been received, the donor must commit through a multi-year pledge of 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year until the endowment income becomes available. A term of at least five years is preferred.\n\t\t\u00a0\nActivation of an endowed chair through annual gifts will require that all parties be informed that funding of the chair will continue as long as resources are available.\nTITLE CONTINUATION INTO EMERITUS RANK:\nAn individual eligible for emeritus rank holding a University-Named Title will continue such title designation.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual may also apply, especially;\nFN03 - Substantiation, Disclosure, and Accountability for the Receipt of Contributions from Non-Governmental Sources, and the related Guideline,\nFNG01 - Flow and Accountability of Gifts and Grants from Non-Governmental Sources.\n(Revised endowment minimum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the University's policy on University-named chairs."},{"university":"psu","name":"bs17","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse and Procurement of External Consultants | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesUse and Procurement of External Consultants \n\n\n\nBusiness Services Policies\n\nBS17\nUse and Procurement of External Consultants\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssociate Vice President for Auxiliary & Business Services>\nContents:\nPurpose\nPolicy\nProcurement Authority\nDefinitions\nGeneral Restrictions\nGeneral Requirements\nInformal Contact With Potential Consultants\nCompetitive Buying\nNon-Competitive Buying\nInitiation of Procurement Process\nAllowable Costs\nUnallowable Costs\nExecution of Consulting Agreement and Purchase Order\nPayments\nProcedures\n\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of the University to utilize Consultants in a legitimate and economical way in order to obtain specialized expert and professional opinion or advice in the course of attempting to improve the quality of services and operations of the University, fulfilling its mission of teaching, research, and service.

(See \"Definitions,\" below.) Nor shall such procurement be used to circumvent the normal hiring and promotion procedures of the University.\nIt is the intention of the University that: the hiring of a Consultant be in the best interest of the University; that Consultants are selected and procured in a proper manner; that Consultants have provided the services for which they are paid; and that dealings with Consultants follow sound business practices and are able to be readily audited. The procurement, scope of activity, and subsequent payment of Consultants as indicated above shall be governed by this policy. Additional stipulations that appear in the preprinted terms of the Consulting Agreement that do not explicitly appear in this Policy shall be considered to be a part of the University's consulting policy.\nThe use of Consultants shall be compliant with the provisions of Federal Office of Management and Budget Circular 2 CFR Part 200 - Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, also referred to as \"the Uniform Guidance.\" Compensation to Consultants shall be compliant with Internal Revenue Service regulations.\nPROCUREMENT AUTHORITY:\nPolicy BS07 specifies the University's policy regarding the negotiation and procurement of equipment, materials, goods and services, including consulting.

If travel expenses are specified in the Consulting Agreement, then reimbursable amounts must be for allowable actual expenses and\/or per diem amounts and not exceedthe dollar limitations of University travel policies. If the Consultant is procured as part of Sponsored Award, then reimbursable amounts must be per the dollar limitations of Penn State travel policies, and be specified in the Consulting Agreement. In some cases it may be deemed necessary to agree to reimburse travel expenses in excess of University policy limitations. This is permissible if it is reasonable, is in the best interest of the University, and has the prior written approval of the Corporate Controller (or theAssociate Vice President for Health Finance and Controller for issues at theMedical Center), as an exception to policy.\nOther expenses may be specified in the Consulting Agreement as a separate reimbursable item beyond the rate of compensation.These might include other costs to be incurred by the Consultant in fulfillment of the terms of the Consulting Agreement.

Hershey Medical Center (HMC).\nThe University and HMC designated the University\u2019s College of Medicine (COM) and HMC as an affiliated covered entity (ACE) for purposes of implementation of and compliance with obligations of the Privacy Rule and Security Rule. The Privacy Officer appointed by HMC shall by such appointment serve as the Privacy Officer on behalf of COM. The ACE agreement authorizes disclosure of protected health information by and between HMC and COM for purposes of treatment, payment and operations, and for purposes of research.\nIRB Office:\u00a0 For all campuses and colleges, except the College of Medicine (COM) and The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center (HMC): Office for Research Protections (ORP)\nFor Penn State College of Medicine (COM) and The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center (HMC):\u00a0 Human Subjects Protection Office (HSPO)\nRESEARCH AFFECTED BY HIPAA:\nIn general, research utilizing Protected Health Information (\"PHI\") which is obtained from (a) health care providers such as physicians and hospitals or (b) health plans, will be subject to HIPAA rules applicable to obtaining, using and protecting such information. \"PHI\" is individually identifiable health information created, obtained or maintained by a health care provider or by a health plan covered by HIPAA. A \"health plan\" is a plan that pays the cost of health care expenses.\nWithin the University and HMC, this means that research will be subject to HIPAA rules if: (a) it uses PHI obtained or maintained by any of the administrative units identified in Policy AD22; (b) it uses PHI obtained or maintained by the hospital and providers of The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center; or (c) it uses PHI created by a Penn State or Milton S. Hershey Medical Center researcher while in the course of providing health care to an individual. In addition, at HMC and COM, research will also be subject to HIPAA rules if it uses PHI collected by a health care provider of HMC even if collected only for research purposes.\nUniversity and HMC researchers will also be subject to HIPAA rules if the research seeks to use PHI obtained from health care providers, such as physicians, hospitals and nursing homes that are not affiliated with the University or HMC or from health plans. In that case, use of PHI will be governed by this policy as well as any HIPAA policies of such other health care providers or health plans.\nNot all individually identifiable health information is subject to HIPAA rules. Research that involves health information that is not obtained by or from a health care provider or a health plan subject to HIPAA, also known as a covered entity, is not subject to HIPAA. Although not in scope of HIPAA, identifiable health information obtained by a non-HIPAA-covered researcher is still deserving of the same standard of protection as PHI, and these standards must be implemented by any PSU or HMC workforce member involved in human subjects research using individually identifiable health information.\nREVIEW OF PROTOCOLS FOR HIPAA COMPLIANCE:\nAll research studies involving human subjects must be submitted to the Office for Research Protections (ORP), or the Human Subjects Protection Office (HSPO) in CATS IRB (irb.psu.edu) for review and a determination whether the protocol will be subject to HIPAA rules governing disclosure and use of PHI. If it is determined that the protocol is subject to HIPAA rules, the terms of this policy will apply to that study.\nPOLICY:\nIn order to utilize PHI in connection with research, researchers must (a) obtain written authorization from the individual who is participating as a research subject in accordance with HIPAA standards for authorization, (b) obtain a waiver of the authorization requirement from the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with HIPAA standards for such waivers, or (c) submit requests for approval to use PHI for activities preparatory to research or to use the PHI of decedents in research.\nPHI obtained in accordance with this policy may be used only by and disclosed only to the principal investigator and other members of the research team, except that further disclosure may be made (a) as specified in the authorization granted by the individual from or about whom PHI has been obtained as set forth in this policy, or (b) as required or permitted by the HIPAA rules or other law. Approval of the appropriate Privacy Officer is required for any disclosure request that is not within the scope of an authorization granted by the individual participating in research or as required or permitted by HIPAA rules and other law.\nUTILIZATION OF PHI IN RESEARCH BY AUTHORIZATION:\nIf an authorization is required in order to utilize PHI in connection with research, the content of the authorization must comply with HIPAA rules.\nAuthorization may be obtained by the use of a separate authorization form, which is reviewed with and signed by the individual participating in the research protocol. A template authorization form is available in CATS IRB (irb.psu.edu) and should be completed by the principal investigator and submitted with the CATS IRB (irb.psu.edu) submission for review by the IRB.\nAuthorization may also be obtained by including the requisite information in an Informed Consent Form to be used for the study. Model provisions for inclusion of an authorization with the Informed Consent Form are available in CATS IRB (irb.psu.edu). The IRB will review the authorization provisions as part of its review of the Informed Consent Form.\nCopies of the authorization, whether separate from or included in the Informed Consent Form, \u00a0signed by the individual participating in the research protocol must be retained by the principal investigator for a minimum of six years after the completion of the research.\nIn the event a principal investigator leaves the University or HMC prior to the end of the six-year requirement, the investigator will contact the appropriate IRB office and make arrangements for ongoing retention of required research documents at the University or HMC.\nUTILIZATION OF PHI IN RESEARCH WITH A WAIVER OF AUTHORIZATION:\nIf a research protocol proposes to obtain and use PHI in research without an authorization, the principal investigator must submit a request for a waiver of authorization to the appropriate IRB office. The request for a waiver of the authorization must be included in the protocol provided in the CATS IRB (irb.psu.edu) submission.\u00a0 The request for a waiver of authorization will then be reviewed by the appropriate IRB.\nApproval of a waiver of authorization by the COM IRB is necessary in order to obtain access to PHI maintained by the Hospital and providers of The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.\nApproval of a waiver of authorization by the Penn State IRB is necessary in order to obtain access to PHI maintained by all administrative units identified in Penn State Policy AD22.\nIn order to obtain access to PHI maintained by any other health care provider based upon a waiver of authorization, approval of the Penn State or COM IRB will be required. In addition, depending upon the policies of such other health care providers, it may be necessary to obtain approval of the waiver from another IRB or privacy board.\nAn application for waiver will be approved only if the IRB concludes that the criteria in the HIPAA rules have been satisfied. These include:\nThe use or disclosure of PHI involves no more than a minimal risk to the privacy of individuals, based on, at least, the presence of the following elements:an adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure;\nan adequate plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the research, unless there is a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or such retention is otherwise required by law; and\nadequate written assurances that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by law, for authorized oversight of the research project, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration; and\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.\nREVIEWS PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH:\nBecause it may be necessary for a researcher to obtain access to and review PHI in order to prepare a research protocol, HIPAA rules allow such review upon compliance with specified criteria. This provision might be used, for example, to design a research study or to assess the feasibility of conducting a study, or to identify potential subjects for a study. A request for review of PHI preparatory to research must be submitted to the IRB Office, and approved by the IRB. Request forms are available on the respective IRB Office websites: http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/orp\/humans and http:\/\/www.pennstatehershey.org\/web\/irb\/home.\nThe IRB may only approve such requests if the researcher provides the following representations in the request form:\nThe use or disclosure of the protected health information is solely to prepare a research protocol or for similar purposes preparatory to research;\nNo PHI will be removed in any manner, including by means of copying or notes, from the original source of the PHI, to include patient records of The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center; and\nThe PHI for which access is sought is necessary for the research purpose.\nPHI OF DECEDENTS:\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule protects the PHI of persons who have died.\u00a0 Because it may be necessary for a researcher to obtain access to and review the PHI of decedents, HIPAA rules allow such review upon compliance with specified criteria. A request for the use of a decedent\u2019s PHI for purposes of research must be submitted to the IRB office and approved by the IRB prior to engaging in research with the PHI of decedents. Request forms are available on the respective IRB office websites: http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/orp\/humans and http:\/\/www.pennstatehershey.org\/web\/irb\/home\nThe IRB may only approve such requests if the researcher provides the following representations in the request form:\nThe use or disclosure is sought solely for research on the PHI of decedents.\nThe PHI for which use or disclosure is sought is necessary for the purposes of the proposed research.\nAt the request of the covered entity, documentation of the death of the individuals whose PHI is sought by the researchers will be provided.\nACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES OF PHI:\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule permits individuals to obtain a record of certain disclosures of their PHI by covered entities or their business associates, including certain disclosures made by researchers who must comply with the Rule. Upon receiving an individual's request, a covered entity must account for disclosures of that individual's PHI made during the six years prior to the request, unless a particular disclosure or type of disclosure is excluded from this accounting requirement in Section 164.528(a) of the Privacy Rule. For example, an accounting is not needed when the PHI disclosure is made: (1) For treatment, payment, or health care operations; (2) Under an authorization for the disclosure; (3) To an individual about himself or herself; or (4) As part of a limited data set under a data use agreement.\u00a0 For purposes of this policy, \u201cdisclosure\u201d means the release, transfer or divulging of information in any other manner outside the entity holding the information.\nStandard accounting includes, for each disclosure, the following information:\nDate of disclosure;\nName and address, if known, of person\/entity that received the PHI;\nDescription of what PHI was disclosed; and\nBrief statement regarding the purpose of the disclosure.\nMultiple disclosures accounting is permissible if multiple disclosures of PHI have been made to the same person or entity for a single purpose under Sections 164.502(a)(2)(ii) or 164.512 of the Privacy Rule. For each disclosure, the following must be included:\nThe date of the initial disclosure was made during the accounting period.\nThe name and, if know, address of the person or entity receiving the PHI.\nA brief description of the PHI disclosed.\nA brief statement of the reason for the disclosure.\nThe frequency, periodicity, or number of the disclosures made during the accounting period.\nThe date of the last such disclosure during the accounting period.\nThe date of the last disclosure must be documented.\nLarge Studies with Waiver: HIPAA rules allow a modified tracking method for research that involves the disclosure of PHI from more than 50 people and for which authorization has been waived. In this instance it is unnecessary to maintain a list of the specific persons about whom PHI has been disclosed, but the following information must be available upon the request of any individual whose information may have been included.\nThe name of the protocol or research activity;\nA plain-language description of the research protocol or activity, purpose of the research, and criteria for selecting particular records;\nBrief descriptions of types of PHI disclosed;\nDates or time periods during which disclosures occurred, including the date of the last disclosure during the accounting period;\nContact information (name, address, telephone number) for sponsors and recipient researchers; and\nStatement that a specific individual's PHI may or may not have been disclosed for a particular protocol or research activity.\nIn addition, the researcher must also assist in contacting the sponsor and recipient researcher if it is reasonably likely that an individual's PHI was disclosed to them.\nThe principal investigator must maintain all accounting of disclosure information for no less than six years. The information must be made available to the appropriate Privacy Office as needed.\nREVOCATION OF AUTHORIZATION BY SUBJECT:\nHIPAA rules allow a subject to revoke a prior authorization to use or disclose PHI for purposes of research. Subjects\u2019 requests for the revocation of authorization must be requested in writing to the principal investigator. Researchers must honor this request, except to the extent the researcher has already relied on the authorization. Researchers may continue utilizing PHI that was obtained prior to the time the individual revoked his or her authorization, as necessary to maintain the integrity of the research study. In addition, use or disclosure of identifiable information previously obtained is permitted for purposes such as accounting for the subject's withdrawal, reporting adverse events or complying with investigations.\nDATA SECURITY:\nResearchers are responsible for ensuring that data containing PHI or other sensitive data is securely protected from unauthorized disclosures. Researchers must take precautions to securely maintain and dispose of PHI, as described in Policy AD22. (See related policies AD20 and AD23.) Additionally, researchers are responsible for ensuring secure transfer of data containing PHI. When transmitting data containing PHI or other sensitive data electronically, researchers must ensure that 1) appropriate technical safeguards have been implemented, such as secure data encryption; 2) that the receiver of the data is the individual for whom it is intended; and 3) the data remains secure until it is received by the intended receiver; 4) where an encryption key is used, it is shared with the intended receiver by a separate method from the data transfer. Questions about the security of electronic data transfers may be directed to The Office of Information Security at HIPAA-compliance@psu.edu or the HMC Information Technology Technical Support Center (IT-TSC) at (717) 531-6281.\nWhen sending data containing PHI or other sensitive data via ground mail services, researchers must also assure the security of the information until it arrives in the hands of the intended receiver. Hard copy documents containing PHI or other sensitive data should be sent 1) using an insured carrier; 2) with a receiving signature required; and 3) by a carrier with package tracking services. When sending PHI or other sensitive data stored on electronic media (i.e. USB flash drives, memory cards, DVDs, CDs), appropriate technical safeguards must be implemented, such as data encryption.\u00a0\u00a0 If the principal investigator or designee is unsure whether appropriate technical safeguards are in place, he or she must engage the assistance of the IT-TSC by calling 717-531-6281.\nRESEARCH COMMENCED PRIOR TO APRIL 14, 2003:\nAn authorization is not required under the HIPAA rule for subjects who were enrolled in a research protocol before April 14, 2003 and who have signed a Common Rule-compliant informed consent form. Even if subjects enrolled before April 14, 2003 continue in the research after that date, authorization will not be required.\nAn authorization will be required for any subject enrolled in a study on or after April 14, 2003, even if the study was approved by the IRB prior to that date. Therefore, if all subjects were enrolled prior to April 14, 2003, there is no need for an authorization for those subjects. However, authorization will be required for any new subjects after April 14, 2003, either in the form of a separate authorization document or a modified informed consent form, which includes the required authorization language.\nWAIVER OF CONSENT REQUIREMENT BY IRB PRIOR TO APRIL 14, 2003 GRANDFATHERED:\nIf researchers are conducting a study under an IRB-approved waiver of consent obtained prior to April 14, 2003, they should continue protecting the privacy of subjects' information, but do not need to re-apply to the IRB. Ongoing studies for which the IRB approved a waiver of informed consent before April 14, 2003 are grandfathered under the HIPAA Privacy rule. Although a new waiver is not required, it is important to note that the individual rights provided by the Privacy Rule go into effect as of April 14, 2003. As a result, any disclosure of PHI made pursuant to a waiver of authorization must be tracked as noted above.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President for Research, Director of the Office for Research Protections.\n CROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may have specific application and should be referred to, especially;\nAD20 - Computer and Network Security,\nAD22 - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nAD23 - Use of Institutional Data\nEffective Date: January 13, 2017\n\tDate Approved: January 13, 2017\n\tDate Published: January 13, 2017\nMost recent changes:\nJanuary 13, 2017 - This policy combines and replaces the former RP07 (for PSU) and RP08 (for Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine) with a single policy.\u00a0\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 8, 2015 - This policy was previously a Research Administration policy, Policy RA22.

The University reserves the right to cancel, postpone, or alter arrangements for any event if necessary.\nAIMS AND PURPOSES:\nThe use of facilities must be for purposes which do not conflict with the general aims and purposes of University regulations or local, state and federal laws. Approval to use facilities does not necessarily imply approval of the aims and purposes of the sponsoring organization nor the event being planned.\nNON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES:\nThe use of the facility must be for noncommercial purposes. (See Policy AD27.)\nFUND RAISING:\nExcept as set forth below, the use of facilities shall not have as its purpose the raising of funds for activities or causes unrelated to the University.\nIf any fund raising activity takes place, a detailed plan for the designation of funds must be specifically approved by the appropriate budget executive at the respective University location. No funds can be distributed to any organization or individual other than a tax-exempt organization.\nAt the University Park campus:\nThe use of facilities for fund raising shall be limited to those facilities which have approved rental rates (e.g., golf courses, indoor tennis courts, ice skating rink, etc.).\n\t\t\u00a0\nOther recreational facilities intended for academic instruction, intramural or intercollegiate athletic programs, or individual recreational programs, will not be used for fund raising purposes.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFund raising activities must be conducted in conjunction with, or co-sponsored by, an organized student group, University college, department or administrative unit. Co-sponsorship must be by a bona fide parallel-interest organization with equal participation in the planning and implementation of the activity.\nAt Non-University Park Locations:\nApproved use of facilities by non-University groups for the purposes of fund raising may or may not be restricted to co-sponsorship by an authorized University group.\nUSE OF THE UNIVERSITY NAME:\nAny use of the name of the University, other than to indicate the location of the event, must be approved in advance by the University through the Office of the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business\/Treasurer (per Policy AD07).\nPROVISION OF FOOD:\nThe provision of food and beverages by other than the authorized University agent operating or contracting for food and beverage services is specifically prohibited. (Refer to Policy AD26.)\nPOSTING OF MATERIAL:\nIndividuals and groups may post commercial and noncommercial announcements on the University's general purpose bulletin boards. As appropriate, related noncommercial announcements may be posted on specific purpose bulletin boards. (General purpose boards and specific purpose boards will be specifically labeled.)\nExcept as permitted herein, no poster, handbill, or any form of announcement or statement can be placed on, attached to, or written on any structure or natural feature of the campus such as doors, buildings, windows, the surface of walkways, roads, fountains, posts, waste receptacles, trees or stakes, or posted on motor vehicles.\nFINANCIAL ACTIVITIES:\nInformation must be provided in advance to the University concerning any financial activities or transactions planned by the non-University group during its use of the facility.\nPAYMENT OR EXPENSES INCURRED:\nThe group will reimburse the University for identifiable increments to the University's operating or overhead expenses imposed by the use of the facility. In addition, the University may charge a fee for the use of its facilities provided that all provisions of Policy AD15 are met.\nPHYSICAL SAFETY AND GENERAL WELFARE:\nThe group using the facilities must agree to take precautions to assure the physical safety of participants and University property, and to release the University from any liability in conjunction with the use of the facility. A University Release and Indemnification Agreement must be used for this purpose. (See the applicable instructions\u00a0in GURU.) University Release and Indemnification Agreement forms are available in the Department of Community Relations, Office of Strategic Communications at University Park. At all other locations, they are available in the office of the campus executive officer or dean\/provost.\nA copy of the completed University Release and Indemnification Agreement must be forwarded to the Risk Management Office at University Park.\nThe University reserves the right to require insurance coverage and may require the presence of University Safety personnel for any group requesting to use University facilities. (See Administrative Guideline ADG04.)\nPROCEDURE FOR REQUESTING APPROVAL:\nNon-University groups wishing to use the University Park facilities (except The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, and the Bryce Jordan Center) within the above policy (or policies AD01 and AD03), shall apply to Strategic Communications. After applications are reviewed by appropriate personnel, including those designated with management or assignment responsibility for specific areas, actions relative to the approval are issued through Department of Community Relations.\nNOTE: Prior to approval of requests for use of facilities at University Park, Strategic Communications shall check with The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, and the Bryce Jordan Center, to assure that approval for the use of specific facilities requested will not interfere with plans in progress by these entities for the use of those facilities. When approvals are granted, copies of such approvals shall be provided to The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, or the Bryce Jordan Center, as appropriate.\nNon-University groups wishing to use facilities at locations other than University Park within the above policy shall apply to the budget executive at the campus or facility. These applications are acted upon by the budget executive who is responsible for ascertaining the appropriateness of the request within the policy set forth above and for making the final decision concerning the request.\nStrategic Communications (at University Park), and the budget executive (at locations other than University Park), shall keep complete records of the authorized use of facilities by non-University groups. The records will include the name of the group, the purpose of the meeting, the meeting date, the approximate attendance, the cost reimbursement or fee, if any, and the University facilities used.\nSPEECHES, RALLIES, AND DEMONSTRATIONS:\nFor events involving non-University individuals and groups that primarily consist of a speech, rally, or demonstration, please see University Policy AD02A.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of Strategic Communications.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nAD01 - Policies and Procedures for Use of University Auditoriums\nAD02A - Supplemental Policy for Speeches, Rallies, and Demonstrations\nAD03 - Conducting Educational Programs Using the Name of The University\nAD07 - Use of University Name, Symbols and\/or Graphic Devices\nAD15 - Fees and Rates for Facilities and Services\nAD18 - Possession, Use and Distribution of Alcoholic Beverages\nAD26 - Sale and Serving\u00a0of Food and Beverages at University Locations\nAD27 - Commercial Sales Activities at University Locations\nAD51 - Use of Outdoor Areas for Expressive Activities\nADG04 - Providing Emergency Medical Services at University Events at University Park\nMost recent changes:\nApril 20, 2018 - Editorial change to update links to the University Release and Indemnification Agreement instructions and form.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\n\nNovember 10, 2017 - Added new section: Speeches, Rallies, and Demonstrations and link to Policy AD02A.\n\n\nAugust 21, 2014 - Editorial changes.

Some nonregular employees may have re-employment rights upon completion of military service. Individual guidance from the Employee Relations Division should be sought in such instances.\nNOTICE OF LEAVE:\nThe faculty or staff member shall give advance written or oral notice of the active service, unless such notice is precluded by military necessity. Such notice should include, when possible, a copy of the signed orders or authorization mandating the absence.\nPAID LEAVE:\nBy law, all regular faculty and staff who are members of the Pennsylvania National Guard or any reserve component of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard shall be paid for up to fifteen workdays (120 hours) per calendar year while they are engaged in the active service of the United States, including field training.\n\tFifteen additional days (120 hours) of paid time off will be provided if an employee is called to active duty, other than active duty for training or full-time Active Guard Reserve duty, when ordered under 10 U.S.C.- 12301, 12302, 12304, or 32 U.S.C. - 502 (f), for a period of 30 or more consecutive days and assigned to duties away from home, under one or more of the following circumstances:\ninvoluntarily, or\nunder Contingency Operation Temporary Tour of Active Duty (COTTAD), or\nvoluntarily to serve in a combat zone, as designated by an executive order from the president, or\nin response to a domestic emergency.\nBy law, all regular faculty and staff who are members of the Pennsylvania National Guard are entitled to leaves of absence without loss of pay, time, or efficiency rating on all days during which they shall, as members of the Pennsylvania National Guard, be engaged in\u00a0active State duty.\u00a0\n\tDuring the period of time the employee remains on the University payroll, benefits coverages\/deductions and retirement contributions continue.\nUNPAID LEAVE:\nAbsence not covered by provisions contained in the PAID LEAVE section above shall be considered as an unpaid leave of absence, and a leave of absence without salary for active military service shall be granted. Such leave may not exceed an aggregate maximum of sixty calendar months, unless a longer absence is provided by exception by law.\nImmediately prior to commencement of the leave, the employee may elect to use or not use all or part of accumulated vacation, personal holiday, service days, compensatory time off, as applicable, during the leave prior to commencement of no-pay status for the balance of the leave.\nDuring an unpaid leave: \nEligibility for educational privileges and dependent grant-in-aid continues.\nThe employee shall have the option to continue any or all of the benefits listed below in which enrolled for self and\/or eligible dependents by paying the employee cost of such coverages.\n\t\t\u200b\nNote: If an employee wishes to begin enrollment in an available program during the absence, then insurability provisions for such enrollment are applicable.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nUnpaid Leave Benefit Availability\nBenefit\nAvailability for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmployee\nAvailability for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDependents\nLife Insurance\nOptional\nNot Available\nMedical\nOptional\nOptional\nDental\nOptional\nOptional\nVision\nOptional\nOptional\nVoluntary Accidental Death & Dismemberment\nOptional\nOptional\nCoverage in medical, dental, or vision insurances shall not be applicable for an injury\/illness determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have incurred in, or aggravated during, performance of service in the uniformed services.\nThe life insurance policy permits payment of the basic value, but contains a war exclusion for accidental death and dismemberment. The Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment program also excludes coverage for declared or undeclared war or any act thereof.\nExcept for an injury\/illness determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have incurred in, or aggravated during, performance of service in the uniformed services, for employees electing not to continue coverages listed above, pre-existing condition or waiting period requirements for self and\/or eligible dependents shall not be imposed upon return to active employment.\nA military leave of absence will not affect negatively the employee's ability to continue benefits into retirement in accordance with University policy.\n\nEmployer retirement contributions will cease effective with the start of the leave without pay. If upon returning to work, an employee elects to make retirement contributions to cover the period of time absent under this policy, then employer contributions shall also be made to the extent required by law.\nThe period of leave of absence without pay will be added to any length of service credit that a faculty or staff member may have otherwise.\nREPLACING AN EMPLOYEE ON MILITARY LEAVE:\nIf the leave is anticipated to be six months or more and it is necessary to replace the faculty or staff member, the appointment of the new person will be for a period not longer than the duration of the military absence of the original employee. However, during the period of employment, the new person will be considered a regular faculty or staff member and will have the privileges of such, except that he\/she shall not be granted a military leave of absence. The new person must be informed in writing of the conditions of employment when employment begins.\nRETURN TO ACTIVE UNIVERSITY SERVICE:\nUpon release from active military service under honorable conditions, a regular faculty or staff member may return to active service with the University, if he\/she so desires. Insofar as it can be arranged, this return will be to the faculty or staff member's original position or to a position determined by the University to be an equivalent position.\nTo take advantage of this privilege, the faculty or staff member shall notify his\/her immediate supervisor or dean or administrative officer of the return date in advance of the commencement of the leave, if such date is known. If the return date is not known in advance, then the request to return must be presented as soon as practicable, but in no case later than 14 days after the completion of the period of service for a leave of 31 through 180 days in length, or 90 days after the completion of the period of service for a leave longer than 180 days in length. Special conditions on time for requesting return to active employment apply for individuals hospitalized at time of release from military service. In this latter instance, contact the Employee Relations Division of the Office of Human Resources for guidance.\n(To insure that timely consideration can be given with regard to returning the faculty or staff member to employment, it is helpful if the faculty or staff member can indicate his\/her intention to return to active University employment prior to the expiration of the military leave of absence, or if not possible, within thirty calendar days after release from active duty.)\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nHR34 - Employment Conditions For Staff Employees\nUSERRA Handout\nRevisions:\nJuly 26, 2005 - Clarification of Return to Active University Service section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline provisions of leaves of absence with and without pay for short-term and long-term active military service, including military training, whether voluntary or otherwise.\u00a0Note: The law provides similar provisions for those who have extended service in the Public Health Service.

The use of University Mail Service is governed by this general University policy.\nPACKAGE SIZE LIMITATIONS\nBecause of time and space limits on the University Mail Service trucks, the following limits pertain to transferring packages:\n(A) A single package cannot weigh more than 20 pounds.\n(B) A single package cannot exceed 10\" x 15\" x 6.\"\n(C) Only one package exceeding 9\" x 12\" x 1\" can be picked up from any one department per day.\nEXTRAORDINARY PACKAGE SIZE:\nIf packages exceed the above limits, the University Courier Express Services may be called to handle the request. A minimum charge, plus a per package charge, will be made for this service.\nNOTES:\nThis paragraph does not apply to U.S. Parcel Post packages, United Parcel Service (UPS), or Motor Freight shipments.\n\tInterdepartmental Mail envelopes are not considered packages.\nSTANDARD \"A\" NON-PROFIT MAILINGS:\nA Standard \"A\" non-profit mailing must consist of 200 pieces or more of identical mail. The individual piece may be personalized, however, no other variances in the mailing can be accepted. Mailings that are sent out by University departments must be official University business to qualify for the Penn State non-profit rate. Mailings sent out for University related associations will be accommodated if the association has a non-profit permit of their own or if special authorization is requested and approved by the U.S.Postal Service. This is accomplished by filing a 3624 Form through Addressing Services a minimum of 10 days in advance of the mailing date.\nWhen designating a piece to be mailed using the Standard \"A\" non-profit rate, there are several items to be kept in mind. There must be a return address for all Standard \"A\" mail consisting of the following information:\nDepartment Name (as listed in the faculty\/staff directory)\nThe Pennsylvania State University\nRoom Number and Building Name\nCity, State, and Zip Code + 4\nThe use of names, telephone numbers, conference titles, association names, etc. will NOT be permitted in the return address. It will also be necessary to show that any payments due the University involving the conference or seminar are made payable to The Pennsylvania State University and NOT to an association name, conference title, or person's name involved with the program.The Postal Service will be using these two items as a guideline in determining the validity of non-profit mailing for Penn State. The nonprofit indicia, shown below, should also be printed in the upper right hand corner of the pieces being mailed.\nNONPROFIT ORG.U. S. POSTAGE\u00a0PAIDUNIVERSITY PARK PAPERMIT NO. 1\nINTER-OFFICE MAILINGS:\nBecause of the large volumes of inter-office mail handled by our University mail trucks, departments generating campus-wide mailings are required to sort and bundle this mail by building and\/or campus.\nEXCEPTIONAL USE OF MAIL SERVICE:\nAn exception to the general University policy governing the use of University equipment, supplies and services will be considered in the case of the use of University Mail Service where the proposed communication would clearly contribute to the general welfare of the total University community. An example of such an exception is the approval of the annual support of one charitable fund raising activity where fund raising materials may be distributed through University mails. Approval of an exception which falls within this Policy, except in the case of the annual support of one charitable fund raising activity, will be contingent on the agreement by the individual or organization to make payment for the utilization of the mail service according to a schedule of charges maintained in the Office of the Assistant Vice President for Business Services. An exception shall not be granted or may be revoked, if the proposed use\nfails to demonstrate a clear relationship to the welfare of the total University community,\nwill overload the mail delivery system, or\nis intended primarily for personal and private purposes.\nIn the case of an approved exception, priority for handling of mail shall be given to normal University operations.\nREQUESTING AN EXCEPTIONAL USE:\nRequests for an exception to this Policy shall be directed to the Assistant Vice President for Business Services at least 10 days prior to the desired utilization of the University Mail Service. A standing committee will consist of:\nthe chairperson of the Senate Committee on Faculty Affairs,\nvice chairman of the Council of Academic Deans,\nVice President for University Relations,\nVice President for Research, and\nAssistant Vice President for Business Services who also serves as the convener of the committee,\nThis committee shall advise the Senior Vice President for Finance andBusiness on those requests for use of the University Mail Service which require a judgment regarding compliance with this Policy.\nIf the request for an exception is an appeal by a registered student organization to the decision of the Director of Student Life, the president of the Undergraduate Student Government or Graduate Student Association, whichever is most appropriate, shall be added to the committee.\nSTORAGE OF MATERIAL:\nAreas wishing to leave material at Addressing and Mailing Services that will be later used by Addressing Services (e.g., envelopes), will store material for a nominal fee. Material that is not used for more than three months will be returned to the area by Courier Express Service with the storage and delivery fees charged to the owning department's budget.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Associate Vice President, Auxiliary & Business Services.\nEffective Date: March 6, 1998\u00a0\n\tDate Approved: February 25, 1998\u00a0\n\tDate Published: March 11, 1998\u00a0(Editorial changes- October 25, 2013)\nMost Recent Changes:\nOctober 25, 2013 - Editorial changes.

The support monies will be used for such purposes as salary supplementation, graduate assistant stipends, secretarial assistance, and travel expenses, etc. By supporting the establishment of a University-named department head's chair, the benefactor directs attention to a continuing commitment to support scholarship within the University.\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR APPOINTMENT:\nAppointments will be made by the dean of the appropriate college.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS:\nFunds for a University-named department head's chairs are provided by gifts or designated University funds appropriate for this purpose. To establish such a position, an endowment of not less than $3,000,000 is required and the income therefrom, to the extend necessary, shall be used to maintain the department head's chair in perpetuity. Alternatively, a University-named department head's chair may be established for a fixed period of time by an expendable grant of not less than 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year for a minimum of 5 years.\nEARLY ACTIVATION:\nIn certain cases, the agreement reached with a major donor regarding the support of a University-named department head's chair may specify that the University will not receive the endowment funding for several years. So that the donor may begin seeing the results of the gift at an earlier time, consideration will be given to the possibility of immediately activating the chair.\nProposals for the early establishment of University-named department head's chair will be reviewed and approved by the Executive Vice President and Provost of the University. The following general guidelines will apply:\nThe agreement reached with the donor must be of an irrevocable nature -- charitable remainder trust, charitable gift annuity, estate note, etc.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIn cases where approval has been received, the donor must commit through a multi-year pledge of 5 percent of the minimum required endowment per year until the endowment income becomes available. A term of at least five years is preferred.\n\t\t\u00a0\nActivation of a department head's chair annual gifts will required that all parties be informed that funding of the department head's chair will continue as long as resources are available.\nTITLE CONTINUATION INTO EMERITUS RANK:\nAn individual eligible for emeritus rank holding a University-Named Title will continue such title designation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To outline the University's policy on University-named department head's chairs."},{"university":"psu","name":"sy29","policy":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfectious Waste Disposal | Penn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\nSubmit\n \n\nin: \n\nPenn State Policies\nPenn State\nPenn State Directory\nPenn State Departments\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPenn State University\nPenn State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn State Policies\n\n\n\n\n                    Menu                  \n\n\n\n\nHomeAboutUpdatesGURU\n\n\n\nSearch the website\n\nSearch\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nYou are hereHomePolicies and GuidelinesInfectious Waste Disposal \n\n\n\nSafety Policies\n\nSY29\nInfectious Waste Disposal\nPolicy Status:\u00a0\nActive>\n\nPolicy Steward:\u00a0\nAssistant Vice-President for Police and Public Safety \/ Director of Environmental Health and Safety>\nContents:\nPurpose\nReference\nDefinition\nPolicy\nResponsibilities of Persons Who Generate Infectious Waste\nMixed Waste\nStorage Requirements\nResponsibilities of EHS\nDisposal of Infectious Waste at non-University Park Locations\nExamples\nNon-Infectious Waste (University Park)\nFurther Information\nCross References\n\n\nREFERENCE:\nThe University is required by regulation 25 PA Code Chapters 271, 273,283 & 285 of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA-DEP) to ensure the proper handling and disposal of these wastes.\nDEFINITION:\nThe definition of infectious waste contained in the regulations is as follows:\n\"...Municipal and residual waste which is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, immunization or autopsy of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, in the preparation of human or animal remains for interment or cremation, or in the production or testing of biologicals, and which falls under one or more of the following categories:\nCultures and stocks. Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals, including the following: cultures from medical and pathological laboratories; cultures and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories; wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuated vaccines except for residue in emptied containers; and the culture dishes, assemblies and devices used to conduct diagnostic tests or to transfer, inoculate and mix cultures.\nPathological wastes. Human pathological wastes, including tissues, organs, body parts and body fluids that are removed during surgery, autopsy, other medical procedures or laboratory procedures. The term does not include hair, nails or extracted teeth.\nHuman blood and body fluid waste and items contaminated with the same.\nAnimal wastes. Contaminated animal carcasses, body parts, blood, blood products, secretions, excretions and bedding of animals that were known to have been exposed to zoonotic infectious agents or nonzoonotic human pathogens during research (including research in veterinary schools and hospitals), production of biologicals or testing of pharmaceuticals.\nIsolation wastes. Biological wastes and waste contaminated with blood, excretion, exudates or secretions from: A. Humans who are isolated to protect others from highly virulent diseases. B. Isolated animals known or suspected to be infected with highly virulent diseases.\nUsed sharps. Sharps that have been in contact with infectious agents or that have been used in animal or human patient care or treatment, at medical, research or industrial laboratories, including hypodermic needles, syringes (with or without the attached needle), pasteur pipettes, scalpel blades, blood vials, needles with attached tubing, culture dishes, suture needles, slides, cover slips and other broken or unbroken glass or plasticware.\nIn summary, Infectious Waste is any laboratory-generated waste that is or may be contaminated with disease-causing bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other pathogen; OR any item that has been used in recombinant DNA work.\nOrganisms containing recombinant DNA molecules must be rendered incapable of reproduction (preferably by autoclaving) before disposal.\nPOLICY:\nEnvironmental Health and Safety (EHS) is responsible for implementation, enforcement and coordination of the University\u0092s Infectious Waste disposal program at the University Park campus. Directors of Business Services or their designees are responsible for coordination of the program at non-University Park locations.\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF PERSONS WHO GENERATE INFECTIOUS WASTE:\nSegregation of infectious waste from all other types of waste.\nUse of specially labeled red or orange \"biohazard\" bags and puncture resistant \"sharps\" containers for the collection of all infectious waste.Rigid, one-piece polypropylene sharps containers (such as Becton-Dickinson) are preferred; metal cans are not permitted.\nSterilization, by autoclaving, of all infectious waste. Allowable holding times for various infectious waste(s) are as follows:Infectious waste, excluding used sharps, may be stored at room temperature until the storage container is full, but for no longer than 30 days from the date waste was first put in the container.\nA storage container filled with infectious waste may be stored in a refrigeration unit for up to 30 days from the date waste was first placed in the container.\n\u00a0A storage container filled with infectious waste that has been filled within 30 days from the date waste was first placed in the container may be frozen immediately for up to 90 days from the date waste was first placed in the container.\nSharps containers may be used until they are full. e. If the infectious waste becomes putrescent during the allowable storage period, the waste must be moved offsite within 24 hours for processing or disposal.\n\nEnsuring that all treated infectious waste, other than sharps, have been bagged in specially labeled red or orange \"biohazard\" bags. Bags should be purchased from approved vendors to ensure that they are free of heavy metal pigments. Any single bag of waste should weigh less than 20 pounds.\nPlacement of all treated (i.e., autoclaved) infectious waste bags and sharps containers into specially labeled infectious waste receptacles provided by EHS at University Park. At non-University Park locations, the campus is responsible for waste receptacles; the vendor will provide boxes for final packaging of infectious waste.\nMIXED WASTE:\nInfectious waste that is mixed with radioactive waste or chemical waste requires special handling. Liquid infectious waste that contains radioactive material must be rendered biologically inactive before the Radiation Protection Office will accept it. This can be done by autoclaving or adding sufficient household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) to make up 10% of the total volume (i.e., 100 ml of bleach for each liter of liquid waste). Solid infectious waste containing radioactive material must be autoclaved prior to disposal.\nMixed infectious and chemical waste must also be rendered biologically inactive before disposal as hazardous chemical waste unless the generator can ensure that a denaturing environment exists in the chemical waste. Chemical compatibility must also be taken into account before adding bleach or any other chemical disinfectant.\nSTORAGE REQUIREMENTS:\nInfectious waste be stored in a manner that:\nMaintains the integrity of the containers, prevents the leakage or release of waste from the containers, and provides protection from water, rain and wind.\nPrevents the spread of infectious agents.\nMaintains the waste in a nonputrescent state.\nStorage containers must be:\nLeakproof\nImpervious to moisture\nSufficient in strength to prevent puncturing, tearing or bursting during storage.\nSharps containers, in addition to the criteria listed above, must be:\nRigid\nTightly lidded\nPuncture resistant\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF EHS\nEnvironmental Health and Safety will be responsible for the collection of waste receptacles, transportation of these materials, and for arranging for final disposal. EHS uses approved methods for the disposal of infectious waste. EHS is also responsible for implementation and enforcement of this policy.Normal infectious waste disposal costs are funded through EHS.\nDISPOSAL OF INFECTIOUS WASTE AT NON-UNIVERSITY PARK LOCATIONS:\nCollection and storage procedures for infectious waste are the same as at University Park. EH&S retains a licensed infectious waste transportation and disposal vendor to provide services for all University facilities. In general, this service is provided to the Campuses up to four times per year at no cost. Animal carcasses used for teaching purposes will also be disposed of through this vendor. Materials should be packaged as per procedures established by EHS and the vendor.\nEXAMPLES:\nAgar - All agar plates with any microbial growth should be autoclaved, allowed to cool and resolidify, and then be disposed of in the white barrels.\nLiquids - All tissue culture media and broth cultures should be autoclaved and poured down the drain when cool. Alternatively, sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) may be used. A sufficient amount of bleach should be added to bring the final concentration to 10% of the total volume(i.e., 10 mls bleach to 100 mls aqueous waste). The mixture is then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then may be poured down the drain.\nSolids - Other laboratory waste such as plastic and glass pipettes, petri dishes (both plastic and glass), multiwell plates, tissue culture flasks, cuvettes, gloves and pipette tips should be collected in a biohazard bag, autoclaved, and placed into the white infectious waste barrels. All infectious waste must be contained in a biohazard bag before being placed into the infectious waste barrels. Loose items will not be accepted!\nSharps - ALL sharps (i.e., hypodermic needles, syringes, razor and scalpel blades) should be disposed of in a puncture-resistant sharps container. In addition to these items, all pasteur pipettes, broken glass and microscope slides which have been in contact with viable infectious materials should be disposed of in a sharps container, which should be autoclaved before disposal.\nGels - Polyacrylamide and agarose gels, including those stained with ethidium bromide should be placed into biohazard bags and put directly into the infectious waste barrel. They need not be autoclaved.\nNON-INFECTIOUS WASTE (UNIVERSITY PARK):\nALL plastic and glass labware, pipettes, pipette tips and gloves which have been used to transfer salt solutions, buffers and other non-infectious materials should be placed into the maroon \"Disposable Lab Glass\" cans distributed by the Office of Physical Plant. These items are not to be placed into biohazard bags. These cans are merely an alternative method for janitorial personnel to transport materials to the dumpster.\nAt the University Park campus, animal carcasses are disposed of through the Animal Resource Program, 865-1495.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Director of Environmental Health and Safety.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies in this manual should also be referenced, especially the following:\nSY01 -Environmental Health and Safety Policy\nSY20 - Hazardous Waste Disposal\nRP11 - Use of Biohazardous Materials in Research and Instruction\nEffective Date: May 17, 2000\n\tDate Approved: May 17, 2000\n\tDate Published: May 19, 2000 (Editorial changes- March 23, 2016)\nMost Recent Changes:\nJune 26, 2018 - Editorial changes.\u00a0 In CROSS REFERENCES, updated\u00a0link to Policy RP11,\u00a0Use of Biohazardous Materials in Research and Instruction.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nJune 20, 2018 - Editorial changes.\u00a0 Modified definition section to include organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules.\nMarch 23, 2016 - Editorial changes.

Academic units wishing to offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs off-campus through Distance Education\/World Campus will seek academic approval to offer the program at a new location. If the program involves the development of new credit courses, these will be approved by the Faculty Senate per existing University policy.\nAll academic units of the University may propose programs for delivery through Distance Education\/World Campus. The academic unit is responsible for gaining appropriate academic approval for the program for distance education delivery. Academic units are responsible for assigning faculty to the program, for academic quality, for certifying degrees, and other academic responsibilities.\nAs appropriate, Distance Education\/World Campus will provide support services, such as instructional design and technology support, faculty development, marketing and promotion, and registration, records, and related student support and will ensure that programs conducted in the name of the University through distance education comply with the policies and procedures established by the University.\nDistance Education\/World Campus will fund costs and will collect all tuition and fees for off-campus students, sharing net income with the sponsoring academic unit through University policies existing at the time of delivery.\nThe following criteria will be used to evaluate approval of programs for delivery through Distance Education\/World Campus: academic strength of the program as certified by the sponsoring college; readiness of faculty to commit to course development and delivery; appropriateness of the program for delivery through available technologies; evidence of the existence of an identifiable, reachable market that can sustain costs over the proposed life of the program;and the ability of the program to achieve and support students at a scale of operation needed to recover full costs and anticipated net income.\nDegree programs delivered via Distance Education\/World Campus will be monitored by the Faculty Senate and\/or the Graduate Council.\nADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY:\nThe Vice President for Outreach and Cooperative Extension, in conjunction with the Dean of the sponsoring college or school, will have overall responsibility for ensuring the effective delivery of all approved programs offered through the Department of Distance Education\/World Campus. The Associate Vice President for Distance Education and Executive Director of the World Campus, in conjunction with the Associate Dean for Outreach of the school or college, will have general administrative responsibility for the operation and delivery of all approved programs and will establish budgets and arrange for faculty and student support as appropriate to the individual program.\nMost recent changes:\nJune 15, 2006 - Revision History added.\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nDeptember 7, 2000 - New Policy.\nDate Approved:\u00a0\nSeptember 5, 2000>\nDate Published:\u00a0\nSeptember 7, 2000>\nEffective Date:\u00a0\nSeptember 7, 2000>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"The Department of Distance Education was created to provide a single University-wide administrative unit to support academic units in the delivery of courses and programs that use technology as the primary delivery method to serve off-campus students.

Modification of the end date can only be done with approval of the sponsor. Requests for extensions must be processed through Office of Sponsored Programs via the College Research Office. Research Accounting will revise the end date following receipt of agency approval from Sponsored Programs.\nHold-Close Date: The hold-close date is the last day on which allowable expenditures can be posted to the account. The hold-close date will be automatically set by the system at 45 calendar days after the end date of the award. Research Accounting will be the only office authorized to change the hold-close date. In the case of subawards, subcontracts, and publications and printing costs, adjustments to the hold-close date may be authorized to allow posting of these expenditures beyond the 45-day hold-close date.\nNote: If the sponsor requires the final invoice in less than the standard 90 days, Research Accounting will set the hold-close date at less than 45 days after the end date. For example, if the final invoice is due in 60 days, the hold-code date will be set at 30 days after the end date.\n\nExpense-Close Date: The expense-close date will be automatically set by the system as 90 calendar days after the end date of the award. Only Research Accounting has the authority to change the expense-close date. Between the period of the hold-close date and expense-close date, the system will only allow postings to expenditures for journal vouchers approved by Research Accounting, credit adjustments, and fringe\/overhead calculations.\nIncome-Close Date (Account Close Date): This will be the date when final income is received and Research Accounting does the final close on the account. Both income and budget details may be posted between the expense-close date and the income-close date. This date will be controlled and set by Research Accounting.\nRESPONSIBILITIES:\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): Responsible for checking the award document for all pertinent details about closeout procedures and dates as well as for performing a full review of costs, including effort, to ensure all costs are reasonable, allowable and allocable. The PI is also responsible for preparing and submitting technical reports as well as patent reports, if applicable.\nDepartment: Responsible for assisting the PI as appropriate with award closing and for preparing final property reports and verifying if patent reports are required.\nResearch Accounting: Responsible for preparing and submitting the final financial reports to the sponsor based on information provided by the College Research Administrator via the Account Close or Extension (ACE) form.\u00a0\nProperty Inventory: Responsible for reviewing and submitting final property reports.\nOffice of Technology Management: Responsible for reviewing and submitting final patent reports.\nCLOSING SPONSORED AWARDS:\nAwards are considered completed when all work is finished or on the date the award expires or terminates. If, at the end of the award period, the PI has not received a renewal or no-cost extension and one is not anticipated, closeout of the award must be initiated. The Corporate Controller's Office requires the submission of the Account Close or Extension (ACE) form\u00a0to close the award.\nMost federal grants require awards to be closed within 90 days of the award end date (Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.343 Closeout). Certain federal agencies (NSF and NIH) have specified a 120-day closeout period for final financial disbursements. Closeout requirements for federal contracts and other awards will be specified in the terms and conditions of individual awards.\nThe closeout period (whether 90 days, 120 days, or some other prescribed period) is provided only to correct errors, post charges that were incurred and actualized before the end date, and address other close-out requirements such as final reports. However, transfers of costs and the confirmation of final effort must be done within the period prior to the hold-close date. See below for the definitions of various critical time periods related to fund closeout.\nIn terms of costs, closeout procedures primarily focus on achieving the following in accordance with sponsor and Penn State requirements:\nRemoval of any costs found to be unallowable, unallocable, or unreasonable. (See RA10 for additional guidance.)\nPreparing final financial reports (including cost-share reports) and invoices for submission to the awarding agency\nSecuring final payment from sponsor\nInactivating the account(s) in IBIS\nMany projects also require submission of the following:\nFinal Technical Report\nPatent Report\nProperty Report\nOther reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award\nMany sponsors will not remit final payment until all final technical and financial reports have been received and accepted. Once final payment is received by PSU and all reports submitted, the fund will be marked closed in IBIS and no further expenditures can be charged to the restricted account.\nOnce an award is closed, the associated accounts will not be reopened. However, per federal regulations, the federal awarding agency maintains the right to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or review. Such audits and reviews must be completed within the record retention period.\nCLOSE-OUT TIMELINE AND CHECKLIST:\nThe following timeline is based on the standard 90-day closeout requirements specified above. If a sponsor requires an earlier closeout period or grants additional time to complete closeout, the timeline below will be adjusted accordingly. \n90 days BEFORE budget\/project end date \u2013 Pre-closeout review\nIf the PI needs more time to complete sponsored activities or reporting requirements, a request must be made to the agency. Research Accounting cannot extend the end date of an award. The end date will change when Research Accounting receives the modification from OSP.\nAll direct cost categories (salaries, equipment, supplies, tuition, etc.,) must be reviewed by the PI and Department staff for completeness, accuracy and allowability before the end date or budget period.\nThe PI and Department staff also must review cost-sharing (if applicable) to ensure all cost-sharing requirements will be met prior to the end date of the award.\nAll necessary adjustments should be made before the close of the budget period or if this is not possible, during the 90-day adjustment period.\nEquipment purchases within the last 90 days of the budget period are generally not permitted, and, if done, must be fully documented and justified.\nIf award has sponsor-titled equipment, contact Property Inventory to plan for disposition or transfer to another award.\n30 days BEFORE budget\/project end date\nResearch Accounting will send an Account Close and Extension (ACE) form\u00a0to the College Research Office.\nIf the final invoice for a subaward has not been received, the College Research Office should contact the subawardee.\nWithin 60 days AFTER budget\/project end date \u2013 Post-closeout review\nThe PI and College Research Office will confirm that all expenditures were incurred prior to the end date of the award. (The one exception to this can be found in Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200.461, which permits charging of publication and printing costs between the end date of the award and the closeout of the award. See RA65 for additional guidance regarding the charging of these costs.) All payroll adjustments must be posted either during the budget period or in the adjustment period. For payroll adjustments that are beyond the end date in IBIS, send an extension request form to Research Accounting with explanation of the necessary adjustment.\nIf required, Cost Share reports should be sent to Research Accounting with the ACE.\nThe PI should verify that the final technical report has been submitted to sponsor. It is considered a best practice to provide the College Research Office with a copy of the report cover page and transmittal.\nA signed Account Close and Extension (ACE) form\u00a0must be forwarded to Research Accounting for final invoicing.\nWithin 90 days AFTER budget\/project end date - EXCEPTIONS\nFor federally funded awards, any exception to posting expenditures incurred during the period of performance to restricted accounts beyond the expense-close date must be approved by the University's Office of Naval Research Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or appropriate federal official. Requests for such exceptions must be initially made through Research Accounting. Based on their review and approval of the request, it will be forwarded to the ACO or appropriate federal official for consideration and approval.\nFIXED-PRICE AGREEMENTS- RESIDUAL BALANCE:\nFixed-price agreements are expected to be based on the best estimate of the funds needed to complete a project. In some cases, a small residual balance may remain at the end of the project.\nAt the time the fund is to be closed, the academic unit may retain that portion of the balance representing the unused direct costs; however, the indirect portion must be transferred to the central indirect cost income account. The amount of the residual balance shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the award. This is accomplished by the preparation of a Journal Voucher - Departmental (JVDP), debiting income on the account to be closed, and crediting income in the unit's Miscellaneous General Research Account for the direct expense portion and 00-001-69 UP 10010, Originating Object Code, for the indirect portion.\nAccounts should be closed within a reasonable period after the termination date, but no later than six months after the termination date (or approved extensions).\nAll costs related to a project must be charged to the account at the time the cost is incurred. Investigators may not utilize other funds (general funds or other restricted funds) to support the project in an attempt to generate a residual balance in the restricted account at the end of a project.\nIn cases of significant balances on Industry Member Programs, it is generally advisable to consult with your industrial advisory board on how best to utilize the residual balance. (See RAG05 for more information on Industry Membership Programs.)\nDetailed information may be found at: http:\/\/www.research.psu.edu\/osp\/manage-awards\/cost-reimbursable.\nPROPERTY CONTROL:\nAt the end of a sponsored award, the PI should review all property and equipment acquired or fabricated under the award. All such property and equipment must be properly tagged. Property and equipment acquired with Federal and Commonwealth funds are often subject to certain requirements, even after the awards have ended. For example, even when Penn State has clear title to property and equipment acquired with Federal funds, Penn State may still be subject to rules or additional conditions imposed by the sponsor regarding the equipment (such as not charging depreciation, amortization or use charges on the equipment for any present or future government contract, grant, subcontract, subgrant or similar agreement). In other cases, title to property and equipment will be \"conditional,\" subject to final disposition instructions of the sponsor. In yet other cases, the Federal government will retain title to property and equipment acquired with federal funds. For further guidance regarding ownership and use of property and equipment, see RA70 \u2013 Property & Equipment.\nBS15 - Disposal and Purchase of Obsolete, Surplus or Scrap University-Owned Equipment, Supplies and\/or Materials contains additional guidance regarding government-owned property.\nAUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS:\nIf a PI receives notice of an audit, review or investigation from any sponsoring agency or independent auditor, the Corporate Controller's Office must be notified immediately through the Financial Officer. PIs and others involved in a sponsored award should not discuss or respond to any inquiries related to an audit, review or investigation unless told to do so by the Corporate Controller's Office.\nIf any costs are, or have been, questioned as a result of a federal audit, review or investigation, none of these costs shall be transferred between any other federally sponsored accounts, including costsharing accounts, unless and until expressly approved by the University's Office of Naval Research Administrative Contracting Officer after a formal Government determination as to the allowability of those questioned costs. This applies even if the contract has not yet reached its end date.\nRECORD RETENTION:\nThe requirement to retain records does not end with closeout, nor does the sponsor's right to audit the records. See Policy AD35 \u2013 University Archives and Records Management. According to the Uniform Guidance:\nFinancial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other non-Federal entity records pertinent to a Federal award must be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for Federal awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, respectively, as reported to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient (2 CFR 200.333).\n\nIf Penn State is notified that an account will be audited, all records must be held until the audit is completed, even if they will be held past the normal record retention period.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nFor questions, additional detail, or to request changes to this policy, please contact the Office of the Vice President for Research, or the Office of the Corporate Controller.\nCROSS REFERENCES:\nOther Policies may have specific application and should be referred to, especially;\nAD35 - University Archives and Records Management\nBS15 - Disposal and Purchase of Obsolete, Surplus or Scrap University-Owned Equipment, Supplies and\/or Materials\nRA10 - Costing Principles for Sponsored Awards (Formerly RA01)\nRA65 - Non-Personnel Costs\nRA70 - Use of Equipment Purchased on Federally Sponsored Projects (Formerly RA07)\nEffective Date: September 20, 2017\n\tDate Approved: September 18, 2017\n\tPublished Date: September 19, 2017\nMost recent changes:\nSeptember 11, 2017 - Revisions to the Fixed-Price Agreements - Residual Balance section\nRevision History (and effective dates):\nFebruary 26, 2016 - This new policy (incorporating parts of RAG05 and RAG08) has been created as part of the policy reorganization brought about by the implementation of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200).\nMarch 7, 2005 - Editorial changes to put in links to OMB Circular A-110\nOctober 28, 2004 - Editorial change: Under the HOLD CLOSE DATE section the term \"end date\" was changed to \"close date\".\nDecember 1, 2000 - New Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 The Pennsylvania State University.\n      All Rights reserved.\nLegal Statements | PSU Hotlines\n\n\n\nContact Us\nAccessibility\nStaff Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","summary":"To establish policy for finalization and closeout of sponsored awards."}]
