However, acting or interim appointments may continue beyond a one-year period, subject to approval as a personnel matter pursuant to Regent Policy 2.K.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAs determined by the Appointing Authority, a statement regarding the position the prospective appointee already occupies, in the form of one of the following options:\n\t\t\nThe Appointing authority may allow the prospective appointee to remain in the position s\/he already occupies, and assign the additional duties and responsibilities of the Administrative Position on an acting or interim basis;\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nAs an inducement for the prospective appointee to accept the acting or interim appointment, the Appointing Authority may agree to hold open the position already occupied by the prospective appointee, or to fill the position already occupied by the prospective appointee on a temporary basis, for the duration of the acting or interim appointment;\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe Appointing Authority may decide that the position already occupied by the prospective appointee shall remain subject to administrative discretion as exercised in the normal course of business.\n\nA statement regarding the Appointing Authority's determination of a reasonable and appropriate salary to be paid to the prospective appointee while serving in the acting or interim capacity. Such determination shall be subject to the regular salary approval process, pursuant to Regent Policy 2.K and Regent Policy 11.C.\n\t\t\u00a0\nA statement regarding terms and conditions for annual and sick leave accrual, and benefits eligibility for the period of the interim appointment; or, the terms and conditions of such benefits that depart from those of a regular university staff appointment (if any), subject to advance, written approval of the respective campus or system administration human resources office.\n\t\t\u00a0\nExcept as otherwise provided in a term employment contract as approved by the Board of Regents, the following statements regarding at-will employment; controlling terms and conditions, and ethical standards, as follows:\n\t\t\nThis is an at-will appointment and is subject to all the rules and policies of the university. Your employment is subject to termination by either you or the university at any time. Except as provided by law, no compensation shall be owed or paid to you upon or after the termination of your employment unless it was earned prior to termination.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe terms and conditions of this acting or interim appointment as stated in this letter of offer supersede any conflicting provisions that may be contained in employee handbooks, but may not supersede Regent Laws or Policies or state law. However, the terms and conditions of this acting or interim appointment are subject to any changes to the university's employment policies that affect all employees of the university staff class, as applicable.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nYou (the appointee) agree to uphold ethical standards appropriate to your position, including, but not limited to, complying with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies, and reporting suspected or known noncompliance as required by Regent and University policies.\n\nIf the prospective appointee is a certified employee of the state personnel system, the letter of offer shall include a statement providing for a leave without pay from the classified position that the prospective appointee already occupies, for the duration of the initial period of the acting or interim appointment. Such statement shall also provide that upon termination of the initial period of the acting or interim appointment, the appointee shall be reinstated to her\/his former classified position, without loss of any rights or benefits accruing to that position in her\/his absence, and with restoration of all accrued unused leave remaining at the time of acceptance of the acting or interim appointment.

BensonResponsible University Officer:\u00a0Vice President for Academic AffairsResponsible Office:\u00a0Office of the Vice President for Academic AffairsPolicy Contact:\u00a0Office of the Vice President for Academic AffairsSupersedes:\u00a0Misconduct in Research and Authorship, December 31, 1998Last Reviewed\/Updated date:\u00a0November 1, 2013Applies to:\u00a0University-wide\n\n\n\nThe Board of Regents of the University have set forth these principles in the Laws of the Regents and state that, \"the faculty takes the lead in decisions concerning selection of faculty, educational policy related to teaching, curriculum, research, academic ethics, and other academic matters,\" Article 5.E.5.\nAllegations of misconduct in research, scholarship, and creative activities differ in any number of ways and no single, detailed course of action is possible or desirable. Thus, this policy provides the fundamental framework to respond to allegations of misconduct in research, scholarship, and creative activities. Campus officials shall work within this framework to ensure consistency in practice among the campuses.\nThe University receives research funding from the U.S. Government and federal laws require recipients to have a policy and implementing procedures on misconduct in research, scholarship, and creative activities. When implementing our policy, the University will conform to these federal laws. In some cases, the federal funding agency may also have the authority to initiate its own investigation and the University will cooperate fully in any such investigation.\nThe University has academic dishonesty procedures that generally take precedence for allegations involving student course work.1\nSCOPE:\u00a0This policy covers any person who, at the time of the alleged misconduct in research, was employed by, was an agent of, or was affiliated by contract or agreement with the University and any person who is alleged to have committed research misconduct prior to his or her employment, agency or affiliation with the University provided the campus faculty committee on research misconduct determines that such allegations of research misconduct have the potential to affect the reputation of the University.\nII. \u00a0Policy Statement\n\n\nReporting:\n\n\tUniversity employees have an obligation to report observed or suspected Misconduct in Research to the designated campus Research Integrity Officer. Except to the extent necessary to comply with reporting requirements or state law, or to defend any legal action which might be asserted against the University, the Research Integrity Officer will maintain confidential any such discussions or consultations regarding concerns of possible Misconduct in Research.\n\t\u00a0\nCooperation with Misconduct in Research Proceedings:\n\n\t\u00a0Members of the University community are obligated to cooperate with and provide evidence relevant to an allegation of Misconduct in Research to the Research Integrity Officer, the faculty committee on research misconduct, and other institutional officials. Any member of the University community who fails or refuses to cooperate with the inquiry or investigative process shall be reported to the appropriate dean or vice-chancellor; such non-cooperation may constitute the basis for disciplinary action. Nothing here will be interpreted in such a way as to infringe on an employee\u2019s right to invoke the protection of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution with regard to self-incrimination.\n\t\u00a0\nNon-Retaliation:\n\n\tThe University prohibits retaliation of any kind against Complainants, witnesses, or committee members. Employees should immediately report any alleged or apparent retaliation to the Research Integrity Officer or to the CU Ethics Line.\n\t\u00a0\nConfidentiality:\n\n\tThe University shall take reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of all allegations, inquiries, investigations, resolutions and any documentation and communications related to these activities. The Research Integrity Officer and the faculty committee on research misconduct shall request all persons involved maintain confidentiality during the inquiry and investigative processes, including through the use of confidentiality agreements.\n\n\tDuring the course of any inquiry or investigation, the University may disclose information to the extent required by law, or, if the seriousness of the alleged Misconduct in Research warrants disclosure pending the outcome of the inquiry or investigation. Without limitation such instances include where the disclosure is necessary: (1) to prevent an immediate health hazard; (2) to protect the University\u2019s resources or reputation; (3) to protect the interests of the academic community; (4) to protect any person\u2019s resources or reputation; (5) to comply with the University\u2019s obligations to any state or federal agency, or (6) to correct misinformation made available to the public about the alleged Misconduct in Research and the University\u2019s response.\n\n\tNotwithstanding any other provision in this Administrative Policy Statement or the campus specific procedures, the University shall disclose any information reasonably necessary for it to comply with state and federal law.\n\t\u00a0\nConflict of Interest or Bias:\n\n\tEach campus shall ensure its faculty committee on research misconduct conducts proceedings on an impartial basis. Committee members are expected to reveal any actual or potential conflicts of interest to the committee including: (1) previous personal knowledge of or involvement in the matter, forming the basis of the allegation of Misconduct in Research, (2) close, personal, professional or financial relationship with the Complainant, Respondent, or any other participant in the inquiry or investigative processes. The campus specific procedures shall address management of such conflicts.\n\t\u00a0\nEducation of the University Community:\n\n\tEach campus shall ensure its deans, directors, chairs, and graduate advisors shall be reminded annually of this Administrative Policy on Misconduct in Research, Scholarship, and Creative activities and of the campus specific procedures. The University shall also inform all faculty, students, and staff of (1) the need for integrity in research performance and (2) the role of the faculty committee on research misconduct.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF A FINDING OF MISCONDUCT IN RESEARCH\n\u00a0If misconduct in Research is found to have occurred, responsible individuals may face a range of appropriate sanctions, from warning to dismissal. Disciplinary action will be taken only in accordance with applicable University rules and procedures. The sanction(s) must correspond to the severity of the confirmed deviation. For example, misconduct that involves classified staff may necessitate resorting to procedures and sanctions established by the State Personnel System. Misconduct in Research that involves students may result in disciplinary action taken in accordance with appropriate campus policies. Misconduct in Research involving faculty may give rise to sanctions that require involvement of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee.\nSponsors or law enforcement officials may also take action against either individuals or the University itself, if Misconduct in Research is established. These actions may include, but are not limited to, letters of reprimand, suspension of an active award, and\/or debarment from future awards. The federal agencies may choose to proceed in their own investigation, or may decide to act upon the University's findings.\nIf an allegation of Misconduct in Research is not confirmed, the University will make reasonable efforts to restore the reputation of the individual alleged to have engaged in the Misconduct in Research.\nIII. \u00a0Definitions\n\n\nResearch:\n\n\tThe University broadly defines\u00a0research, scholarship, and creative activities\u00a0to include all forms of scholarship and creative activities within the responsibilities of faculty, staff, or students that are designed as original works or are intended to contribute to generalizable knowledge in a field of academic inquiry. The terms\u00a0research\u00a0and\u00a0research, scholarship, and creative activities\u00a0are used interchangeably throughout this policy.\n\t\u00a0\nMisconduct in Research:\n\nMisconduct in Research\u00a0means:\n\n\n\n\nFabrication, falsification, plagiarism and other forms of misrepresentation of ideas, and other serious deviations from accepted practices in proposing, carrying out, reviewing, or reporting results from research;\nFailure to comply with established standards regarding author name on publications;\nRetaliation of any kind against a person who, in good faith, reported or provided information about suspected or alleged misconduct in research.\nMisconduct in research does not include honest error or differences of opinion.\n\n\nIV. \u00a0Roles and Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\nChancellor:\n\n\t\tOn each campus, the chancellor is responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy. The chancellor shall designate an institutional official who will be responsible for developing more specific written procedures for supplementing this policy.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\u00a0Complainant:\n\n\t\tThe Complainant is the individual who submits a written allegation of misconduct in research to the campus research integrity officer or faculty committee on research misconduct. The University requires any person who makes an allegation of misconduct in research to proceed in good faith and with a reasonable basis for believing that misconduct in research occurred.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\u00a0Deciding Official:\n\n\t\tThe Deciding Official is the institutional official who receives the investigative report from the faculty committee on research misconduct and determines the appropriate institutional response. Each campus shall designate a senior level administrator, e.g., provost, as the Deciding Official but the Deciding Official shall not be the same person as the Research Integrity Officer.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFaculty Committee on Research Misconduct:\n\n\t\tUniversity faculty are responsible for emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct in research to staff, students and others who are under their supervision and for providing reasonable supervision to minimize the opportunities for Misconduct in Research Each campus shall convene a faculty committee to promote exemplary ethical standards of research conduct, to publicize this Administrative Policy Statement and campus specific procedures for reporting Misconduct in Research, to receive allegations of misconduct, to ensure thorough, fair and expeditions proceedings for the evaluation of allegations, and to recommend possible disciplinary action, policy changes or other actions to remedy the misconduct and to prevent similar misconduct in the future.\n\t\t\u00a0\nResearch Integrity Officer:\n\n\t\tEach campus shall appoint the Research Integrity Officer who shall be responsible for implementing this Administrative Policy Statement and the campus specific procedures. Each campus shall specify the duties of the Research Integrity Officer which may include but not be limited to advising any person who is considering whether to submit an allegation of Misconduct in Research, providing guidance on the requirements of the Administrative Policy Statement and campus specific procedures, coordinating the work of the faculty committee on research misconduct, and administering the campus specific procedures.\n\n\t\tThroughout the research misconduct inquiry and investigation, the Research Integrity Officer will monitor the proceedings to determine if there is any threat or harm to public health, federal funds and equipment, or the integrity of the federally-supported research process. In the event of such a threat, the Research Integrity Officer will, in consultation with other institutional officials and the funding agency, take appropriate interim action to protect against any such threat.\n\t\t\u00a0\nRespondent:\n\n\t\tThe Respondent is the person against whom an allegation of Misconduct in Research has been made. The campus specific procedures shall describe the rights held by the Respondent that the faculty committee on research misconduct shall preserve during any process conducted pursuant to this Administrative Policy.\n\t\t\u00a0\nUniversity Counsel:\n\n\t\tThe faculty committee on research misconduct, the Research Integrity Officer and the Deciding Official can seek advice and counsel from the Office of the University Counsel as it deems necessary. The Research Integrity Officer shall notify the Office of University Counsel of the meetings of the faculty committee on research misconduct and provide minutes of such proceedings. University Counsel may send a representative to attend meetings of the faculty committee on research misconduct or any subcommittee if the University Counsel considers that such attendance is in the best interests of the University.\n\n\nV. \u00a0Implementation\n\n\n\u00a0Standing Committees.\n\n\tFaculty on each campus shall establish a standing committee to carry out this policy. The size and composition of the committees shall be established by the appropriate faculty governing body in consultation with the campus designated administrative leader. Members should serve staggered and multi-year terms to assure consistency and continuity of actions.\n\t\u00a0\nStanding Committee\u2019s Role.\n\n\tEach standing committee shall:\n\t\nTake appropriate action to maximize awareness of the need to avoid activities that might be misinterpreted as Misconduct in Research, encourage each unit to develop and promulgate standards for authorship, and otherwise enhance ethics in research related activities.\nBe widely recognized on each campus as the group to whom suspected Misconduct in Research is to be reported.\nReceive allegations that the Research Integrity Officer or designee has determined to warrant an inquiry of Misconduct in Research.2\nEnsure that an appropriate balance is struck between protecting the rights of the Respondent and protecting the Complainant from possible retaliation. The course of action must be suitable to the circumstances of each individual case.\nPromptly report to the appropriate dean, vice chancellor and university counsel any allegation that is judged to be without reasonable basis in fact.\nPromptly notify the appropriate dean and vice chancellor, as well as the appropriate regulatory agencies and\/or sponsor3\u00a0at any time during a Misconduct in Research proceeding if it has reason to believe that any of the following conditions exist:\n\t\t\nHealth or safety of the public is at risk, including an immediate need to protect human or animal subjects.\nResources or interests are threatened.\nResearch activities should be suspended.\nThere is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law.\nFederal action is required to protect the interests of those involved in the Misconduct in Research proceeding.\nThe research institution believes the Misconduct in Research proceeding may be made public prematurely so that the appropriate regulatory agency may take appropriate steps to safeguard evidence and protect the rights of those involved.\nThe research or academic community or public should be informed.\n\nEstablish operating rules and procedures to carry out this policy, including the development of operating procedures for investigative committees that may be created.\nTake appropriate steps to ensure that all persons adhere to established operating rules and procedures.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nCampus Procedures.\n\n\tEach campus shall adhere to federal regulations mandated by the appropriate agencies and\/or sponsors for Misconduct in Research, scholarship, and creative activities and with guidelines established in this policy. At a minimum, the procedures should address:\n\t\nThe inquiry and investigative processes that comply with the requirements of the requirements of NSF and\/or PHS.\nIdentification of campus Research Integrity Officer.\nHow the campus Research Integrity Officer will receive allegations of Misconduct in Research, scholarship, and creative activities.\nThe committee\u2019s membership and selection process.\nThe processes to determine if an allegation warrants an inquiry.\nThe inquiry process.\nThe investigation process.\nThe reporting and recommendation process.\nThe process by which an individual may appeal a decision.\nThe campus training and advice about responsible conduct of research.\nPeriodic review of the process by the campus.\nThe procedures for ensuring intra-campus coordination among all organizations with a role in oversight of research as may be applicable: the employee, his\/her department or academic unit, sponsored programs office, research committees, Technology Transfer, and appropriate University Officers.\nThe process by which the campus will make available publicly its implementation procedures for this policy.\nThe enforcement mechanisms and for sanctions process.\nIn all cases, the campus will comply in substance with sponsor requirements.\n\n\t\tMisconduct in Research, scholarship, and creative activities does not include honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data. Where a person\u2019s conduct otherwise constitutes Misconduct in Research, however, the burden of proof lies with that person to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her conduct represents honest error or differences in interpretation.\n\n\t\tIf the allegations of Misconduct in Research relate to Federally-funded research and the Federal funding agency\u2019s definition of Misconduct in Research is more limited than the definition set forth here, the Federal funding agency\u2019s definition of research misconduct shall apply for determining whether such research misconduct shall be reported to the Federal funding agency or other appropriate authority. The University\u2019s definition of Misconduct in Research, however, shall continue to apply for the University\u2019s internal administrative purposes, including the imposition of discipline against any person who is determined to have engaged in conduct that meets the University\u2019s definition of Misconduct in Research.\n\n\nVI. \u00a0History\n\n\n\nOriginal policy effective August 18, 1988\nRevised December 15, 1989\nRevised December 31, 1998\nRevised July 1, 2011\nReviewed November 1, 2013 - Non-substantive changes only\n\n\nVII. \u00a0Key Words\nMisconduct, research, faculty, integrity\n1.

This does not include an individual who has never attended or never enrolled at the institution. associated with the University who knows of or suspects fiscal misconductFiscal misconductAs defined and illustrated in the Administrative Policy Statement Fiscal Misconduct Reporting, deliberate acts or failure to act regarding fiscal matters, contrary to established law, rule or policy, with the intent to obtain an unauthorized benefit, which results in a loss or other damage to the University. must promptly notify either one's immediate supervisor or one of the following investigative units: the Department of Internal Audit, Office of University Counsel, the appropriate campus police department, and\/or the appropriate campus Human Resources or Personnel department. This duty to report by an individual or supervisor is in compliance with State law and State Fiscal Rules. State employees have \"whistle blower\" protection from State law when they are in compliance with the requirements set forth in statute.\nBecause of the often unique and complex nature of fiscal misconduct, which investigative unit to contact first may be a function of the situation. The Department of Internal Audit and Office of University Counsel are more often the preferred primary contacts because these units have more flexibility in the manner in which they conduct a review or investigation where there is some doubt about what actually occurred. In any case, the notified investigative unit shall contact the other units to establish the necessary team to progress with the review or investigation.\nAll affected departments and\/or individuals shall cooperate fully with the investigative team to identify whether or not actual or suspected fiscal misconduct has occurred.\nThe investigative team shall keep University campus officials apprised of on-going investigations as appropriate. Given the nature of some of these investigations, there are times when the scope of the problem must be determined before notification is possible.\nLoss reporting will follow standard University processes for each investigative unit. The Internal Auditor will report all instances of actual loss greater than $10,000 to the State Division of Accounts and Control.

It is preferred to contact the Department of Internal Audit first;\nFully securing and strictly limiting access to any relevant computer and manual records as soon as the fiscal misconduct is suspected, or when there is reason to believe further losses may occur. Common steps may include changes in staff assignments, obtaining keys, removing systems access, stopping long-distance telephone access, and reassigning signature and approval authority;\nNot confronting or accusing the individual suspected of fiscal misconduct and not making any arrangements for resolution of the matter without consultation with the appropriate personnel officer, the Department of Internal Audit, and\/or legal counsel as noted in (b) above;\nUsing discretion and not discussing the circumstances with persons not involved in the incident or with persons without an essential need-to-know. Supervisors can and should be informed if first cleared by the investigative team;\nAt the completion of any investigation, implementing changes in policy and procedures for improved internal controls to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nThe University Department of Internal Audit is responsible for:\n\t\nConducting an\u00c2\u00a0 assessment of an incident where insufficient facts or evidence is apparent to determine if, in fact, fiscal misconduct has occurred;\nNotifying other departments, units and\/or University campus officials who may need to be involved in a review or investigation as appropriate;\nWhen a loss has occurred, determining how the loss occurred, the amount of the loss, and possible individuals involved.

For example, inconsistent birth dates;\nPersonal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity. \u00a0For example, the address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application;\nPersonal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity. For example:\n\t\t\t\nThe address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or\nThe phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or answering service;\nThe SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or by other customers;\nThe address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.\n\nThe customer or the person opening the covered account fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application when requested.\nWhen using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name, etc.), the customer or the person opening the covered account cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report.\n\nUnusual or suspicious activity related to the covered account such as:\n\nShortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the organizational unit receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.\nA new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud. For example, the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.\nAn account which is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:\n\t\t\t\nNonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;\nA material change in purchasing or usage patterns\n\nAn account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).\nMail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account.\nThe organizational unit is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.\nThe organizational unit is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account.\nThe organizational unit receives notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the organizational unit.\nThe organizational unit is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.\n\n\nRequired Red Flag Procedures\n\n\tWhen potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must act quickly because a rapid and appropriate response can protect the University and its customers from damages and loss. Follow the steps below:\n\t\nGather all related documentation and write a description of the situation.\nPresent this information to the GLB (Gramm-Leach-Bliley) Compliance Officer for determination.\nThe GLB Compliance Officer will complete additional authentication to determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.\n\n\nIf a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions must be taken immediately. Actions may include:\n\n\n\nCanceling the transaction;\nNotifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;\nDetermining the extent of liability of the University; and\nNotifying the actual customer that fraud has been attempted.\n\n\nIII.

The academic life necessarily entails activity in all areas.\nThe University recognizes that there are legitimate differences in: (i) faculty development needs, (ii) interests and areas of expertise among faculty members, (iii) conventions particular to academic disciplines, and (iv) academic unit program needs. A prescriptive, rigid, and\/or uniform formula that inflexibly dictates annual workloads for individual faculty is not conducive to responding to these differences. \u00a0\u00a0Thus, the university has developed a differentiated workload policy to address these needs.\u00a0\n\nEach campus shall develop a written policy on differentiated workload. Such policies may permit a school or college not to offer differentiated workloads.\u00a0 Faculty representatives shall be involved in the development and implementation of differentiated workload policies at the campus level.\u00a0 These policies shall be consistent with: (i) the University's commitment to its mission of teaching, research\/creative work, and leadership and service; (ii) the development and advancement needs of individual faculty members; (iii) conventions particular to academic disciplines such as clinical or professional practice; (iv) academic unit program needs; and (v) the goals and objectives of the primary unit and campus. \u00a0Annual assessment and reward of each faculty member shall consider the assigned workload.\n\nCampus policies shall include:\n\nCriteria for evaluating the propriety of a differentiated workload assignment. These criteria shall ensure that the differentiated workload of an individual faculty member does not compromise his\/her ability to satisfy specific evaluation criteria for tenure and\/or promotion, as described in the Standards, Processes and Procedures for Comprehensive Review, Tenure, Post-Tenure Review and Promotion\u200b.\nA mechanism for ensuring collaboration between the primary unit chair and individual faculty members for the purposes:(i) of deciding whether a differentiated workload assignment is appropriate; and (ii) of determining an appropriate balance between the development and advancement needs of the individual faculty member, the program needs of the primary unit, and the University's commitment to teaching, research\/creative work, leadership and service, and, where appropriate, clinical and professional practice.\nA mechanism for ensuring that subsequent annual merit increases for an individual faculty member reflects the agreed upon differentiated workload.\u00a0\nProvision for a written statement describing the agreement on differentiated annual workloads and expectations for the relevant academic year.\nIn order to ensure appropriate communication between faculty and the primary unit chair, and a clear understanding of the appropriate uses of differentiated annual workloads, each Chancellor should provide for training and orientation for primary unit heads and other academic administrators.\n\nThis policy pertains only to annual workloads. Utilization of annual differentiated workloads shall not compromise standards governing the award of tenure and promotion, which is clearly stipulated in the Laws of the Regents (Article 5.B.4.(B)).\u00a0 In the years prior to tenure and promotion to associate professor, careful assignment of annual workload is critical to ensure that faculty members have the time needed to develop a record of achievement in teaching, research\/creative work (and where appropriate, professional and clinical practice), and leadership and service required for the award of tenure.\u00a0 Thus, in most cases, differentiated workloads should not be assigned to faculty members on a seven-year tenure clock.\u00a0 Similar care shall be given to workload assignments prior to promotion to full professor and for faculty in units with \u201cup-or-out\u201d promotion clocks.\u00a0\nThis policy creates no unilateral rights for a faculty member to insist on a particular workload assignment.\nRelated Policies, Procedures, Forms, Guidelines, and Other Resources\n\n\nAdministrative Policy Statements (APS) and Other Policies\n\n\n\n\nStandards, Processes and Procedures for Comprehensive Review, Tenure, Post-Tenure Review and Promotion\u200b\nAPS on Performance Ratings for Faculty\nLaws of the Regents, Article 5.B.4(B)\nLaws of the Regents, Article 11.A.1(E)\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nInitial Policy Effective:\u00a0 July 1, 1989\nRevised: July 1, 2007\nThe term \u201cservice\u201d was replaced with the term \u201cleadership and service\u201d effective April 30, 2014 per resolution of the CU Board of Regents.\nRevised: July 1, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"The intent of this policy is to affirm the University\u2019s commitment to appropriate use of differentiated workloads."},{"university":"cu","name":"6002","policy":"\n\nAPS 6002 -

Policy Statement\n\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of the Chair\n\n\tRegent Policy 4.A.1 delegates the development of the working structure of a department to the department in consultation with the appropriate dean. Each college and school has its own mechanism in place to select the department chair and to define the specific roles and responsibilities. In all instances, it is recognized that the department chair is first and foremost a member of the faculty, a teacher and scholar of the highest order, contributing to the academic and scholarly missions of the department. As chair, the faculty member is also the designated administrative leader of the department and the leader of the faculty, staff, and students who comprise the department.\n\t\nLeader of the Department\n\t\t\nThe chair has the responsibility for providing leadership toward the achievement of the highest possible level of excellence in the teaching, research\/creative work, and leadership and service1 activities of the department. The chair is expected to articulate the goals of the department, both within and outside the department, to articulate the department's actions or requests in pursuit of these aims, and to maintain a climate that is collegial, that respects diversity, that treats faculty, staff and learners fairly and supports creativity and innovation. The chair has the responsibility to inform the department of the stances and actions of the dean and other administrators that might affect the department.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nAs the chief administrator for the department, the chair is the essential link between the administration and the department in representing departmental views on matters of educational policy and academic ethics.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe chair is responsible for the recruitment, selection, and evaluation of both the academic and the staff personnel of the department. In consultation with colleagues, and in compliance with the appropriate departmental procedures, the chair recommends appointments, promotion, merit increases, and terminations. The chair has the explicit responsibility to ensure that faculty members are aware of the departmental, college, and campus criteria prescribed for appointment, reappointment, promotion, tenure, and post-tenure review, and to make appraisals and recommendations in accordance with the procedures and principles stated in department, school\/college, or campus policy and in the Laws of the Regents and APS 1022 - Standards, Processes and Procedures for Comprehensive Review, Tenure, Post-Tenure Review and Promotion. The chair also has the explicit responsibility to ensure that adequate faculty mentoring programs are in place and that faculty performance reviews are conducted regularly, in accordance with the procedures and principles stated in the Laws of the Regents and APS 1021 - Mentoring for Tenure-Track and Tenure-Eligible Faculty.\n\n\t\t\tThe chair shall be familiar with the state personnel system, and ensure that staff members are aware of departmental expectations and of state personnel system criteria for appointment, reappointment, job classification, and promotion.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe chair should be receptive to questions, complaints, grievances, and suggestions from members of the department, both academic personnel and staff, and from students. The chair has the responsibility to take appropriate action.\n\nAdministrator of the Department\n\n\t\tAlthough special assignments may be added from time to time, and the dean or chancellor may specify additional duties, the chair, as the head administrator of the department, has the following responsibilities:\n\t\t\nAssignment of teaching and other duties within the department consistent with appropriate FTE levels and college\/school workload expectations, recognizing that the appropriate mix of teaching, research\/creative work, scholarship, professional practice, clinical work and leadership and service may differ from person to person, and from time to time in the career of an individual.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nPreparation of the schedule of courses and of times and places for class meetings.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nArrangement and assignment of duty for mentoring of students and for training and supervision of teaching assistants and other student teachers and teacher aides.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nPreparation of the budget and administration of the financial affairs of the department, in strict accordance with dollar and FTE allocations and in accord with University rules and procedures.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nRecommendation of sabbatical assignments and leaves of absence to the dean, and confirmation that scheduling is consistent with departmental needs.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nPrompt reporting of the resignation or death of any member of the department to the dean\u2019s office.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nCustody and authorized use of University property charged to the department, and assignment of departmental space and facilities to authorized activities in accordance with University policy and campus rules and regulations.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nDepartmental observance of proper health and safety regulations, in coordination with the campus environmental health and safety officer.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nMaintenance of records and faculty and staff personnel files, and preparation of reports in accordance with the University and college procedures.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nReporting on faculty compliance with the \"one-sixth\" rule (Regent Policy 5.E) or other policies specific to the college or school regarding outside consulting and other professional activities.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nAssisting the dean, or appropriate administrators, in ensuring compliance with all existing conflict of interest management plans established by university policy.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nReporting to the dean, or appropriate administrators, whenever the problem cannot be expeditiously resolved at the departmental level, any failure of an academic or staff member of the department to carry out responsibilities, and recommending appropriate remedial and\/or disciplinary action.\n\n\t\t\tWhile assuming the responsibilities listed above, the chair is expected to seek the advice of departmental faculty colleagues in a systematic way, to provide for the conduct of department affairs in an orderly manner through department meetings and the appointment of appropriate committees, and to keep department members informed of his or her actions in a timely manner. The chair is also expected to seek student advice on matters of concern to students enrolled in the department's programs. In large departments, the chair may be assisted by a vice chair or other colleagues in carrying out his or her responsibilities and, when necessary, by an executive committee chosen in accordance with unit bylaws.\n\n\nAppointment\n\t\nCriteria\n\n\t\tThe appointment of department chairs should be based on the following criteria:\n\t\t\nAbility to provide intellectual leadership in the development of departmental faculty and programs;\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nAbility to provide administrative leadership in the effective functioning of the department; and\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nPersonal skills to permit effective interactions with faculty, administrators, and staff within the college and campus structure.\n\nProcedures: Boulder Campus; Colorado Springs Campus; Denver Campus and the Anschutz\u00a0Medical Campus College of Nursing\n\t\t\nPrior to initiating search and nomination procedures for a department chair, the faculty of the department should meet with the dean of the school or college to discuss the needs and expectations of the department as they relate to the appointment of a new chair, the role of the chair, and the type of search (i.e., internal or external) that will most likely assure that an appropriate candidate is recommended, and to discuss any budgetary considerations related to the search for and appointment of a new chair.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nA search and nominating process will be carried out by the faculty of the department in accordance with department procedures. The faculty will subsequently submit its recommendation to the dean.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nIf the dean does not concur with the department faculty's recommendation, the dean will meet with the department faculty to discuss his\/her reasons for disagreement.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe campus chancellor has ultimate appointment authority for all department chairs.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nIt will be the responsibility of the deans and the chancellors to assure that recruitment and appointment procedures for department chairs reflect the University's commitment to equal opportunity and non-discrimination, as articulated in Regent Law (Article 10) and Regent Policy 10.A.\n\n\t\t\tIn order to achieve this objective, efforts should be made to provide experience for women and underrepresented groups consistent with the university\u2019s policies on equal opportunity and non-discrimination that will prepare them for these positions.\n\nProcedures: Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, Pharmacy, and Public Health\n\t\t\nPrior to establishing a search committee for a department chair, the dean will meet with the faculty of the affected department to discuss the needs and expectations of the department as they relate to the appointment of a new chair, the role of the chair, and the type of search (i.e., internal or external) that will most likely assure that an appropriate candidate is recommended, and to discuss any budgetary considerations related to the search and appointment of a new chair.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nA search committee will be appointed by the dean, and will include departmental representation. At the School of Medicine the search committee will be appointed by the dean, after consultation with the Faculty Officers. The dean will determine whether the search committee will include departmental representation.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe search committee will recommend one or more candidates for the chair to the dean in accordance with school procedures. At appropriate times during the search process, the dean will discuss the candidate pool with the faculty in the department concerned.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe campus chancellor will have the ultimate appointment authority for all department chairs.\n\n\t\t\tIt will be the responsibility of the deans and the chancellors to assure that recruitment and appointment procedures for department chairs reflect the University's commitment to equal opportunity and non-discrimination, as articulated in Regent Law (Article 10) and Regent Policy 10.A.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nIn order to achieve this objective, efforts should be made to provide experience for women and underrepresented groups consistent with the university\u2019s policies on equal opportunity and non-discrimination that will prepare them for these positions.\n\nTerm of Appointment\n\t\t\nConsistent with Colorado state law, the position of chair is an at-will administrative position.\n\n\nEvaluation\n\t\nAll department chairs will undergo regular performance evaluations by the dean of the college or school. A comprehensive performance evaluation, which includes faculty input, shall be conducted periodically, in accordance with the rules of the college or school.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nFormal input from other department constituencies (i.e., staff and students and other departments) will be obtained as part of the evaluation process.\n\nOrientation\n\t\nFor all new department chairs, each dean will develop an orientation program within his\/her unit. The orientation program should provide information that will enable the department chair to function more effectively and efficiently. Areas that should be addressed in the orientation program include University personnel procedures for faculty and staff, especially those relating to appointment, reappointment, tenure, and promotion; the budget and planning processes; development of new degree programs; faculty governance relationships; relationships with other offices such as contracts and grants and with the administrative hierarchy; and other areas that are relevant to the department. In consultation with the departments and the provost, each dean may consider developing other types of programs and vehicles that will enhance the ability of the department chair to provide strong leadership.\n\t\t\u00a0\nWith the support and participation of the president's office, each campus chancellor will be responsible for assuring that appropriate orientation programs are developed for chairs. The orientation programs may be presented on a campus-wide basis or by college or school. Each campus chancellor also will be responsible for developing formal mechanisms to assure that the program and management information necessary for the department chair to function effectively is provided to the department chair in a timely manner.\n\nCompensation\n\t\nWithin budgetary limitations, the administration will make a commitment to provide a level of support to department chairs (including compensation and other forms of support) that makes the job of department chair more attractive and recognizes the value of strong leadership.\n\t\t\u00a0\nA special stipend or other form of compensation will be provided to department chairs to recognize the important leadership role they play. The size of the stipend should be determined in the context of the size of the department, the functions of the chair, and other types of support that will be provided to the chair.\n\n\nIII.

A faculty member's performance shall be evaluated based upon performance standards developed by each academic unit and according to any written expectations agreed to between the faculty member and the unit.\nTo assist in the annual merit evaluation process, faculty members, except those on leave, must provide written evidence of their performance, using appropriate format for reporting scholarly and other activities, as prescribed by their campus, college\/school or academic unit.\u00a0 Faculty members who fail to provide such evidence will be evaluated as \u201cbelow expectations.\u201d Failure to provide the annual performance report will be viewed as \u201cneglect of duty\u201d and will be the basis for disciplinary action.\u00a0\nThe rating for faculty members will categorize each person's performance with a five to one (5-1) point summary rating. The performance rating will be provided on the attached Annual Performance Rating form for Faculty (Attachment A).\n\t\nThe rated employeeEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. has the right to append a response to the rating if he or she so desires.\nThe supervising authority and rated employee will sign the performance rating form to acknowledge that the rating has been discussed.\nThe supervising authority will retain the original signed rating form and provide the rated employee a copy of the signed form.\n\nThe performance rating form will be placed in the employee's personnel file and is subject to disclosure under the Colorado Open Records Act. Any written justification for the performance rating may also be placed in the personnel file, but it will not be disclosed to anyone other than the employee and university personnel with a demonstrated business need. Human Resources offices are responsible for approving such access.\nPerformance ratings for annual merit or salary adjustment consideration shall be submitted to the Dean in accordance with individual campus-defined submission dates.\nThe justification for the performance rating may consist of a numerical, narrative, or other evaluative processes, at the discretion of the campus.\u00a0 Existing evaluation processes, including the Faculty Report of Professional Activities (FRPA), may be used to arrive at the annual performance rating.\u00a0 A description of the evaluation process and the criteria to be used must be available, in writing, to each faculty member.\u00a0\nArticle 11 of the\u00a0Laws of the Regents\u00a0states, \u201cConsistently\u00a0outstanding\u00a0or\u00a0exceeding expectations\u00a0annual merit performance ratings shall not form the sole basis for tenure, as the process leading to award of tenure is a summary evaluation of a faculty member\u2019s cumulative performance, a process that is separate and distinct from the annual merit performance evaluation.\u201d\nPerformance Improvement Agreement\n\t\nTenured and tenure-track faculty members who receive a rating of \"below expectations\" or \u201cfails to meet expectations\u201d as the result of their annual performance evaluation must participate in developing and implementing a Performance Improvement Agreement (PIA).\u00a0\nFaculty members who do not agree with the rating may request a peer review of their annual performance record using the established primary unit process or a specific written process developed by the unit for this purpose. Subsequently, faculty members who believe the primary unit's evaluation is mistaken may appeal the rating through established grievance procedures in the college\/school. This appeal process should be completed within six weeks or less from the date it is initiated by the faculty member, and no action will be taken to begin a PIA until this appeal process, if invoked, is completed\nWorking with the primary unit head or an appropriate committee of the primary unit (as determined by primary unit policy), the faculty member develops a PIA that includes specific goals, timelines, and benchmarks that will be used to measure progress at periodic intervals. Usually, PIAs will be established for one year, but if research deficiencies warrant longer, the PIA may be set up for two years. The campus administration shall designate an advisor or resource office to provide advice to the faculty member and to the primary unit head\/committee on best practices and models for PIAs and appropriate benchmarks. The next annual merit evaluation following the term of the PIA shall address whether the goals of the PIA have been met.\nIf the goals of the PIA have been met, as evidenced in the next annual merit evaluation after the term of the PIA, the faculty member continues in the current review cycle, whether for comprehensive review, tenure, or post-tenure review.\nIf the goals of the PIA have not been met, an extensive review process shall be initiated.\n\nExtensive Review\n\t\nBecause Extensive Review is designed to assist faculty members who are falling below the level of satisfactory professional performance, it takes place whenever a faculty member establishes a pattern of unsatisfactory performance, as evidenced by two evaluations of performance \"below expectations\" or \u201cfailing to meet expectations\u201d\u00a0 in a five-year period or failure to meet the goals of a PIA.\nFor an Extensive Review, the primary unit examines: (1) the five previous annual\u00a0 performance evaluation reports, or, in the case of a faculty member with fewer than five years at the university, all previous annual performance evaluation reports; (2) the FCQs from those years, peer evaluations, and, if desired, other types of teaching evaluation; (3) evidence of research\/creative work and clinical productivity; (4) the faculty member's previous Professional Plan (and any amendments to the plan, as well as differentiated workload agreements, where present); (5) the faculty member's self-evaluation of performance as it relates to the Professional Plan(s); (6) record of leadership and service activities; and (7) any other material the faculty member would like the unit to consider.\nThe primary unit prepares an evaluative report of the faculty member's teaching, research\/creative work, clinical activity, and leadership and service based upon its review of the materials and information covering the period in question. If there is disagreement about the faculty member's performance in research\/creative work, or if the faculty member under review or the primary unit so requests, the review will also include evaluations from qualified persons external to the University. In this case, the faculty member and the primary unit shall jointly develop a list of external reviewers who will be asked to evaluate the faculty member's performance in research\/creative work.\nPrimary units, colleges\/schools, and campuses may require other materials for Extensive Reviews, if appropriate, but the aim should be to keep the process efficient and effective.\nUpon completion of the evaluative report, the faculty member, working with the appropriate primary unit committee, shall write a Development Plan for the next one or two years with specific goals and actions designed to address the areas of deficiency identified in the Extensive Review process. The Development Plan must address the teaching, research\/creative work, clinical activities, and leadership and service assignments anticipated during the period of the plan. It must describe performance goals in light of identified deficiencies, strategies for improvement, and the time frame (up to two years) in which the problems are to be solved. Further, the Plan must contain definite means of measuring progress in achieving the goals and periodic monitoring of progress. Finally, the Development Plan must be approved by the primary unit head and the dean, following consultation with the appropriate primary unit committee.\nWhile the individual faculty member is responsible ultimately for the successful outcome of the Development Plan, the primary unit has an obligation to assist the faculty member who seeks guidance in developing a realistic plan to remedy the identified areas of deficiency. The campus administration shall designate an advisor or resource office to provide advice to the faculty member and to the primary unit on best practices and models for Development Plans and appropriate benchmarks of progress.\nAssessments of professional competence depend upon peer review. At the conclusion of the Development Plan period, either (1) the faculty and head of the primary unit or (2) the faculty of the appropriate college personnel review committee assess the progress of the faculty member and forward their conclusions to the dean. After consultation with the dean's review committee, the dean determines whether the faculty member has achieved the goals of the Development Plan and thus has returned his\/her professional performance to meeting expectations. Tenured faculty members who are judged to be meeting expectations begin a new 5-year PTR cycle in the next academic year. Those who are judged not to have achieved professional competence will face sanctions, including the possibility of revocation of tenure and dismissal. Copies of the Extensive Review Development Plan and the primary unit's assessment of the progress achieved by the end of the development period will be added to the faculty member's personnel file.\n\nSanctions\n\t\nOrdinarily, in cases where the Development Plan has not produced the desired results, the faculty member will have his\/her tenure revoked and be dismissed. Under certain circumstances, other sanctions may be imposed. Possible sanctions include: suspension of pay, salary reduction, and demotion in rank.\nAn appropriate faculty committee shall recommend sanctions. The chancellor makes the final determination of sanctions. If the chancellor's decision is to recommend revocation of tenure and dismissal of the faculty member to the Board of Regents, the Laws of the Regents provide the faculty member with an opportunity for a hearing and set other conditions for handling such cases. (See Laws of the\u00a0Regents, Article 5.C.1 and 5.C.4; and 8\/27\/66 Regent Action adopting 1940 AAUP Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure).\nRevocation of tenure and dismissal for the cause of demonstrable professional incompetence has long been recognized policy at the University of Colorado and across higher education in the United States.\nProfessional incompetence is defined to mean the failure to perform teaching, research\/creative works, and leadership and service duties in a consistent and satisfactory professional manner. A judgment of professional incompetence is based upon peer review of the faculty member's performance. (Other causes for dismissal also exist and are outlined in\u00a0Article 5.C.1\u00a0of the Laws of the Regents.)\n\n\nIII.

Policy Statement\n\n\n\u00a0Credit for International Baccalaureate Diplomas\n\n\tIn accordance with CRS 23-1-113.2, any student admitted to a University of Colorado campus after June 30, 2003, who has graduated from high school with an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma shall be granted a minimum of 24 semester hours of college credit. No tuition will be charged for these credits. These credits must be granted, however, only if the student receives a score of 4 or better on all examinations administered as part of the IB diploma program.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nCredit for International Baccalaureate Courses and Advanced Placement Exams\n\n\tPer CCHE policy, institutions must apply credit to the appropriate GT Pathways category for a minimum score of 4 on select IB exams and a minimum score of 3 on select AP exams.\u00a0 GT Pathways credit is guaranteed to transfer between Colorado public higher education institutions.\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nInternational Baccalaureate Courses\n\n\t\tSchools and colleges shall grant GT Pathways credit for individual IB courses for which a student has received a minimum score of 4 on the corresponding SL or HL exam, even if a student has not earned an IB diploma.\u00a0 At least three credits shall apply to the appropriate GT pathways content area. A list of exams that have been approved for GT pathways credit is provided by CCHE at http:\/\/highered.colorado.gov\/Academics\/Transfers\/GetCredit.html.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAdvanced Placement Exams\n\n\t\tIf a student has earned a minimum score of 3 on an Advanced Placement (AP) exam, institutions shall apply at least three credits to the appropriate GT Pathways content area. \u00a0\u00a0In the case of AP science exams, if there is a verified laboratory experience that is discipline specific to the AP exam or advanced high school course taken, then at least four credit hours shall apply to the GT-SC1 category.

The campus Information Security Officer will work with the appropriate campus Officer and CIO to determine if the risk caused by a security weakness may be accepted.\nIT service providersIT service providerAny person that designs, builds, implements, supports, or provides an IT service to other University employees, students, or affiliates, using a University IT resource. Examples of IT service providers include: website administrators, workstation support staff, server administrators, software programmers, application developers, data network technicians, user account administrators, and computer center personnel.\u200b (e.g., webmasters, network engineers, server administrators, application developers, desktop support staff, or database administrators) shall implement all applicable Program and IT security policy requirements within their areas of responsibility. IT service providers shall evaluate the effectiveness of IT security safeguards in their areas of responsibility and report any security weaknesses, concerns, or breaches to the campus Information Security Officer.\nData Owner\u200b is a party or entity identified with and widely recognized to have primary authority and decision responsibility over a particular collection of university data. Data owners are accountable for managing, protecting, and ensuring the integrity and usefulness of university data. Data owners have the primary responsibility to ensure the university is following its policies and is in compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Data owners typically are associated with the business functions of an organization rather than technology functions.\nData CustodianData custodianAny party charged with managing a data collection for a data trustee.\u200b is any party charged with managing a data collection for a data owner. Custodians typically have control over a data asset's disposition, whether stored (at rest), in transit, or during creation. Custodians will often have modification or distribution privileges. Data custodians carry a significant responsibility to protect data and prevent unauthorized use. Data custodians are often data providers to data users. Data owners or data stewards may also exercise custodial roles and responsibilities. Data custodians typically are associated with IT units within the university, either central IT organizations or IT offices within academic and administrative units.\nData StewardData stewardA party or entity possessing delegated authority to act on a data trustee's behalf.\u200b is a party or entity possessing delegated authority to act on a data owner's behalf. Data Stewards will often have data custodial responsibilities, but are distinguished from custodians by delegated decision-making authority regarding the data. Data stewards may represent data owners in policy discussions, architectural discussions, or in decision-making forums. Data Stewards actively participate in processes that establish business-context and quality definition for data elements. Data Stewards are more likely to be associated with business functions than IT functions.\nData UserData userAny person or party that utilizes university data to perform his or her job responsibilities.\u200b is any person or party that utilizes university data to perform his or her job responsibilities. To the degree that a data user creates university data and\/or controls the disposition of university data, he or she has responsibility for the custodial care of that data. Data users share responsibility in helping data stewards and custodians manage and protect data by understanding and following the IT and information security policies of the university related to data use.\n\n\nAny exceptions to this policy must be approved by the University CISO.\n\nIII.

For equipment and media that is to be redeployed within the University, the IT service provider shall purge all information not authorized for access by the receiving person(s) prior to redeployment.\n\nAccess Management\n\n\tAlthough studentsStudentAny individual who applies to, is accepted for admission, and enrolls for a course at the University of Colorado. This does not include an individual who has never attended or never enrolled at the institution.\u200b, faculty, and staff require access to University information resources for academic and business purposes, this access must be limited to what is needed for his\/her work. Use of resources beyond that which is authorized results in unnecessary risks to University information with no corresponding academic or business value.\n\t\nUser access management. IT service providers shall manage user access to the IT resources under their responsibility, so that such access is appropriately authorized, documented, and limited to that which is needed to perform authorized tasks. Because a user's responsibilities and relationships with the University change over time, IT service providers shall ensure that user access privileges are regularly reviewed and adjusted to comply with currently authorized activities.\nIT resource access controls. IT service providers shall ensure that IT resources under their responsibility (developed, purchased or otherwise used to handle University information) have adequate features and controls to support the proper management of user access as described in section II.D.1.\nNetwork security controls. IT service providers shall ensure that electronic access to and use of the campus data networks under their responsibility is adequately controlled to protect data network equipment and other networked IT resources.\n\nPhysical and Environmental Security\n\n\tUniversity data centers and IT resources shall be sufficiently protected from physical and environmental threats to prevent the loss, damage, or compromise of assets, and interruption to business activities.\n\t\nData centers. Data center owners, managers, or their designees shall, following guidance from the campus Information Security Officer, ensure that data center facilities under their responsibility have adequate physical security safeguards. These safeguards may include: physical barriers (e.g., walls, gates, locked doors), access controls (e.g., identification cards, visitor escorts and logs, facility\/equipment repair records), environmental controls and protections (e.g., uninterruptible power supplies, generators, temperature and humidity systems, fire suppression units).\nIT resources. IT service providers shall ensure that all IT resources under their responsibility have adequate physical security safeguards. While the value of these IT resources may not rise to that found in a data center, the physical protections normally afforded to IT resources within a data center should be employed where reasonable and appropriate.\n\nIncident Detection and Reporting\n\nIT service providers shall monitor for and report security breaches or other significant security events involving the IT resources under their control, following guidance from the campus Information Security Officer.\n\nIII.

Once such an appointment has been made, subsequent decisions on the salary, promotion, and all perquisites and benefits for the employee must be made by someone other than the immediate family member, even though the immediate family member may be the supervisor to whom the employee reports. The immediate family member in the supervisory position shall recuse her or himself from all personnel actions involving the other immediate family member.\nThis administrative policy statement requires that procedures be developed for identifying and reporting potential conflicts of interest in employment where a supervisory relationship exists between immediate family members. Each campus is responsible for developing procedures for reporting supervisory relationships between immediate family members and taking actions to ensure that the immediate family member in the supervisory position is not involved in any personnel actions, as described above, involving the subordinate immediate family member.\nIII.

By quality: No matter what the amount, an item is material if the misstatement or omission makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person, who was relying on the information to make a decision or to take an action, would be changed or influenced.(whether resolved or unresolved) issues of noncompliance; inappropriate reporting of financial information; questioned costs; or allegations of fraud or suspected fraud.\nEnsuring that all access granted to financial information is in accordance with University policies.2\nEnsuring their own delegated approval authority is used properly.\nThe Financial Report Review Process serves as the only way fraud, errors, and omissions may be detected for some transactions.

POLICY STATEMENT\n\nParental Leave Benefits by Employment Classification\n\n\tThe provisions of this University Parental Leave Policy are intended to be interpreted in conjunction with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)FMLASee Section III. Definitions. Parental leave and FMLA shall run concurrently.\u00a0 Thus, leave taken under the Parental Leave Policy counts as part of, and is not in addition to, the twelve weeks of leave guaranteed by the FMLA.\n\t\nNine-Month Faculty\n\t\t\nTenured and Tenure-Track Faculty\n\n\t\t\tFaculty on nine-month appointments do not accrue vacation leave. \u00a0Accordingly, tenured and tenure-track nine-month faculty are entitled to eighteen weeks of\u00a0 leave to provide care for the faculty member's childChildSee Section III. Definitions within twelve months of the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of the child, during which period the faculty member may use accrued sick leave.\n\n\t\t\tIf the faculty member exhausts all sick leave before the end of the eighteen-week period, then the faculty member may continue the leave for the remainder of the period at half pay with full benefits.\nOther Nine-Month Faculty\n\n\t\t\tOther Nine-Month Faculty on nine-month appointments shall receive the same benefit listed in Section II.A.1.a on the same terms as tenured and tenure-track faculty on nine-month appointments.\n\nUniversity Staff\n\n\t\tUniversity staff are entitled to six consecutive months of unpaid parental leave if the eligibility in Section II.B.2.b is met, and unpaid FMLA during which time they may receive pay by using any combination and adhering to the rules of the following leave programs:\n\t\t\nUniversity paid parental leave benefit (see section II.B.2),\nAccrued sick leave,\nAccrued vacation leave,\nShort-term disability for birth parent only (optional plan, paid for by employee).\n\n\t\t\tAll parental leave is granted to care for the university staff member\u2019s child within twelve months of the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\u00a0 The university staff member shall inform the appropriate supervisor as early as possible of the intent to use parental leave.\n\nTwelve-Month Faculty (including Research Faculty)\n\n\t\tTwelve-month faculty shall be entitled to the same amount of parental leave as university staff.\u00a0\nClassified Staff\n\n\t\tClassified staff parents are entitled to 13 weeks of unpaid FMLA governed by the State of Colorado Personnel rules, during which time they may receive pay by using any combination and adhering to the rules of the following leave programs:\u00a0\n\t\t\nAccrued sick leave,\nAccrued vacation leave,\nShort-term disability for birth parent only (mandatory plan, paid for by the university).\n\n\t\t\tFML for parental leave is granted to care for the classified staff member\u2019s child within twelve months of the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\u00a0 The classified staff member shall inform the appropriate supervisor as early as possible of the intent to use parental leave.\n\n\nParental Leave Components\n\t\nFamily Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for Parental Leave\n\n\t\tThe FMLA is a federal law that guarantees certain workers 12 weeks per year of unpaid leave to attend to certain family and medical needs, including a child\u2019s birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\n\n\t\tThe campus and system human resources offices shall inform all employees who are covered by the FMLA of their FMLA rights regarding leave for pregnancy or for the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child, and shall administer FMLA leave in accordance with federal law.\nUniversity Paid Parental Leave Benefit Program\n\t\t\nThe university grants 160 hours (4 weeks) of paid parental leave, prorated for percent of time if appointment is less than 100%, to eligible employees (see Section II.B.2.b) and can be taken and completed within one year of the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\n\t\t\t\nThere is no cash value for paid parental leave upon termination or separation from the university and leave cannot be rolled forward for future use.\nUniversity paid parental leave is to be taken consecutively unless a campus policy allows otherwise.\nUniversity paid parental leave is calculated on the employee\u2019s base salary only and is subject to taxes and withholdings.\nThe university paid parental leave program is effective for eligible employees of children born, adopted, placed in foster care or guardianship on or after July 1, 2018, unless a campus policy allows otherwise.\n\nEligibility for University Paid Parental Leave Program\n\t\t\t\nA regular twelve-month faculty member or university staff member is eligible for paid parental leave if the employee has worked for 12 consecutive months in a 50% or greater appointment at the university immediately prior to the date of birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\u00a0\nA regular twelve-month faculty member or university staff member must have a regular appointment of 50% or greater on the date of birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child to be eligible for paid parental leave.\n\n\nAlternative Leave for Birth, Adoption, Foster Care Placement or Guardianship of a Child\n\n\t\tAny faculty or staff member who does not wish to take the standard leave described in Section II.A may negotiate an alternative leave arrangement with his or her supervisor or primary unit chair. \u00a0For example: \u00a0using the six-month unpaid parental leave intermittently, alternative work schedules, differentiated workloads, banked courses, etc.\n\n\t\tThe decision whether to grant such a negotiated leave arrangement shall be dictated by the needs of the unit, in the discretion of the supervisor or unit chair and in consultation with the human resources office to ensure that the decision is consistent with the FMLA. \u00a0Negotiated leave arrangements must be in writing, and, in the case of a staff member, signed by the staff member and supervisor; or, in the case of a faculty member, by the faculty member, chair, and dean.\nRight to Request Other Unpaid Parental Leave\n\n\t\tFor purposes of caring for their minor child(ren) of any age, faculty members and university staff may request parental leave without pay, or reduced loads at reduced pay, up to a total of 32 weeks for 9-month faculty or twelve months for university staff and 12-month faculty. \u00a0This maximum of 32 weeks or twelve months of parental leave includes, and is not in addition to, any leave taken under Section II.A\u00a0of this policy or leave taken under the FMLA. \u00a0The supervisor has discretion whether to grant such requests for parental leave or schedule modifications beyond those guaranteed by Section II.A\u00a0or by the FMLA.\n\nTenure Probationary Period for Tenure-Track Faculty\n\n\tConsistent with Article 5.B.4 (D) of the Laws of the Regents, leave taken pursuant to this policy, including a negotiated alternative leave, does not count as part of the tenure probationary period. \u00a0Parental leave results in a \"stop\" on the tenure clock; such \"stops\" must be taken in one-year increments. \u00a0However, a faculty member may irrevocably elect, no later than six months following his or her return to full-time service, to have the leave time count as part of the tenure probationary period. \u00a0Such an election shall be made in writing and must be approved by the dean and the chancellor.\n\n\tA faculty member who has experienced the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child, but who does not take parental leave, may also irrevocably elect to stop the tenure clock for one year, provided the election is made in writing within six months of the child\u2019s birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\n\n\tAbsent extraordinary circumstances, a maximum of two \"stops\" on the tenure clock for parental leave is allowed under this policy.\nSimultaneous Leave\n\n\tIf both parents are employed by the University of Colorado and both are eligible for any parental leave benefit described under this policy, paid and unpaid leaves under this policy may be taken simultaneously or may be staggered within 12 months of a child\u2019s birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\nCampus Parental Leave Policies\n\t\nA campus may adopt a campus specific policy provided that the approved policy is referenced in section IV of this APS and the Office of University Counsel reviews any alternate policy.\n\t\t\nA campus may provide additional parental leave benefits to its employees or to a group of its employees that are more generous than those provided by Section II.A.1 or Section II.A.2 of this APS.\nA campus may alter the benefit for all twelve-month faculty or to specified categories of twelve-month faculty as provided in Section II.A.3.\n\n\n\nIII. DEFINITIONS\n\nFMLA \u2013 The Family Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., a federal law which guarantees unpaid, job protected leave for certain employees experiencing qualifying family and medical circumstances, including the birth, adoption, foster care placement or guardianship of a child.\n\nChild \u2013 A biological, adopted, foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who is either under 18 years of age or is 18 years of age or older and \u201cincapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability\u201d at the time leave is to commence.\n\nParent \u2013 A biological parent, adoptive parent, foster parent, guardian or a spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner of a parent, including an employee using a surrogate\/gestational carrier.\nIV.

Policy Statement\n\n\nThe University\u2019s Mission\n\nRegent Law 1.C articulates the University\u2019s mission as follows: \u201cThe University of Colorado is a public research university with multiple campuses serving Colorado, the nation, and the world through leadership in high-quality education and professional training, public service, advancing research and knowledge, and state-of-the-art health care. Each campus has a distinct role and mission as provided by Colorado law.\u201d\n\t\u00a0\nThe University\u2019s Values and Ethical Commitment\n\n\tAs members of the University of Colorado community, all employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. are responsible for sustaining the highest ethical standards of this institution. As articulated in Regent Policy 1.B, the University of Colorado values ethical behavior, integrity, transparency, and accountability, and strives to integrate these values into its operations.\nPurpose of the Code of Conduct\n\n\tThe University of Colorado must earn and maintain a reputation for integrity that includes, but is not limited to, compliance with laws and regulations and with its contractual obligations. The Laws of the Regents Article 1, Part D, makes members of the university community responsible for understanding and upholding the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct. The Board of Regents promulgated Regent Policy 1.C \u2013 Principles of Ethical Behavior to set forth broad ethical expectations for the University of Colorado community.\n\n\tThis Code of Conduct is intended to: (i) implement Article 1 of the Laws of the Regents and Regent Policy 1.C; (ii) further define the expectations for University employees; and (iii) provide guidance on the resources available to guide ethical behavior. This Code identifies system-level policies that directly implement the Principles of Ethical Behavior, but this Code is not an exhaustive or comprehensive collection of all policies that effectuate these Principles. The system administration and the administration of each campus, schools, colleges, and departments have all adopted additional policies that complement and effectuate these principles. Each university employee bears responsibility to familiarize himself or herself with all policies applicable to his or her position.\n\t\u00a0\nCode of Conduct\n\nResponsible Conduct\n\n\t\tUniversity of Colorado employees are expected to conduct themselves ethically, and in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and university policies. University employees are expected to practice and model ethical and responsible behavior in all aspects of their work. Expected conduct includes conducting fair and principled business transactions; acting in good faith; being personally accountable for individual actions; conscientiously fulfilling obligations towards others; and communicating ethical standards of conduct through instruction and example (Regent Policy 1.C.1).\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\n\u200bThe University demonstrates its commitment to responsible conduct beginning during the hiring process, and through multiple statements of expected conduct in the workplace. University employees are subject to background checks upon receiving an offer of employment, pursuant to APS 5050 - Background Checks, and as a condition of their offers of employment, must agree to comply with university laws and policies and with state and federal laws.\u00a0 During their employment, University employees must follow administrative policy statement APS 4016 - Fiscal Code of Ethics and are subject to controls on their expenditure of university funds.1\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nRespect for Others\n\n\t\tThe University of Colorado recognizes that people are the most important resource in accomplishing its mission in the areas of teaching, research, community service, and patient care. The University of Colorado values academic freedom, diversity, and respect for all persons. The university is committed to the principle of non-discrimination and does not tolerate harassment on any basis, including sex, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, political affiliation, or political philosophy. University employees are expected to treat colleagues, co-workers, and studentsStudentAny individual who applies to, is accepted for admission, and enrolls for a course at the University of Colorado. This does not include an individual who has never attended or never enrolled at the institution.2 with respect, professionalism, and dignity in all interactions and communications (Regent Policy 1.C.2).\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\nThe Regents have enshrined the principles of academic freedom and non-discrimination in Regent Law 5.D and Regent Law 10.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe university has adopted APS 5001 - Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action to ensure compliance with its commitment to equal opportunity and affirmative action. Additionally, the University has adopted APS 5014 \u2013 Sexual Misconduct to ensure that its students and employees can realize their educational and professional aspirations free from sex discrimination.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\n\t\tAs a state institution, it is imperative for both legal and ethical reasons that university employees do not improperly benefit from their positions of trust at the university. University employees are expected to avoid actual and perceived conflicts of interest related to their work and position. Actual or potential conflicts must be appropriately disclosed in accordance with university conflict of interest and conflict of commitment policies, so that such conflicts may be reviewed, and as appropriate, managed or eliminated. To avoid such conflicts, employees are responsible for seeking appropriate guidance.\n\n\t\tConflicts of interest may also arise in the context of gifts, travel, and entertainment. University employees are expected to conduct themselves so as to ensure that their positions are not misused for private gain with respect to the acceptance of gifts and the undertaking of university-related travel or entertainment. University employees may not solicit, accept, or agree to accept any benefit that is intended to influence the employee in the performance of his or her university duties (Regent Policy 1.C.3).\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\nThe Regents have adopted Regent Policy 2A to ensure that individual Regents fulfill their fiduciary obligations, serve the public trust and not allow personal or financial interests to impair their decisions in the university\u2019s interest.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nThe Regents have also acted to ensure that officers and university staff act in the university\u2019s best interest and that they disclose their outside interests per Regent Policy 3.B.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nConflicts of interest may also occur as a result of interpersonal relationships. To address these possibilities, the University has also adopted\u200b APS 5003 - Nepotism in Employment and APS 5015 - Conflict of Interest in Cases of Amorous Relationships, that govern disclosure and management of amorous relationships and of nepotism in hiring and supervision.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nUniversity employees and students engaged in research are subject to APS 5012 - Conflicts of Interest and Commitment which requires that each campus adopt a process by which the university\u2019s researchers disclose their outside financial interests.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nSome campuses, schools and colleges within the University of Colorado System have developed additional conflict-of-interest policies addressing interactions with industry, receipt of gifts, meals, paid travel or pharmaceutical samples, disclosures of financial ties, ghost writing and speaking engagements. Employees, students and other learners and staff members are expected to understand and comply with these additional obligations.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nResearch and Academic Integrity\n\n\t\tAs members of a premier research university, employees have significant responsibility to ensure that research and academic work is conducted with the highest integrity, and in compliance with federal and state laws, and university policies. Academic freedom can flourish only in a community that values intellectual integrity. University of Colorado researchers and scholars are expected to protect people and humanely treat animals involved in research or teaching; and follow and demonstrate accountability for sponsors and regulatory body requirements. In addition, all members of the university community are to ensure originality of work, accurately and fairly publish information, and fairly assign authorship credit on the basis of intellectual contributions (Regent Policy 1.C.4).\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\nRegent Law 5.D.2 provides that faculty members have the responsibility to: \u201cmaintain competence, exert themselves to the limit of their intellectual capacities in scholarship, research, writing, and speaking; and to act on and off the campus with integrity and in accordance with the highest standards of their profession.\u201d\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nResearch and academic integrity are core university values, and the University has implemented robust compliance programs to actuate them. The University has adopted APS 5012 - Conflicts of Interest and Commitment to govern researcher\u2019s disclosures of outside interests. Each campus also has a policy describing campus processes for collecting such information. APS 1007 - Misconduct in Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activities articulates expectations regarding research integrity and establishes the role of a Research Integrity Officer on each campus. Accordingly, each campus has a policy on research integrity, and a process for investigating allegations of research misconduct.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nEach campus also has an academic honor code regarding expectations of integrity in student work.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nStewardship of University Property\n\n\t\tThe university is committed to responsible stewardship of university resourcesUniversity resourcesOfficial resources of the institution, including but not limited to: university funds, facilities, personnel\/labor, equipment (e.g., telephones, photocopy machines, computers \u2013 including email), work products, results, materials, records, or other information developed or produced with university goods or services., and employees are expected to ensure that university property, funds, and technology are used and disposed of appropriately. These responsibilities include using and disposing of university property, equipment, and resources only for legitimate university purposes; promoting efficient operations; following sound financial practices; and engaging in appropriate accounting and monitoring.\n\n\t\tUniversity property includes the university seal, name, and logo. The university regulates the use of its seal, name and related trademarks and logos in order to protect the university's reputation and to ensure that their use is related to the University's educational, research, community service, and patient care missions (Regent Policy 1.C.5).\n\nUniversity Property\n\n\t\t\u2022\u00a0Pursuant to Regent Law Article 14.B.3, the Chancellor of each campus shall adopt procedures and regulations governing the use of university facilities on each campus.\n\nUniversity Brand\n\n\t\t\u2022\u00a0Stewardship of the University\u2019s brand and trademarks are addressed in multiple policies, including APS 2025 - University Brand Identity and Logo Usage, APS 2026 \u2013 University Trademarks, Trade Names and Service Marks, and Regent Law 2.C on the University Seal, and Regent Law 14.B on use of the University\u2019s name in advertising.\n\nUniversity Funds\n\n\t\t\u2022\u00a0The University has vested authority for university financial accounts with the Treasurer, and has provided in APS 4004 - Bank Account and Investment Account Restrictions that only the Treasurer can hold such accounts in the University\u2019s name.\n\n\t\t\u2022\u00a0The University Controller has adopted fiscal procedures to govern the expenditure of University fundsUniversity fundsAll funds appropriated, generated, awarded, donated or otherwise received by the University regardless of their source.

Official Functions do not include student residential functions, which are defined as events designed to sustain ordinary residential life activities, such as resident hall advisory meetings and resident hall events. Conferences and Fundraising Events are types of official functions separately defined by the university to recognize the need for specific policies and procedures related to those types of events. The following describe the most common types of official functions. \u2022 Training functions are held to enhance staff knowledge or to educate employees, associates, or other individuals that are affected by the university's operations or regulations. Note: Training functions should have a written agenda, study materials, and be led by an identified presenter(s). \u2022 Community relation functions are hosted on behalf of external entities, or are activities directly related to the educational, research, or public service mission of the university. \u2022 Employee recognition functions are held for the purpose of acknowledging, appreciating, or honoring employees as a means of providing an encouraging and supportive work environment. \u2022 Goodwill functions are held to express condolence, sympathy, get-well wishes, celebrations of birth, or presentation of official items to official guests or volunteers as an indication of goodwill or esteem. \u2022 Multi-unit or multi-campus functions are infrequent events or meetings involving associates or employees from more than one organizational unit or campus. \u2022 Recruitment functions are held to enlist new employees, including faculty or post\/pre-doctorates. \u2022 Retirement functions are held to honor departing or retiring faculty or staff members for their university service. \u2022 Student functions are hosted for students and are directly related to student or educational development. Examples include student recognition, student recruitment, and student program development.\u200b: The purchase of alcoholic beverages shall only be made using gift funds (Fund 34) that are restricted for entertainment, donor cultivation, or personnel recruitment purposes. The purchase must be approved by the Vice President\/Vice Chancellor for Finance or his\/her delegate(s). See specific restrictions on development activities, below.\u00a0\nFor development activities:\n\nThe purchase of alcoholic beverages shall only be made using development\/advancement funds (Fund 36) or gift funds (Fund 34) that are restricted for entertainment, donor cultivation, or personnel recruitment purposes.\nThe purchase must be approved by the Vice President\/Vice Chancellor for Advancement or his\/her delegate(s).\nIf the purchase originates by non-development staff, the purchase will also be approved by the Vice President\/Vice Chancellor for Finance or his\/her delegate.\n\t\t\tNote: Development activities include both donor cultivation, solicitation, and stewardship events and fundraising eventsFundraising eventAn event at which a required monetary payment to attend or participate includes both a gift component (charitable contribution) and a non-gift component (goods and\/or services are provided or available to the attendees, sponsors, or donors). A fundraising event will most often be completed in a single day; however, the event may consist of a multi-day, singularly identifiable event, such as a trip or cultural celebration weekend. This type of event differs from a conference in that some portion of the attendees' payment is intended to be tax deductible. Examples of fundraising events include the collection of gifts or money through sale or auction of merchandise or services, collection of registration or sponsorship fees with a promise of a tax deduction, imposition of admission charges or registration fees with a promise of a tax deduction, and\/or membership fees..\n\nFor CU-sponsored\u00a0conferencesConferenceAn auxiliary activity to conduct a formal meeting of a number of people, primarily other than employees or associates, for discussion or consultation on a serious and identified topic, where admission is charged to those attending. Unlike the admission fee for a fundraising event,the admission fee for a conference is not intended to be tax-deductible, either in total or in part. Conferences are accounted for in Funds 20 or 29 in the Finance System.\u200b:\u00a0The purchase of alcoholic beverages should be made using auxiliary funds (Fund 20 or Fund 29) received through conference registration fees. Gift funds with the appropriate designation (Fund 34 and restricted for entertainment, donor cultivation, or personnel recruitment purposes) may also be used. The purchase must be approved by the appropriate individual(s) within the\u00a0organizational unit.\n\nUniversity fundsUniversity fundsAll funds appropriated, generated, awarded, donated or otherwise received by the University regardless of their source.

Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Members in a Probationary Period\nIndividual faculty members hired into positions for which there is a mandatory evaluation period followed by a decision to continue or terminate the appointment shall be provided with mentoring opportunitiesMentoring OpportunitiesSee Section III. Definitions. relative to the standards of performance required for reappointment, tenure and\/or promotion.\n\n\nCriteria for Tenure and\/or Promotion\n\n\t\t\tAt the time of hire, faculty members must be provided with the university's standards and procedures for tenure and\/or promotion, including the primary unit\u2019s published criteria for tenure and promotion and a timeline for the review process. In addition to published policies and guidelines, schools and colleges shall provide their faculty members reasonable opportunities for training and information sessions on the tenure and promotion process.\n\nMentoring\n\n\t\t\tPrimary units shall ensure that reasonable mentoring opportunities are available for faculty members during their probationary period. However, in some cases, it may make more sense for the campus\u2019s faculty development office or a school or college to take responsibility for providing mentoring opportunities. Together, the dean and faculty of each school\/college shall determine whether to have unit-based mentoring or campus\/school\/college-based mentoring.\n\n\t\t\tDepartment chairs\/unit heads have the responsibility to assist any faculty member who requests a mentorMentorSee Section III. Definitions. during his\/her probationary period to locate an appropriate mentor on the campus. In some units, it may be helpful to identify an external mentor from another CU campus or from outside the university. External assistance, however, cannot be assured. If the mentoring program is formal, the frequency and general subjects of the mentoring sessions should be documented.\n\n\t\t\tWhile the primary unit (or school\/college, if not the primary unit) has a responsibility to provide reasonable mentoring opportunities, faculty members should proactively seek mentoring assistance.\n\n\t\t\tFaculty members who believe they are not getting adequate mentoring are responsible for bringing their situation to the attention of the unit head. If they are not satisfied with the mentoring opportunities the unit head provides, they should bring this concern to the attention of the dean or the provost\u2019s office.\n\n\t\t\tFaculty members who serve as mentors should be able to count mentoring activities in the annual merit evaluation process.\n\nAdvising on Progress toward Reappointment, Tenure and\/or Promotion\n\n\t\t\tFaculty members receive specific feedback on their progress toward tenure and\/or promotion at the Comprehensive Review (leading to reappointment, usually in the fourth year). They may also request additional feedback from the primary unit head in the second and any subsequent year prior to the tenure and\/or promotion decision (except the academic year in which the Comprehensive Review is undertaken). In this additional feedback process, the primary unit head shall examine evidence provided by the candidate of the candidate's teaching, research\/creative work, clinical activity, and leadership and service and make suggestions for improvement in those areas where the record should be stronger. These suggestions are not intended to provide the level of specific formal feedback that is provided through the Comprehensive Review. The primary unit head may recommend that the candidate work with senior faculty members and\/or with a campus office of faculty development. If the candidate elects these advising sessions, the candidate shall report this fact in the annual report of professional activity (FRPA), but the content of these consultations shall remain confidential unless the faculty member elects otherwise.\n\n\nOther Faculty Members\n\n\t\tUnits are encouraged, but not required, to extend mentoring opportunities to other faculty as resources allow.\n\n\nIII. Definitions\n\nA mentor is an individual who provides career development counseling, either formally or informally, to assist a faculty member.\nMentoring opportunity(ies) refers to a range of professional assistance provided to faculty on such subjects as the tenure and promotion process, teaching, publishing, creative work, research, grants, etc.\nIV.

Therefore, the University will post and maintain tenure policies and procedures on the system website; campuses will post and maintain tenure policies and campus procedures on the individual campus websites.\n\n\tIn order to make the tenure process more understandable to the public, the system website will also provide a definition and history of tenure and will post and update relevant statistics on tenure as they are reported to the Board of Regents.\n\t\u00a0\nPeriodic Review and Public Reporting on Tenure Related Policies and Procedures\n\n\n\n\nTen Year Review\n\n\t\tEvery 10 years, the University shall undertake a review of its tenure policies and procedures. This review will be an opportunity to assess the overall effectiveness of the tenure process and its results. The Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Faculty Council, campus representatives, and representatives of the schools and colleges will conduct this review.\u00a0 Campus findings shall be reported to the Board of Regents and best practices identified in this review shall be disseminated to all campuses. \u00a0In the following year, the Provost shall report on the adoption of relevant best practices .\n\t\t\u00a0\nData Collection\n\n\t\tThe following data will be collected on each cohort of tenure track faculty:\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\nThe numbers of applicants in the original hiring pool,\nThe number of faculty members who leave the institution (and the reasons if known),\nThe number of faculty members who come up for tenure earlier than the usual probationary period, and\nThe number of faculty members granted or denied tenure\n\n\t\t\tWhenever possible, exit interviews shall be conducted by the Human Resources Office.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nRandom \"Audit\" or Examination\n\n\t\tTo ensure tenure policies are being followed, a random \"audit\" or examination of tenure case files from across the system shall be undertaken at least every five years. The audit will focus on how well tenure processes have been followed and whether there are ambiguities or problems with the process that should be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A summary of audit findings shall be reported to the Board of Regents.\u00a0 The President or the Chancellor (if limited to a campus) may require a similar analysis of the post-tenure review process.\n\t\t\u00a0\nCreating Consistency of Practice\n\n\t\tWhen procedural issues arise during a tenure review and there is no specific policy guidance to address the issue it should be reported to the Provost.\u00a0 The Provost shall consult with the Vice President for Academic Affairs to establish a correct practice. If the gap in process appears with some regularity, system administration shall work with faculty governance to revise procedures to address this gap.\n\n\nIII. \u00a0 Related Policies, Procedures,

Definitions are held in the name of the Regents of the University of Colorado, a body corporate. Oversight over the portfolio of\u00a0 university marks ultimately resides with the Secretary of the Board of Regents, and the university president, as principal executive officer, is responsible for maintenance, development and protection of the portfolio, as well as the licensing and commercialization of university marks, which authority is jointly delegated by this policy to the Associate Director for Trademarks (\u201cthe Associate Director\u201d), Office of University Counsel and Boulder Campus Licensing Program Office (\u201cthe Boulder Licensing Program\u201d), Boulder Athletics Department1.\n\t\u00a0\nRegistration and Protection of University MarksUniversity marksSee Section III. Definitions\n\nRegistration of University Marks\n\n\t\tThe university has registered many marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), some of which are valuable assets for the university. Any university unit that wishes to register a new university mark shall consult with the Associate Director to discuss the value and necessity of federally registering such mark.\u00a0 The University Branding Committee shall consider whether a particular mark complies with the University Brand Identity Standards, before the unit proceeds with a trademark application.\n\n\t\tAmong the factors that should be considered before registering a new mark are:\n\t\t\nThe cost of registration;\nThe value of the mark and of federal registration thereof;\nThe possibility of confusion with another entity\u2019s marks;\nEnforceability of the mark;\nThe consistency of the mark with the university\u2019s Branding Guidelines.\n\n\t\t\tThe Associate Director is responsible for initial trademark registration with USPTO, including any necessary engagement with outside counsel and making any required filings. \u00a0Generally, where a university unit decides to proceed with federal registration, that unit shall be responsible for costs associated with registration.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nMaintenance of the Portfolio of University Marks\n\n\t\tThe Associate Director is responsible for maintenance of the portfolio of university marks.\n\t\t\u00a0\nEnforcement of the University\u2019s Rights in University Marks\n\n\t\tAll use of university marks must comply with the terms of this Administrative Policy Statement and non-university parties shall not use university marks without express permission of either the university or its authorized licensing agentLicensing agentSee Section III. Definitions\u200b. Use of the university's marks for commercial purposes without the prior written consent of the university may constitute trademark infringement, trademark dilution and unfair competition in violation of federal and state laws.\n\n\t\tUpon discovery of an unauthorized usage of a university mark, the Associate Director shall work with either the Office of University Counsel or the Boulder Licensing Program to notify the unauthorized user that it must cease and desist in the unauthorized usage of the university's marks. Should the unauthorized use not be discontinued, the University shall consider all appropriate legal action.\n\t\t\u00a0\nClaims Regarding Marks\n\n\t\tAll disputes about use or enforcement of the marks, or claims regarding the University\u2019s use of another party\u2019s marks, shall be directed to the Vice President, University Counsel and Secretary of the Board of Regents.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nCommercialization of the University's MarksUniversity marksSee Section III. Definitions\n\n\tIn entering licensing agreements governing its marks, the university\u2019s primary objectives are to safeguard the marks and to enhance the image of the university through the approved use of the marks by licensees who adhere to university standards.\n\n\tThe university shall collect a fair and competitive royalty for any licensed university marks.\n\n\tAny licensing agreements shall require licensees, and their contractors, vendors, and manufacturers, to adhere to ethical business practices as well as standards related to quality, reliability and cost.\u00a0 Licensing agreements shall incorporate mechanisms to enforce compliance with those standards.\n\n\tUniversity units may only purchase goods incorporating university marks from authorized vendors who have\u00a0received appropriate approval from the university\u2019s licensing agent. The University should not be required to pay itself for purchases of services or products it makes for its own use to fulfill the educational mission of the university. Goods and services purchased by university departments for their use within the institution are exempt from royalties but such goods must be purchased from licensed manufacturers and service providers.\n\t\u00a0\nUse of University MarksUniversity marksSee Section III. Definitions by Student Organizations\n\n\tEach campus shall adopt a policy or implement a process to govern review and approval of student organization requests to use university marks identified with that campus.\n\n\tStudent organizations seeking to use a university mark identified with the system as a whole (e.g., the unofficial seal or the interlocking CU) shall seek approval from the Associate Director.\n\t\u00a0\nUse of University MarksUniversity marksSee Section III. Definitions for Promotion\n\nRegent Policy 14.B prohibits the use of the university\u2019s name in advertising that involves product endorsement.\n\n\tThe authority to approve the use of the university\u2019s name in other advertising is hereby delegated to the Boulder Licensing Program, which may delegate all or part of that authority to the Associate Director.\n\nIII.

For certain expenses, such as routine procurement card purchases, it is reasonable to conduct the approval process after the transaction has been completed. For others, such as a purchase exceeding $5,000, the approval must be done prior to incurring the expense. Whether the approval process is done before or after the transaction has been completed, it consists of the following four steps:\n\nThe approver initially considers the\u00a0Tests of Propriety\u00a0(See Section II.E) presented in this policy, policies set forth in other Administrative Policy Statements, and\u00a0Procurement Service Center Procedural Statements\u00a0to evaluate whether or not the transaction is a proper expense of University funds.\nThe approver next evaluates the expense for propriety with respect to other applicable policies, laws, regulations, and rules; and contracts, grants, and donor restrictions. The approver also evaluates the expense in terms of campus-specific or organizational unitOrganizational unitA subset of University operations. An Organizational Unit may be a department or any other distinct operational activity with the following characteristics: \u2022 Organizational permanency; \u2022 Programmatic autonomy; and \u2022 An annual operating budget that is fiscally independent. Within the Finance System, these areas are represented on the ChartField tree as Orgs.-specific rules.\nThe approver is expected to challenge any transaction that does not appear to be an appropriate expenditure of University funds.\nIf the approver is uncertain that the propriety of the expense has been substantiated, the approver must refer the matter to the next higher level Fiscal RoleFiscal roleThe categorization of Employees to indicate their fiscal responsibilities to the University as defined in Administrative Policy Statement Fiscal Roles and Responsibilities. Categories include Officers, Fiscal Principals, Fiscal Managers and Fiscal Staff. (as defined in the hierarchy set forth in the Administrative Policy Statement\u00a0Fiscal Roles and Responsibilities) for further evaluation and approval.\n\nPersonal Responsibility\n\n\tAs indicated in the Administrative Policy Statement\u00a0Fiscal Roles and Responsibilities, the individuals involved in a transaction may be held personally liable for a transaction that is made in violation of policies, laws, regulations, and rules and contracts, grants and donor restrictions, regardless of when the approval occurred.\n\nEmployeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly., associatesAssociateAn individual who is not employed by the University, but who is actively involved in furthering the University's mission in some fashion.

The list below contains a series of questions designed to test the propriety of expenses by forming a framework for evaulating each transaction. An expenditure of university funds will be considered proper only if it meets all tests of propriety. Is this transaction: 1. For official university business? 2. In the best interests of the university? 3. The most effective way to accomplish official university business? Meaning that, without the expense, would programmatic objectives be difficult or otherwise more costly to achieve? Or would the impact, level, or quality of the achievement be reduced? 4. In compliance with applicable policies, laws, regulations, and rules; and contracts, grants, and donor restrictions including having the required approvals and authorizations by the appropriate fiscal role? Consult with the campus Controller for questions about whether or not a transaction is in compliance and with the Administrative Policy Statement \"Fiscal Roles and Responsibilities\" for information on fiscal roles. 5. Within the available resources of the responsibility unit, taking into consideration all outstanding commitments and encumbrances? 6. Directly beneficial to the responsibility unit where it is being charged? 7. Reasonable? Meaning that the quantity and quality of goods or services being purchased is sufficient to meet the university's identified need without exceeding it. 8. In compliance with university conflict of interest provisions? Meaning that, if an employee derives private gain, or appears to derive private gain, as a result of the transaction, then the transaction violates the conflict of interest provisions stated in Regent Law, Regent Policy, and in the Administrative Policy Statement, \"Conflict of Interest Policy.\" If any of these questions receives a \"no\" response, then the expense is not appropriate for university funds. Evaluating the propriety of university expenses requires the exercise of a high degree of judgment and discernment. Therefore, consider the following when deciding whether or not a particular transaction is a proper use of university funds. \u2022 \"Would a university outsider such as your dentist, a teacher at the local elementary school, the clerk at your grocery store, or your neighbor \u2013 consider the expenditure to be a reasonable and necessary expense of public funds? \u2022 \"Would you want others such as newspaper, radio, television, or other media outlets knowing and reporting about the expenditure?\" Think about whether an outsider, such as the general public or an auditor, would consider the expenditure a reasonable expense for university business and an appropriate use of university funds. are used to evaluate the appropriateness of an expenditure.\u00a0 In order for an expenditure to be considered an appropriate use of University fundsUniversity fundsAll funds appropriated, generated, awarded, donated or otherwise received by the University regardless of their source.

This does not include an individual who has never attended or never enrolled at the institution., faculty, staff, contractors, patients, volunteers, affiliatedAffiliateAn organization that has a contractual or other legal relationship with the University that closely aligns them operationally with the University to more effectively further both the University and the organization's missions.

Affiliates include Blended Organizations and Supporting Organizations. entities and other third parties, regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression or gender identity. Any violations may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including, expulsion or termination of employment, as applicable.\u00a0 The University will consider what appropriate potential actions should be taken, including contract termination and\/or property exclusion, regarding third party conduct that is alleged to have violated this policy; however those options may be limited depending on the circumstances of the arrangement.\n\nThis prohibition applies to conduct that occurs on campus.\u00a0\u00a0 It also applies to off campus conduct, including on-line or electronic conduct, if the conduct (1) occurred in the context of an employment or education program or activity of the University or (2) has continuing adverse effects on campus.\n\nThe University takes prompt and effective steps reasonably intended to stop any form of sexual misconduct, eliminate any hostile environment, prevent its recurrence and as appropriate, remedy its effects.\nB. \u00a0Options for Reporting and Assistance Following an Incident of Sexual Misconduct\nWhen a student, faculty or staff member reports that they have experienced sexual misconduct, whether it occurred on or off campus, the campus shall provide them with written notification of the following:\n\nReporting rights and options, including to whom and how they should report an alleged offense, including\u00a0law enforcement authorities (any on-campus and local police) and to be assisted by campus authorities in doing so, but also of their option to decline to notify such authorities;\nThe importance of preserving evidence that may assist in proving that the alleged criminal offense occurred or may be helpful in obtaining a protection order;\nResponsibilities for orders of protection, no-contact orders, restraining orders or similar lawful orders issued by a criminal, civil or tribal court or by the campus;\nCounseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, legal assistance, visa and immigration assistance, availability of forensic nurses to administer forensic sexual assault nurse exams (\u201cSANE\u201d) and other services available for victims within the campus and in the community; and\nOptions for, and available assistance in, changing transportation and working situations, in addition to any available academic and residential accommodations. This notification shall be made and accommodations afforded if they are reasonably available, regardless of whether the person who experienced sexual misconduct chooses to participate in any campus investigation or disciplinary proceeding or report the crime to law enforcement.\n\nReporting Options and Assistance:\n\nCU Boulder\nUCCS\nCU Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus\nCU System Administration\n\nC. \u00a0Responsible Employees Must Report Sexual Misconduct\n\nAny faculty or staff member who is considered a responsible employeeResponsible employeeSee Section III. Definitions\u200b, as defined in Section III, who witnesses or receives information regarding any possible sexual misconduct prohibited herein is required to promptly report to the Title IX Coordinator or designee all known details about the alleged sexual misconduct, including:\n\nName of the alleged victim;\nName of alleged perpetrator;\nName of any alleged witnesses; and\nAny other relevant facts, including the date, time and specific location of the alleged incident.\n\nAll individuals, even if not considered a responsible employee, are highly encouraged to promptly report such information to a responsible employee or directly to the Title IX Coordinator or designee.\n\nReports, complaints and other information must be provided in good faith.\u00a0 It is a violation of this policy when a person knowingly or recklessly alleges a false complaint of sexual misconduct or provides false information during the course of an investigation, and violators may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion or termination of employment, as applicable. \u00a0This provision does not apply to reports made or information provided in good faith, even if the facts alleged in the report are not later substantiated.\nD. \u00a0Confidential Resources and Privacy\n\nThe University supports the use of Confidential Resources so that victims of sexual misconduct can report such misconduct confidentially\u00a0and receive support and accommodations as necessary through the Title IX Coordinator or designee.\u00a0 Communications with these confidential resources are confidential to the extent permitted by statutory law and not considered \u201cresponsible employees\u201d pursuant to Section IIIC.\n\nConfidential Resources:\n\nCU Boulder\nUCCS\nCU Denver\nCU\u00a0Anschutz Medical Campus\nCU System Administration\n\nIf an individual discloses an incident to a responsible employee but wishes to maintain privacy or requests that no investigation be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the responsible employee remains required to report all relevant information to the Title IX Coordinator who will explain that the University prohibits retaliation and that the University will not only take steps to prevent retaliation but also to take strong responsive action if it occurs. If the individual would still like to maintain privacy or requests that no investigation be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the Title IX Coordinator will weigh that request against the University\u2019s obligation to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, faculty and staff. \u00a0In making that determination, the Title IX Coordinator will consider a range of factors, including the following:\n\nThe increased risk that the alleged perpetrator will commit additional acts of sexual or other violence;\nThe seriousness of the alleged conduct;\nWhether the alleged conduct was perpetrated with a weapon;\nWhether the alleged victim is a minor;\nWhether the University possesses other means to obtain relevant evidence of the alleged conduct (e.g., security cameras or personnel, physical evidence); and\n\nWhether the alleged conduct reveals a pattern of perpetration (e.g., via illicit use of drugs or alcohol) at a given location or by a particular group.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator\u2019s decision will be conducted on a case by case basis after an individualized review. \u00a0If the University honors the individual\u2019s request for privacy or requests that no investigation be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the University\u2019s ability to meaningfully investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary action, if appropriate, may be limited, but nonetheless may proceed.\nE. \u00a0Designation and Responsibilities of the Title IX Coordinator\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator is responsible for overseeing complaints of sexual misconduct pursuant to this policy and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during review of those complaints.\n\nEach campus shall designate and provide notice of the name, title, office address, telephone number and email address for the campus Title IX Coordinator and any designated Deputy Coordinators.\n\nTitle IX Coordinators:\n\u00a0\n\nCU Boulder\nUCCS\nCU Denver |\u00a0Anschutz Medical Campus\nCU System Administration\n\nFor all matters within the scope of this policy, at a minimum, each campus Title IX Coordinator or designee shall be specifically responsible and have delegated authority from the Chancellor for the following:\n\nEnsuring that complaints and any subsequent disciplinary actions are being handled appropriately and in a timely manner;\nOverseeing adequate, reliable and impartial investigations of complaints of sexual misconduct;\nEvaluating any complainantComplainantSee Section III. Definitions\u200b request for privacy pursuant to Section II(D);\nReferring matters for further action or discipline for inappropriate or unprofessional conduct under other applicable policies or procedures even if a sexual misconduct policy violation is not found.\u00a0 No provision of this policy shall be construed as a limitation on the authority of the disciplinary authority under applicable policies and procedures to initiate disciplinary action;\nFacilitating reasonable interim protective remedies and accommodations as applicable;\nEnsuring broad publication of the campus complaint process and \u00a0procedures, required pursuant to Section II(F) below, including posting the procedure on an appropriate campus website and maintaining a current procedure for each campus;\nProviding an annual report to the Chancellor documenting: (1) the number of reports or complaints of violations of this policy; (2) the categories (i.e., student, employeeEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. or other) of the parties involved; (3) the number of policy violations found; and (4) examples of sanctions imposed for policy violations;\nReviewing and confirming that the relevant policy statements of the campus Annual Security Report pursuant to the Clery Act are consistent with this policy and campus complaint process and procedures;\nOverseeing and monitoring campus compliance with this policy;\nEnsuring there is ongoing training and education regarding reporting and preventing sexual misconduct, for all students, faculty and staff;\nMaintaining records and related documentation of compliance with this policy, including, but not limited to retaining copies of any training documentation, tracking student and employee training participation, documenting each step of the campus complaint process and procedures from interim measures, accommodations for persons experiencing sexual misconduct, investigation, disciplinary proceeding, sanctions and any retaliation; and\nEnsuring broad dissemination of the statement that the University shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in employment or in its education programs and activities.\n\nF. \u00a0Investigation\/Adjudication Process and Procedures\n\nEach campus shall establish a written complaint process and procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of any sexual misconduct complaints within 60 days, except for good cause with written notice to the complainant and respondentRespondent:See Section III. Definitions\u200b of the delay and reason for the delay.\u00a0 Any applicable disciplinary procedure must provide a prompt, fair, transparent and impartial process from the investigation to the final results, including a procedure that:\u00a0\n\nIncludes timely notice of meetings;\nProvides timely and equal access to the complainant, respondent\u00a0and appropriate university officials to any relevant information, including witness identities and relevant information provided by witnesses;\nIs conducted by officials who do not have a conflict of interestConflict of interestSituations defined in the Administrative Policy Statement Conflict of Interest Policy in which financial or other personal considerations may compromise, or have the appearance of compromising, an employee's professional judgment in administration, management, instruction, research and other professional activities. This includes situations in which an employee might derive private gain due to her\/his association with the University. or bias for or against the complainant or respondent;\nAllows the complainant and respondent to each have an advisor, including an attorney, who is not a potential witness in the investigation or could otherwise compromise the investigation; and\nApplies the preponderance of the evidence standard in findings regarding the complaint.\n\nCampus Procedures:\n\nCU Boulder\nUCCS\nCU Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus\nCU System Administration\n\nG. \u00a0Complaints Involving Two or More Campuses\n\nWhen an alleged violation of this policy involves more than one University campus, the campus with primary disciplinary authority over the respondent shall investigate the complaint pursuant to its applicable complaint process and procedures. The campus responsible for the investigation may request the involvement or cooperation of any other affected campus and should advise appropriate officials of the affected campus of the progress and results of the investigation.\nH. \u00a0Campus Primary and Ongoing Prevention and Awareness Programs\n\nEach campus shall create, provide and publish a comprehensive, intentional and integrated programming, initiatives, strategies and campaigns intended to end sexual misconduct that are culturally relevant, inclusive of diverse communities and identities, sustainable, responsive to campus community needs and informed by research or assessed for value, effectiveness or outcome. These programs must also consider environmental risk and protective factors as they occur on the individual, relationship, institutional, community and societal levels.\n\nThe programs must include both primary prevention and awareness programs offered to incoming students and new employees and ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns directed at current students, faculty and staff.\n\nEach campus should develop its prevention programs taking into account the particular needs of its students, faculty and staff and shall include:\n\nA statement that the University prohibits sexual misconduct and provides notice of this policy, the campus complaint process and procedures and where complaints may be filed;\nThe definitions of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking in the applicable criminal jurisdiction;\nThe definition of consent, in reference to sexual activity, in the applicable criminal jurisdiction;\nSafe and positive options for bystander intervention that may be carried out by an individual to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of sexual misconduct against a person other than the individual;\nInformation on risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior and how to avoid potential attacks; and\nInformation about the procedures that alleged victims should follow, and that the campus will follow, after an incident of sexual misconduct has occurred.\n\nIII. Definitions\n\nItalicized terms used in this Administrative Policy Statement are defined in the Policy Glossary of Terms or are defined below.\n\nAffirmative consent:\u00a0 \u00a0Means the, unambiguous and voluntary agreement to engage in a specific sexual activity.\u00a0 Consent is clear, knowing and voluntary words or actions which create mutually understandable clear permission regarding willingness to engage in, and the conditions of, sexual activity. Consent must be active; silence by itself cannot be interpreted as consent.\n\n\tConsent is not effectively given if it results from the use of force, including threats, intimidation or coercion, or if it is from someone who is incapacitated:\n\t\nForce is the use of physical violence or imposing on someone physically to gain sexual access.\nThreats exist where a reasonable person would have been compelled by the words or actions of another to give permission to sexual contact they would not otherwise have given. For example, threats to kill someone, themselves or to harm someone one cares for constitute threats.\nIntimidation occurs when someone uses physical presence to menace another, although no physical contact occurs, or where knowledge of prior violent behavior by an assailant, coupled with menacing behavior, places someone in fear as an implied threat.\nCoercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity. Coercion differs from seduction by the repetition of the coercive activity beyond what is reasonable, the degree of pressure applied and other factors such as isolation. When someone makes it clear that they do not want sex, do not want to go past a certain point or want it to stop, continued pressure beyond that point can be coercive.\u00a0 It also includes \u201cgrooming\u201d meaning an attempt to control victims through a systematic process which takes advantage of an individual\u2019s vulnerabilities using a combination of strategies to gain the individual\u2019s trust, lower inhibitions and gain cooperation and \u201cconsent.\u201d\n\n\t\tConsent will be determined using both objective and subjective standards. The objective standard is met when a reasonable person would consider the words or actions of the parties to have manifested an agreement between them to do the same thing, in the same way, at the same time, with one another. The subjective standard is met when a party believes in good faith that the words or actions of the parties manifested an agreement between them to do the same thing, in the same way, at the same time, with one another.\n\t\t\u00a0\nA person who does not want to consent to sex is not required to resist.\nConsent to some forms of sexual activity does not automatically imply consent to other forms of sexual activity.\nSilence, previous sexual relationships or the existence of a current relationship do not imply consent.\nConsent cannot be implied by attire or inferred from the giving or acceptance of gifts, money or other items.\nConsent to sexual activity may be withdrawn at any time, as long as the withdrawal is communicated clearly.\nWithdrawal of consent can be done in numerous ways and need not be a verbal withdrawal of consent.\nA respondent\u2019s intoxication resulting from intentional use of alcohol\/drugs will not function as a defense to engaging in sexual activity without an individual\u2019s consent.\nIn order to give effective consent, the person giving consent must be of legal age under Colorado law for the purposes of determining whether there was a sexual assault.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nComplainant:\u00a0Within the context of this policy, means a person who is subject to alleged sexual misconduct or retaliation.\n\t\u00a0\nGender\/sex-based stalking:\u00a0Means directly or indirectly through another person, and based on actual or desired sexual or amorous relationships, repeatedly following, approaching, contacting, placing under surveillance or making any form of communication with another person, a member of that person\u2019s immediate family, or someone with whom that person has or has had a continuing relationship in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to (a) fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or; (b) suffer substantial emotional distress, including causing a person to respond by altering their activities.\n\t\u00a0\nIncapacitation:\u00a0 Incapacitation may result from alcohol or other drug use, unconsciousness or other factors. \u00a0The use of alcohol or drugs, in and of itself does not render a person incapacitated. Incapacitation is a state beyond drunkenness or intoxication. The impact of alcohol and drugs varies from person to person. \u00a0Incapacitation is a state where a person cannot make a rational, reasonable decision because they lack the capacity to give affirmative consent (to understand the who, what, when, where, why or how of sexual interaction.) Incapacity can also result from illness, sleep, mental disability and other circumstances.\u00a0 Engaging in sexual activity with a person whom you know to be mentally or physical incapacitated, or reasonably should know to be incapacitated, violates this policy.\n\t\u00a0\nIntimate partner abuse: Means any act of violence or threatened act of violence against a person with whom the individual is or has been involved in a sexual or dating relationship. This includes threats, assault, property damage and violence or threat of violence to one\u2019s self or to the family members of the sexual or romantic partner when used as a method of coercion, control, punishment, intimidation or revenge. This definition includes intimate partner violence, dating violence and domestic violence.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nRespondent: Within the context of this policy, means a person who is accused of alleged sexual misconduct or retaliation.\n\t\u00a0\nRetaliation: Means any adverse action threatened or taken against a person because an individual has filed, supported or provided information in connection with a complaint of sexual misconduct, including but not limited to direct and indirect intimidation, threats\u00a0and harassment.\u00a0 An \u201cadverse action\u201d is any conduct or action that would dissuade a reasonable person from reporting an allegation of sexual misconduct or participating in an investigation of sexual misconduct.\n\t\u00a0\nResponsible employee: Means any employee who: (1) has the authority to hire, promote, discipline, evaluate, grade, formally advise or direct faculty, staff or students; (2) has the authority to take action to redress sexual misconduct; and\/or (3) has been given the duty of reporting incidents of sexual violence or any other misconduct by students to the Title IX Coordinator. \u00a0\u00a0This definition does not include any medical, mental health, counseling or ombuds office personnel, in addition to any other offices covered by a statutory privilege or designated in campus procedures as not subject to mandatory reporting to the university.\n\t\u00a0\nSexual assault \u2013 nonconsensual sexual intercourse: \u00a0Means any sexual intercourse, however slight, with any object, by any person upon another person that is without affirmative consent and\/or by force. Intercourse includes vaginal penetration by a penis, object, tongue or finger; anal penetration by a penis, object, tongue or finger; and oral copulation (mouth to genital contact or genital to mouth contact), no matter how slight the penetration or contact.\u00a0 Also refer to the definitions of \u201caffirmative consent\u201d and \u201cincapacitation\u201d.\n\t\u00a0\nSexual assault \u2013 nonconsensual sexual contact: \u00a0Means any intentional sexual touching, however slight, with any object, by any person upon another person, that is without affirmative consent and\/or by force. Sexual contact includes intentional contact with the breasts, buttocks, groin or genitals, or touching another with any of these body parts, or making another touch you or themselves with or on any of these body parts; or any other intentional bodily contact in a sexual manner.\u00a0 Also refer to the definitions of \u201caffirmative consent\u201d and \u201cincapacitation\u201d.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nSexual exploitation: \u00a0Means conduct that takes sexual advantage of another person for the benefit of anyone other than that person without that person\u2019s consent. Examples of behavior that could rise to the level of sexual exploitation include: prostituting another person; recording images (e.g., video, photograph) or audio of another person\u2019s sexual activity, intimate body parts or nakedness without that person\u2019s consent; distributing images (e.g., video, photograph) or audio of another person\u2019s sexual activity, intimate body parts or nakedness, if the individual distributing the images or audio knows or should have known that the person depicted in the images or audio did not consent to such disclosure and objects to such disclosure; and, viewing another person\u2019s sexual activity, intimate body parts or nakedness in a place where that person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person\u2019s consent.\n\t\u00a0\nSexual harassment: \u00a0Means unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\n\n\tSexual harassment results if one of the following occurs:\n\nQuid Pro Quo (\u201cThis for That\u201d)\n\tThis type of sexual harassment occurs when the terms or conditions of employment,\u00a0 educational benefits, academic grades or opportunities, living environment or participation in a University activity is conditioned upon, either explicitly or implicitly, submission to or rejection of unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, or such submission or rejection is a factor in decisions affecting that individual\u2019s employment, education, living environment or participation in a University program or activity.\u200b\n\nHostile Environment\n\tHostile environment is a form of sexual harassment. Whether a hostile environment exists is determined from both a subjective and an objective perspective.\u00a0 The subjective perspective evaluates whether or not the complainant experienced unwelcome sexual conduct. \u00a0The objective perspective evaluates whether or not the unwelcome sexual conduct was, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the alleged complainant\u2019s position, sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with, limits or deprives an individual from participating in or benefiting from the University\u2019s education or employment programs and\/or activities.\u00a0 \u00a0Mere offensive nonsexual conduct is not enough to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d as defined in this policy.\u00a0 Although repeated incidents increase the likelihood that harassment has created a hostile environment, a single or isolated incident of sexual assault may be sufficient.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\nSexual misconduct: means the following unwelcome conduct based upon an individual\u2019s sex or gender - sexual assault-non-consensual sexual intercourse, sexual assault - non-consensual sexual contact, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, intimate partner abuse, gender\/sex-based stalking\u00a0and any related retaliation.\n\nIV.

Policy Statement\n\nThe university reserves the right to revoke a degree in cases of material academic misconductAcademic MisconductSee Section V. Definitions discovered after the degree was awarded. The university also reserves the right to revoke a degree to correct an administrative errorAdministrative ErrorSee Section V. Definitions, such as an incorrectly listed degree, or in a situation where it was found that a degree recipient had not actually fulfilled all graduation requirements.\n\nBecause the Board of Regents has the authority to award degrees, only the Board of Regents has the authority to revoke degrees. Such actions will be taken only after the campus forwarding the request has conducted a thorough investigation of circumstances leading to the recommendation and, if applicable, an appeals process has been completed.\nIII. Justification for Degree Revocation\n\nA degree may be revoked for any of the following reasons:\n\nAcademic Misconduct\n\n\tThe degree was awarded based, in whole or in part, upon the degree recipient\u2019s satisfying the academic requirements of the degree through actions which:\n\t\nconstitute academic dishonesty; or\n\t\t\u00a0\ninvolve falsification, misrepresentation, fabrication or other mischaracterization of the nature of or number of credit hours or degrees earned at the University of Colorado or at other institutions of higher education for which the university has given credit; or\n\t\t\u00a0\ninvolve falsification, misrepresentation, fabrication or other mischaracterization of the reasons for a waiver of academic requirements or the approval of a waiver of academic requirements; and\n\t\t\u00a0\nwould have resulted in a failure to meet graduation requirements if discovered prior to awarding the degree.\n\nAdministrative Error\n\n\tThe degree was awarded despite the degree recipient\u2019s failure to satisfy the applicable academic requirements, and the erroneous award of the degree was not due to the degree recipient\u2019s conduct.\n\nIV. Procedures\n\n\nAction Required for Degree Revocation\n\n\tA recommendation to revoke a degree shall be forwarded by the campus Chancellor to the university President with documentation to support the recommendation. The review by the President shall be limited to a determination of compliance with applicable campus process and procedures and adequacy of supporting materials.\n\t\nIf the President determines that campus policies and procedures have not been followed, or additional evidence or explanation is needed, he\/she may remand the matter to the campus for further action.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIf the President finds that the revocation of the degree is warranted, he\/she shall make a recommendation to the Board of Regents to revoke the degree. Notice shall be sent to the degree recipient and his\/her legal representative. The degree recipient or his\/her legal representative shall also be notified of the date of the Board meeting at which the matter will be considered as well as any evidentiary or procedural protocols.\n\nTime Limits\n\n\tIf the failure to satisfy degree requirements was due to any of the reasons identified in section III.A of this policy, the right to revoke a degree may be exercised at any time upon discovery.\n\n\tIf administrative error resulted in the awarding of a degree despite the failure to satisfy degree requirements, as identified in section III.B of this policy, the right to revoke a degree may only be exercised within two years of granting the degree.\n\t\u00a0\nStudent Records\n\n\tThe date of degree revocation will appear on the official transcript and the individual will be asked to return the diploma.\n\n\tIf a degree is revoked due to administrative error and a corrected degree is\u00a0awarded, the corrected degree will be mailed to the degree recipient and the transcript will be corrected.\n\n\tWhen possible, a corrected transcript will be forwarded to all individuals and entities who were sent an official transcript after the degree was initially posted to the transcript.\n\nV. Definitions\n\n\nAcademic Misconduct is any action, intentional or not, that gives a student unearned or unfair advantage in academic work over other students.

Using the campus policy that outlines the grounds for closure, the committee shall collect information to ascertain whether there are such grounds (Appendix A provides some suggestions that campuses may consider when developing their own policy on grounds for program discontinuance). The committee shall take input from the faculty members of the unit recommended for closure and from other faculty members, students, and administrative units affected by the possible closure.\u00a0 If closure is recommended, the committee shall make recommendations for faculty appointments to be terminated.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nBased upon the committee's report, the chancellor shall prepare a written summary of findings and conclusions of the review, citing the relevant criteria in the policy. If the chancellor determines that closure is not warranted, consideration of the program discontinuance will end, unless the recommendation for closure came from the president or the Board of Regents. In that case, the written summary and recommendation shall be forwarded to the president, who shall follow the procedure outlined below in Section II.B.\n\t\t\u00a0\nIf the chancellor believes closure may be warranted, he\/she shall consult with faculty members and administrators in the affected unit, and such consultation shall address reassignment, retraining or retirement of the affected faculty. Before completing his\/her report, the chancellor or provost shall offer to meet with any tenured faculty member whose appointment may be recommended for termination. If the chancellor determines that closure is warranted, he\/she shall inform the affected unit and its college\/school of the recommendation for closure and prepare a plan for program closure.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe plan for program closure shall include: (1) the rationale and timing for phasing out the program; (2) a statement of how students enrolled in the program may complete the degree in a reasonable time; (3) identification of and rationale for all faculty appointments that may be terminated; (4) analysis of other faculty and staff appointments affected by discontinuance; and (5) any other issues related to closure of the program.\n\t\t\u00a0\nUnless there are compelling academic reasons, no tenured faculty member shall be terminated until all faculty members without tenure in the affected program(s) have been terminated.\u00a0 In the event of a proposed program discontinuance, the school or college shall attempt to place each tenured faculty member being considered for termination in other organizational units if the faculty member can be shown to be capable of fulfilling the necessary educational responsibilities of that unit and the unit is willing to accept the faculty member (See II.C.1. below).\u00a0 These placement efforts shall be documented.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFor the purposes of this policy, non-renewal of a tenure-track faculty appointment through the normal reappointment process shall not be considered to be a termination. \u00a0As used in this policy, the \"termination of a tenure-track faculty appointment\" means ending the appointment prior to the end of the current contract.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe chancellor shall present the final recommendation for closure and the plan to the president within 120 calendar days of the start of the process (marked by the date of the initial formal written request for consideration of program discontinuance). The recommendation document shall include: (i) the chancellor's recommendation and plan, and (ii) all materials provided to the chancellor by the review committee.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nReview by President and Board of Regents\n\nPresidential Review of Program Discontinuance Recommendations Initiated at the Campus Level\n\n\t\tIf the chancellor recommends program discontinuance, where the program discontinuance review began at the campus level, the president shall review the chancellor\u2019s recommendation and documentation. During the course of the president's review, the president shall afford each\u00a0 tenured faculty member whose appointment is recommended for termination, the opportunity to present written evidence\/arguments in support of the continuance of the faculty member's appointment. Any such comments comments shall be included with the president's recommendation to the Board. The president shall have 60 calendar days to deliver a final recommendation to the Board.\u00a0 The President shall include with his or her final recommendation to the Board all documentation that the Chancellor sent to the President.\n\t\t\u00a0\nPresidential Review of Program Discontinuance Reviews Initiated by the President\n\n\t\tIf the program discontinuance review was initiated by the president, the chancellor shall send his or her report to the president regardless of the chancellor\u2019s recommendation.\u00a0 If, under these circumstances, the chancellor does not recommend program discontinuance and the president disagrees, then the president shall submit, in writing, her\/his rationale for moving forward with program discontinuance.\u00a0 If the Board of Regents agrees with the president, then the president, in consultation with the chancellor and any campus administrators and faculty the president deems appropriate, shall prepare a plan for program closure.\u00a0 This plan will include the identification of tenured or tenure-track faculty appointments recommended for termination and will be presented to the Board of Regents for review and action, if any.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\nFinal Decision by the Board of Regent\n\n\t\tThe Board of Regents shall make the final decision on program discontinuance and the termination of tenured and tenure-track faculty appointments. Because the Board of Regents grants tenure, only the Board can take action to terminate an individual faculty member's tenure.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nInformation for Faculty Members Affected by Discontinuance\n\nYear of Notice\n\n\t\tFollowing the Board of Regents' decision to terminate an academic program and its tenured faculty, the chancellor shall provide formal written notice of termination consistent with University policy. \u00a0\u00a0Faculty members shall be notified of the effective date of termination and whether they are entitled to severance pay.\n\n\t\tAfter formal approval by the Board of Regents, tenured and tenure-track faculty members whose appointments are to be terminated shall have one year's notice (\"notice year\") prior to the effective date of termination. For tenured and tenure-track faculty members with 9-month contracts, the\u00a0 notice year shall commence at the beginning of the next academic year. For tenured and tenure-track faculty members with 12-month contracts, it shall commence at the beginning of the next fiscal year.\n\n\t\tDuring the notice year, reasonable efforts shall be made by the chancellor or chancellor's designee to find another suitable position for the faculty member within the University, subject to the requirement that intercampus or interdepartmental transfers can be made only if they are mutually acceptable to the faculty member, the receiving academic unit (by a vote of its faculty), and the chancellor(s). During the notice year the chancellor or the chancellor\u2019s designee may provide faculty with retraining if such retraining shall not interfere with the faculty member\u2019s assigned teaching and other professional obligations during the notice year. \u00a0\u00a0Eligible faculty members shall have the option to retire in accordance with University policies.\n\n\t\tFollowing the notice year, if reasonable efforts to reassign, retrain, or retire have failed, the faculty member may be terminated with applicable severance pay in accordance with the Regent's policy on program discontinuance.\n\t\t\u00a0\nSeverance Pay\n\n\t\tSeverance pay is available only to a tenured member of the faculty whose appointment has been involuntarily terminated due to program discontinuance. A faculty member who elects to resign or retire from the University may not receive severance pay pursuant to this APS.\u00a0 In order to be eligible for severance pay, a tenured faculty member shall fulfill assigned teaching and other professional obligations throughout the notice year.\u00a0 Severance pay in the amount of base salary for one academic year for tenured faculty members with 9-month contracts, and for one fiscal year for tenured faculty members with 12-month contracts shall be provided by the campus whose faculty appointments are terminated under this policy.\u00a0 At the discretion of the campus, severance pay shall be provided in full within 60 calendar days after the effective date of termination or paid in equal monthly amounts over a specified period (up to a maximum of one year) commencing 30 calendar days after the effective date of termination of employment. Severance payments made over multiple fiscal years are subject to annual appropriations as required by law.\u200b\n\t\t\u00a0\nReinstatement Rights of Tenured Faculty\n\n\t\tIf a program is reinstated within three years at the campus where it was discontinued, a tenured faculty member who was terminated as a result of the program's closure shall have a right to reinstatement, provided a position is available that is substantially similar in responsibilities to the one previously held by the faculty member. For the purpose of notification of reinstatement, terminated faculty members shall keep the university informed of their current address during the three-year period.\n\t\t\u00a0\nUntenured Tenure-Track Faculty Appointments\n\n\t\tAfter the Board of Regents formally approves the termination of a program and the program\u2019s discontinuance plan, untenured tenure-track faculty members identified in the plan for termination shall continue their employment with the University during the notice year prior to the effective date of termination, as provided under subsection II.C.1 above.\n\t\t\u00a0\nNon-Tenure-Track Faculty Appointments\n\n\t\tAfter the Board of Regents formally approves termination of a program and the program\u2019s discontinuance plan, the University may terminate the employment of a non-tenure track faculty member, including a faculty member who has entered a contract pursuant to the APS on multi-year contracts for non-tenure-track faculty members.\n\t\t\u00a0\nFaculty Rights Under COBRA\n\n\t\tA faculty member who is terminated for reasons of program discontinuance shall be eligible to participate in the University group insurance program for 18 months following the date of termination under the conditions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) if the faculty member is enrolled in the University's group insurance program at the time of termination.\n\t\t\u00a0\nEmployment Counseling\n\n\t\tThe campus shall provide counseling regarding employment opportunities outside of the University upon request by a faculty member whose position is being eliminated.\n\t\t\u00a0\nRight to File Grievance\n\n\t\tAn eligible tenured faculty member whose appointment is terminated for reasons of program discontinuance may file a grievance with the Faculty Senate Privilege and Tenure Committee under its policies and procedures. The filing of a grievance does not affect the timing of the discontinuance process outlined in this policy.\u00a0 The Privilege and Tenure Committee shall not rehear the basic decision to discontinue the unit.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nStudents\n\nConsistent with university policy, reasonable efforts shall be made to allow students to complete their degree program. Program or campus transfers shall be permitted if mutually acceptable to the student and the receiving department. Students shall be provided advising assistance with respect to their academic program options. Students will be notified of program closure and timing for phasing out programs.\n\nSee Appendix: Program Closure Considerations\nIII. \u00a0History\n\n\n\n\nInitial Policy Effective: January 1, 1987\nPolicy Revisions: February 2, 2004, June 1, 2005, July 1, 2009, July 1, 2013, April 9, 2015, January 1, 2018 \u2013 Minor cleanup related to changes to Regent\u00a0 Article 4 and Policy 4.\u200b\n\n\nAppendix - Program Closure Considerations\n\nThe following are non-exclusive lists of factors that may be considered during review of a program being considered for discontinuance.\n\nEducational reasons:\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nThe long-term state, regional and national needs for such academic or research efforts;\u00a0\nThe existence of similar academic or research efforts at other academic or research institutions;\u00a0\nThe quality of the campus' program in terms of the (a) faculty and staff, (b) students, (c) accreditation or\u00a0program review, or (d) research and other facilities (library collections, laboratories, field support facilities,\u00a0etc.);\u00a0\nThe importance of the program as a support for, or as an integral part of, other campus or University\u00a0academic and research programs;\nThe importance of the program as fundamental to a university education;\nThe importance of the program to the state or region in terms of its cultural, historic, political, economic, or other social aspects;\nThe importance of the program to the state or region; or\nOther relevant factors that indicate that the program cannot be maintained for academic reasons.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nBudgetary constraints, resource allocation or other financial reasons:\u200b\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nActual or projected revenues and costs of the program including both direct and indirect costs;\nPotential cost savings from elimination of the program;\nEfficiency of program operations in relation to revenues and expenditures (and credit hours and research\u00a0dollars);\nThe program's contribution to the campus' fiscal health;\nPerformance data related to the program such as the cyclical nature of the discipline's relevance, multi-year\u00a0trends and projections for enrollment, retention, completion, placements, impacts on other programs and\u00a0capacity data such as student\/faculty ratios, courses taught by tenure versus non-tenure track, research\u00a0productivity, programmatic cost benefit analysis, ability to generate income; or\nOther relevant factors that indicate that the program cannot be maintained due to budgetary constraints,\u00a0resource allocations, or other financial reasons.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nStrategic realignment reasons:\u200b\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nImportance of the program to the campus mission;\nRole of the program in the campus or college strategic plan (academic master plan);\nAbility of the program to enhance the campus' reputation in the state and nation;\nExcellence of the program or its promise for future excellence in teaching, research, or both;\nCost of investing in the program to achieve and maintain excellence;\nUniqueness of the program to the state, CU System, and the relevant geographic area;\nMarketplace demand for the program;\nProgram's role in supporting other key programs at the campus; or\nOther relevant factors that indicate that the program cannot be maintained for strategic realignment reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"\u201cProgram discontinuance\u201d is the formal termination of a program by the Board of Regents for educational, strategic realignment, resource reallocation, budget constraint, or combinations of educational, strategic, and\/or financial reasons.\u00a0 In all cases, as described in Section II.B, the Board of Regents shall make the final decision with respect to program discontinuance and the termination of tenure-track or tenured faculty appointments.\u00a0 For purposes of this APS, \"program\" refers to a degree program, department or division, school or college, or other program unit.

Policy Statement\n\n\nExtended Paid Administrative Leave\n\n\tIf a university staffUniversity staffAn individual who holds a staff position that is exempt from the state personnel system's rules and regulations (pursuant to state law). University staff is governed by the Board of Regent laws and policies. or faculty member on a twelve-month appointment is the subject of disciplinary action or an investigation, extended paid administrative leave may be authorized for such employee for a reasonable period of time. In such circumstances, a reasonable period of time will be determined based upon the length of time it takes to complete an investigation. Only the president or chancellors, or their designees, may authorize extended paid administrative leave for university staff and twelve-month faculty for investigative purposes.\n\n\tHowever, the president or chancellors, or their designees, reserve the right to place university staff or faculty on twelve-month appointment on extended leave without pay.\nShort-Term Paid Administrative Leave\n\n\tSupervisors of eligible employees may authorize short-term paid administrative leave for the purposes described in this policy. A maximum of ten (10) days or eighty (80) hours of short-term administrative leave may be granted over a twelve-month period.\n\n\tShort-term paid administrative leave is not an entitlement or benefit. Authorization of short-term paid administrative leave for eligible employees rests within the sole discretion of their supervisors as exercised within the guidelines described in this policy.\n\t\nPurpose of Short-Term Paid Administrative Leave.\n\n\t\tSupervisors may authorize short-term paid administrative leave for eligible employees for reasons determined to be for the good of the university and the state. Supervisors shall consider prudent use of taxpayer dollars and the business needs of the university in determining whether such leave is for the good of the state. Such reasons include, but are not limited to, incentive rewards, coursework directly related to employment, and participation in school or community volunteer activities.\n\n\t\tShort-term paid administrative leave may also be authorized for eligible employees whose workloads (e.g., specific long or short term projects) require them to work significantly beyond their normal work schedules (as established by their individual supervisors) for prolonged periods of time when such leave is found to be necessary to maintain employee performance or morale or in recognition of extraordinary work performance.\n\n\t\tUse of short-term paid administrative leave is not required for eligible employees for the purpose of attending or participating in professional or academic seminars or conferences, participation in official activities of university employee organizations or other similar events, or supervisor required training. These activities are considered to be work time for which leave is not required.\nAuthorization of Short-Term Paid Administrative Leave\n\n\t\tOrdinarily, eligible employees must have their supervisor's authorization prior to taking short-term paid administrative leave. In exceptional circumstances, short-term paid administrative leave may be authorized retroactively.\n\nReporting Requirements\n\nAll use of paid administrative leave for eligible employees, except in situations of campus closures, must be reported by use of the university's time collection procedures. The president shall review the use of short-term paid administrative leave on an annual basis.\n\nIII.

Policy Statement\nAll Degree programs shall be reviewed at least once every seven years. Each campus shall have policies defining program review procedures. These procedures shall be designed to identify strengths and weaknesses of each degree program and provide constructive options for program improvement.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this policy is to promote and maintain high-quality degree programs that are administered efficiently.\n\nA program review schedule may be modified to coincide with a professional accreditation review.\nIII. Annual Program Review Report\n\n\nOn an annual basis, all campuses shall submit to the Vice President for Academic Affairs:\n\t\nA schedule of degree program reviews to occur in the next seven-year period.\n\t\t\u00a0\nA list of degree program reviews completed in the prior academic year.\n\t\t\u00a0\nA summary report of each degree program review completed in the prior academic year.

History\n\nThe Board of Regents passed a resolution at its November 1980 meeting requiring the review of all academic programs once every five years where feasible, but at least once every seven years. The resolution also identified the goals for those reviews. The program review requirement was codified in Regent Policy 4.C. In July 2017, Regent Policy 4.C was revised, limiting the program review requirement to degree programs. The new requirement is captured in current Regent Policy 4.B.\n\nImplementation of Regent Policy on Program Review approved March 16, 1989.\n\nRevised:\n\nMarch 1, 1996.\nSeptember 1, 1996.\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nJuly 1, 2010.\nJanuary 1, 2014.\nJanuary 1, 2018.\nApril 2, 2018 \u2013 non-substantial clarification to Section III.A.3.ii.b.\n\nV.

BensonResponsible University Officer:\u00a0Vice President for Academic AffairsResponsible Office:\u00a0Office of the Vice President for Academic AffairsPolicy Contact:\u00a0Office of the Vice President for Academic AffairsSupersedes:\u00a0January 1, 2011 (Revised May 1, 2011)Last Reviewed\/Updated date:\u00a0October 19, 2016Applies to:\u00a0University-wide\n\n\n\nII. \u00a0Policy Statement\n\nEvery primary unit (described below) and reviewing body or person making recommendations concerning comprehensive review, tenure and promotion shall strictly follow and apply the procedures and standards described herein. Failure to adhere to these procedures and standards may lead to the imposition of sanctions. Questions about proper processes and procedures should be directed to the dean, faculty affairs office, or provost.\nIII. \u00a0Standards of Performance for Tenure\n\nTenure may be awarded only to faculty members with demonstrated meritorious performance in each of the three areas of teaching, research or creative work, and leadership and service to the University and the faculty member\u2019s profession, and demonstrated excellence in either teaching or research\/creative work. Candidates at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) may also be evaluated on professional practice, in which case they must also demonstrate meritorious performance in that area. \u00a0Faculty members in health science fields may be required by their respective schools or colleges to demonstrate meritorious performance in clinical activity\/clinical care, public health practice, or other professional areas as appropriate. Librarians must demonstrate meritorious performance in librarianship and curators in curatorial activities. In addition, faculty members in the School of Medicine, School of Pharmacy and the Colorado School of Public Health must meet the standards of the School that were approved by the Board of Regents. In the School of Medicine, tenure may be awarded only to faculty members with national and international reputations for academic excellence who are among the best in their field of academic endeavor and who have demonstrated excellence in scholarship, as well as excellence in, and dedication to teaching (as further defined in the rules of the School of Medicine). \u00a0Public Health may consider in its tenure recommendations public health practice\/clinical activity and scholarly activity, as further defined by its bylaws. In the School of Pharmacy, tenure may be awarded only to faculty members who have demonstrated excellence in scholarship and demonstrated excellence in, and dedication to, teaching. Professional\/administrative leadership and service and\/or clinical activities should be weighed into any decision regarding tenure, but such activities in the absence of significant accomplishments in both teaching and scholarship are not an adequate basis for tenure.\nIV. \u00a0The Tenure and Promotion Review\n\nThe primary unit is composed of professional colleagues most directly involved with the candidate and having authority to make recommendations concerning comprehensive review, tenure, and promotion. In schools and colleges with departmental organizations, each department will usually constitute a primary unit. In a school or college without such organization all tenured and tenure-track faculty members have the responsibility for developing the terms of the working structure whereby the primary unit is defined. The primary unit may be a division, or may be the school or college as a whole. In some instances the primary unit may involve faculty from cognate departments or institutes.\nThe tenure and promotion decisions are based on summary evaluations of a faculty member\u2019s cumulative performance. These processes are separate and distinct from the annual merit performance evaluation that begins at the level of the primary unit. In making comprehensive review, tenure, and\/or promotion recommendations, all primary units shall evaluate the candidate's performance in the required areas, and shall also take into account other factors that have a material bearing on a comprehensive review, tenure, or promotion recommendation in that unit.1\u00a0 The program requirements of the unit shall be considered at the time of the comprehensive review, but they may not be considered in recommendations for the award of tenure.\nEvery candidate for comprehensive review, tenure, and promotion shall consult with and be advised by the chair of the primary unit (or her or his designee) regarding the areas of performance that will be examined, other factors that have a material bearing on the decision, the standards of performance that must be met, and the primary unit criteria that the unit uses in reaching a decision about the candidate's performance.\nJoint or Split Appointments: When joint or split appointments are made, the affected faculty member must be informed in writing, prior to the appointment, of:\n\n\n\nThe duties and expectations as agreed upon by all primary units involved.\nWhich primary unit will be responsible for such personnel recommendations as tenure, reappointment, promotion, and salary.\n\n\nV. \u00a0The Dossier\n\nEach candidate for comprehensive review, tenure or promotion, assisted by the head of the primary unit making the recommendation, shall prepare a comprehensive dossier for evaluation. Faculty members should include copies of their published materials, as well as supporting data and electronic communications documenting their professional activities. The School of Medicine has different standards for the dossier and campuses may have requirements in addition to the ones listed below. The primary unit or the dean should provide templates or models of good dossiers to guide candidates in dossier preparation. The dossier submitted by the candidate shall include the following materials:\n\n\n\nA current curriculum vitae.\nEvidence concerning the teaching ability of the candidate, including results of learner evaluations. (See the \u00a0\u00a0administrative policy statement \u201cMultiple Means of Teaching Evaluation\u201d for examples of the types of evaluative material that can be used). Each candidate should submit an organized teacher\u2019s portfolio that highlights her\/his accomplishments in teaching (for example, development of new instructional materials or methods, educational scholarship, receipt of teaching awards or other evidence of success as a teacher, course syllabi, and Faculty Course Questionnaires, which are required). This section may also include evaluations by the candidate's students, colleagues or other qualified individuals who may have observed the candidate's teaching in classroom, laboratory, clinical or other settings. A self-evaluative statement or narrative summary should be provided.\nDocuments supporting the candidate\u2019s research, scholarly or creative work, clinical activity and professional practice. This section may include articles, book reviews, research data and grants, receipt of awards, electronic communications, unsolicited letters and other evidence of success. A self-evaluative statement or narrative summary should be provided.\nDocuments supporting the candidate\u2019s leadership and service\u00a0to the university, profession and community. A self-evaluative statement or narrative summary should be provided.\nAny other information the candidate believes will assure adequate consideration and evaluation during her\/his comprehensive review, tenure review, or promotion review.\n\n\nDocuments to be added by the primary unit following receipt of the dossier from the candidate include:\n\n\n\nA copy of the primary unit criteria;\nPrevious reappointment, tenure and\/or promotion (RTP) letters if required by the campus, primary unit, school\/college or library; and\/or\nEvaluation letters received from External Reviewers.\n\n\nVI. \u00a0Evaluations from External Reviewers\n\nThe primary unit requests evaluations in writing by scholars from outside the University and from various locations who are qualified to judge the candidate, using a solicitation letter following the college-approved format. Such outside evaluations are mandatory in cases of recommendations for tenure and promotion. Comprehensive reviews may also include external evaluations, as determined by the campus\/college\/school\/library policy. Selection of external evaluators shall be undertaken by the primary unit; the candidate shall be given the opportunity to suggest possible evaluators and\/or indicate specific scholars whom the candidate feels should be excluded from consideration. Primary unit bylaws will describe the process used in the primary unit for the selection of external evaluators. Care must be taken to exclude any evaluators whose evaluations may constitute a conflict of interest, such as a dissertation director. A minimum of three external letters shall be added to the file; however, campuses, schools\/colleges\/libraries may require a greater number of letters. All letters that are received must be included in the candidate\u2019s promotion or tenure dossier. These letters must be treated as confidential; they shall not be shared with the candidate. The primary unit may offer external evaluators a modest stipend for their work. Primary unit letters should include summaries of key comments by evaluators, with all identifiers removed to preserve confidentiality.\nVII. Evaluation Criteria\n\nPrimary Unit Criteria and Procedures: Each primary unit shall develop specific written criteria and procedures for measuring the performance of candidates in the primary unit that are consistent with the standards herein. These approved criteria, called the \"primary unit criteria,\" shall be subject to periodic review and approval by the dean and provost. All primary unit criteria shall be in writing and shall be included in the candidate\u2019s dossier or made available electronically to individuals and committees involved in higher levels of review. They must be used by the primary unit and by all other bodies or persons as part of their evaluation of the candidate. Regent Law 5-B, Regent Policy 5-M, this administrative policy statement, and the primary unit criteria and procedures shall be made available by the head of the primary unit to each faculty member at the time of initial hiring\/appointment. The primary unit criteria shall include a description of the level of achievement that warrants the designations \u201cmeritorious\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d performance in teaching, research or creative work, and leadership and service\u00a0as well as in other applicable evaluation areas. It will also provide a description of the types of evidence that will be used to evaluate the candidate against the performance standards. Examples of criteria to be considered in evaluating teaching, research or creative work, and leadership and service are included in Appendix A.\n\nEarly Tenure \u2013 The standards of performance that apply to faculty members on the seven-year tenure clock apply to faculty members who come up for early tenure. They must have a record of achievement in teaching, research or creative work, levels of review clinical activity, and leadership and service\u00a0that is equal to the record expected of a faculty member coming up in the seventh year. Additional criteria or higher standards cannot be applied to candidates for early tenure. Department chairs and mentors have a responsibility to counsel tenure-track faculty on the wisdom of coming up for early promotion or tenure. An unsuccessful candidate for early tenure may reapply within the existing tenure clock.\nVIII. Levels of Review\n\nAt each level, the committees will vote on the teaching, research\/creative work, and leadership and service\u00a0(and, where indicated in primary unit criteria, the clinical activity, public health practice or professional practice) of the candidate as \u201cnot meritorious,\u201d \u201cmeritorious,\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d The committee will then vote on whether to recommend promotion or tenure, and will forward the result of all votes, together with the dossier, to the next level.2 \u00a0Committee members at every level shall maintain the confidentiality of the deliberations.\nThe First-Level Review is at the college, library, or school level; it includes review by the primary unit and the chair, the dean\u2019s review committee and the dean.\nThe Primary Unit Evaluation Committee is the group within the primary unit responsible for initially reviewing the qualifications of candidates for comprehensive review, tenure, and\/or promotion. In a small primary unit, all members of the unit may constitute such a committee. Only members of the primary unit holding tenure may vote on decisions relating to tenure. No individual may participate in more than one stage of the review process. Participation includes being present for any discussion of the review or providing information or opinions to any individuals who will be discussing the candidate\u2019s application.\nThe Primary Unit Evaluation Committee\u2019s recommendation includes:\n\n\n\nA description and evaluation of the candidate's scholarly and creative work, research, teaching, clinical activity, professional practice, public health practice, and leadership and service\u00a0to the University or the community, as required by primary unit criteria;\nA statement describing the procedures followed and actions taken by the unit making the recommendation, including the reasons for the recommendation and any dissenting statements from the recommendation (this statement must include the results of any vote taken);\nSalient points of the external reviewers\u2019 analyses, with care taken to maintain confidentiality;\nIf required by the individual school, college or library, the findings of the comprehensive review.\n\n\nThe Dean\u2019s Advisory or Review Committee aids in the evaluation of recommendations forwarded by the Primary Unit Evaluation Committee. Where it is not possible for the review committee to consist of faculty members other than those in the primary unit, the dean will form a review committee that will include faculty from other schools or colleges. The dean shall determine whether the committee will be elected or appointed.\nShould either the Review Committee or the dean disagree with the recommendation of the primary unit, the dean shall communicate the nature of this disagreement with the head of the primary unit. The primary unit shall then reconsider its original recommendation and return its reconsidered judgment to the dean for her\/his consideration and that of the review committee. The recommendation of the dean, the results of the votes of the primary unit and the review committee, and the comprehensive dossier on the candidate shall be forwarded together to the provost. Where differences of opinion between the primary unit, the review committee, and\/or the dean have occurred and have not been resolved, each party in the disagreement shall submit a brief statement outlining the areas of disagreement and the reasons for its recommendation in that context.\nThe Second-Level Review is at the campus level; it includes review by the vice chancellor for academic affairs\u2019 advisory committee, the vice chancellor for academic affairs, hereafter referred to as the \u201cprovost,\u201d and the chancellor. However, at the Anschutz Medical Campus, promotions without dissenting votes from the first-level review are not subject to a second-level review except for the approval of the provost\/vice chancellor for academic affairs and chancellor.\n\n\n\nThe provost on each campus shall have an advisory committee of faculty members to assist her\/him in the review of recommendations submitted by the dean. The provost shall determine whether the committee will be elected or appointed, and the committee will participate fully with the provost in the review of the recommendation from the first level. If the provost disagrees with the recommendation from the first-level review, he\/she shall transmit to the dean of the school or college the nature of the disagreement. The dean and the review committee shall then reconsider their recommendation and return their reconsidered judgment(s) to the provost. At her\/his discretion, the dean may seek additional input from the primary unit as part of this reconsideration. The provost shall make her\/his final recommendation regarding tenure to the chancellor, who, if he\/she agrees, forwards positive recommendations to the president of the University after the completion of this process. When the chancellor\u2019s determination concerning reappointment or the award of tenure is negative, that decision is final unless the faculty member seeks a third-level review.\nIf the provost finds significant procedural errors that may have affected the outcome of the case, he\/she may return the case to the primary unit and other levels of the campus review to repeat the process. The provost may, at her\/his discretion, appoint a responsible party to oversee the process to ensure procedural integrity and fairness to the candidate. If it is determined that the repetition of the process will carry forward into the next academic year, the provost may extend the contract of the candidate by one year. The re-evaluation process shall focus on the record as it existed at the time of the first review.\nA candidate for comprehensive review, promotion and\/or tenure shall be informed of the final determination of the chancellor in writing as expeditiously as possible. All positive recommendations for tenure shall be forwarded to the president. Decisions not to recommend tenure are not forwarded from the campus.\n\n\nThe Third-Level Review is at the presidential level; it refers either (1) to the review by the president of a positive recommendation for tenure or (2) to an appeal of a negative decision for comprehensive review or tenure by a candidate. Promotion decisions are completed at the second level of review and are not eligible for third-level review. If flawed by procedural errors, promotion decisions may be appealed to the Faculty Senate Committee on Promotion and Tenure.\n\n\n\nAll positive recommendations for tenure shall be forwarded to the president for review and approval prior to submission to the Board of Regents. The role of the President\u2019s Office in faculty personnel decisions is to ensure that appropriate and established procedures are followed, and that University standards for tenure and promotion are upheld at each campus. The primary responsibility for making personnel decisions rests with the Chancellors.\nIn the case of a negative decision on tenure by the chancellor, the faculty member, within ten working days of receipt of written notice of denial for tenure from the chancellor, may request review by the president. The president may review, at the initiation of a faculty member, a negative decision of the campus chancellor regarding tenure. This request for review shall be made only on the grounds that the review contained either (1) procedural errors of sufficient magnitude that they may have affected the outcome, (2) substantive errors (such as a biased summary of student comments) of sufficient magnitude that they may have affected the outcome, or (3) prima facie evidence of discrimination, or some combination of these grounds. The president reviews the request and determines whether there are grounds for a third-level review. If there are grounds, the president shall convene a system-wide advisory committee of tenured faculty members chosen in consultation with faculty council to review the case. The advisory committee shall be provided with a complete dossier on each candidate referred to it by the president. After completing its review, the advisory committee will make its recommendation to the president.\nAfter considering the advisory committee\u2019s recommendation, and if he\/she disagrees with a recommendation for tenure submitted by the chancellor, the president shall transmit to him or her the nature of the disagreement. The chancellor shall then reconsider her\/his recommendation and return her\/his reconsidered judgment to the president. The president shall make her\/his final determination whether to deny tenure or to recommend tenure to the Board of Regents only upon completion of this process.\n\n\nThe Board of Regents makes the final decision on the award of tenure (including for outside hires with tenure). Only the Board has the power either to award tenure or to rescind a tenured appointment.\nIX. Comprehensive Review\n\nEach tenure-track faculty member below the rank of associate professor and faculty members in the Law School hired at the rank of associate professor shall be evaluated in a comprehensive manner, as outlined in the primary unit documents, at least once during the tenure probationary period (at the School of Medicine, School of Pharmacy and the Colorado School of Public Health, at least once during the promotion probationary period), apart from the review for promotion or the award of tenure. (Regent Laws Article 5.B.6.B.1) \u00a0The comprehensive review is a critical appraisal designed to identify a candidate\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in sufficient time to allow promising candidates to improve their records before the evaluation for tenure. The review may include evaluation by external reviewers, as determined by the campus\/school\/college\/library policy. Candidates for reappointment may receive specific advice about aspects of their performance that need improvement, although non-reappointment is also a possible result of the comprehensive review. If a candidate is not reappointed, he or she may request a third-level review, as described above. If not reappointed because of the outcome of the comprehensive review, he\/she will have a terminal year before her\/his appointment ends\nX. Promotion\n\nAll candidates for promotion to associate professor and professor must meet the University\u2019s standards of performance as approved by the Board of Regents:\n\n\n\nAssociate professors should have the terminal degree appropriate to their field or its equivalent, considerable successful teaching experience, and increasing accomplishment in research, scholarship\/creative activity or clinical service\/professional practice, as articulated in the primary unit criteria.\nProfessors should have the terminal degree appropriate to their field or its equivalent, and (A) a record that, taken as a whole, is judged to be excellent; (B) a record of significant contribution to both graduate and undergraduate education, unless individual or departmental circumstances can be shown to require a stronger emphasis, or singular focus, on one or the other; and (C) a record, since receiving tenure or promotion to associate professor, that indicates substantial, significant, and continued growth, development, and accomplishment in teaching, research, scholarship or creative work, leadership and service, and other applicable areas.\u00a0\n\n\nXI. Post-Tenure Review\n\nThe purposes of post-tenure review (PTR) are: (1) to facilitate continued faculty development, consistent with the academic needs and goals of the University and the most effective use of institutional resources; and (2) to ensure professional accountability by a regular, comprehensive evaluation of every tenured faculty member's performance. \u00a0Each campus has developed procedures for appropriate peer evaluation during PTR and for appeals of the PTR evaluation. College or department level PTR procedures must conform to the campus procedures and this administrative policy statement. The PTR evaluation shall be conducted by appropriate faculty peers within the campus, either the primary unit faculty or the faculty of the appropriate college personnel review committee. This committee shall be called the post-tenure review committee. Other units may be consulted as appropriate.\nThe post-tenure review process begins at tenure with the first PTR occurring five years after the faculty member is continuously tenured and recurs at five year intervals unless interrupted by promotion review. Promotion serves to re-start the PTR clock. Faculty undergoing PTR shall not, in that year, serve on the PTR evaluation committee.\nThe primary unit's written standards for reappointment, tenure, and promotion describe the nature and measures of achievement in teaching, research\/creative work, clinical activity, and leadership and service within the discipline that shall be employed in PTR evaluations. \u00a0The written standards of primary units shall include guidelines\/descriptions of \"meeting expectations,\" the standard of acceptable professional performance.\u00a0 In a Regular Five-Year Review, the Post-Tenure Review committee examines the five previous annual performance evaluation reports, including the FCQs, peer review of teaching, and, if desired, other types of teaching evaluation, the curriculum vitae, and, if available, the faculty member's Professional Plan(s) from that PTR cycle and the forthcoming cycle. (See Appendix B for more information about the Professional Plan)\nThe PTR committee shall provide an overall evaluation of the faculty member's performance as either outstanding, exceeding expectations, meeting expectations, or below expectations in teaching, research\/creative work, clinical activity, and leadership and service, and shall provide a narrative explanation of that evaluation. \u00a0The PTR committee shall write a brief report stating whether the candidate is meeting expectations or not. The report is an opportunity to evaluate the faculty member's contributions over the past 5 years to the unit, the university, the community (where relevant) and the profession. \u00a0\u00a0The report shall summarize the unit's findings regarding the faculty member's adherence to the department's\/primary unit's standards and conclusions about his\/her productivity and contributions to the University in teaching, research\/creative work, and leadership and service, and when appropriate, clinical work or professional practice. \u00a0A copy of this report will be given to the faculty member by the department chair or dean, depending on whether the PTR is undertaken by the primary unit or school\/college. A copy of the PTR report will be placed in the faculty member's personnel file. The reports will be forwarded to the dean, who will provide a summary report and copies of the individual reports to the provost on the results of all the post-tenure reviews in the college\/school.\u00a0 Annually, the provosts will provide a summary report on post-tenure review to the System Office of Academic Affairs, who will forward the campus summary reports to the president and the Board of Regents.\u00a0\nFaculty members who have achieved summary evaluations of \"meeting expectations\" or better on their annual merit evaluations (see the administrative policy statement \u201cPerformance Ratings for Faculty\u201d) since the last PTR (or since receiving tenure if this is their first PTR) shall undergo Regular Review. \u00a0Faculty members who receive a summary evaluation of \u201cbelow expectations\u201d at any time during a five-year PTR cycle must undertake a Performance Improvement Agreement (See APS on Performance Ratings for Faculty for more information on the Performance Improvement Agreement and Extensive Review).\nFaculty members who fail to participate in any aspect of the post tenure review process, as required, may be subject to sanctions for insubordination and dereliction of duty.\nXII. The Candidates Prerogatives\n\nA candidate shall be entitled to submit any material or information that he\/she believes will be helpful in evaluating her\/his comprehensive review, promotion and\/or tenure at the first-, second-, and third-level review stages. Materials provided at a higher level of the review stage shall also be provided to all other bodies reviewing the candidate, and they may respond as they deem appropriate.\nEach faculty member shall have access to all performance evaluation documents in her\/his own files. These documents shall include statements prepared by primary unit evaluation committees, by department or division chairs, or by administrative officers, but shall not include letters of recommendation solicited from outside the primary unit, which are to be treated as confidential. Each faculty member shall be informed orally and in writing by the head of the primary unit of the results of evaluations of the faculty member's performance.\nIf a candidate so requests, in a confidential conversation, the provost or her\/his representative shall advise the candidate of the reasons that contributed to a recommendation not to grant tenure or promote. After the final decision, a candidate for reappointment, promotion or tenure shall be entitled to file a grievance with the Faculty Senate\u2019s Privilege and Tenure Committee within the allowable time frame (see Regent Policy 5-H) if the candidate believes that the procedures described herein have not been observed at any stage of the recommending or review process. While procedural errors per se may entitle the candidate to proper reconsideration as herein provided, such errors may not be used as the justification for personnel recommendations not otherwise justified on the basis of performance. Nor shall the Privilege and Tenure Committee substitute its judgment about an individual's merit for that of other committees and administrators. The committee shall promptly report any procedural deficiencies to the provost of the campus where the faculty member works.\nA candidate who is denied tenure will have a terminal year before his\/her appointment ends.\nXIII. Tenure and Promotion Policies Specific to Library Faculty Members\n\nLibrarians play a unique role in advancing the University\u2019s educational mission.\u00a0 This APS reaffirms the status of all librarians as members of the faculty, while recognizing the diverse nature of faculty appointments for librarians throughout the University of Colorado system, where library faculty members may be tenured or tenure track, non-tenure-track promotion eligible, or non-tenure track.\u00a0\nLibrarians on University of Colorado campuses where library faculty are eligible for tenure-track appointments and who are appointed or promoted to the rank of assistant professor will be on the tenure track, and the tenure probationary period will begin when they achieve that rank.\u00a0 Evaluation procedures and standards of performance for reappointment, tenure, and promotion for library faculty members are the same as those for other faculty members.\u00a0 The criteria for librarians will include activities in the teaching and\/or practice of librarianship. Primary unit criteria, as described above, articulate the requirements for tenure and promotion.\nXIV.

Academic units or schools\/colleges may require faculty members to prepare and maintain a professional plan after their award of tenure.\nThe professional plan communicates the faculty member's teaching, research\/creative work, and leadership and service goals and explains how these goals support the needs of the primary unit and the college\/school. Projections made in the plan, when compared to the faculty member's progress and achievements, can provide one basis for evaluating the faculty member's professional performance. \u00a0If the Plan calls for a distribution of effort different from the primary unit's standard assignment, a differentiated workload agreement should be included.\nAt the time of annual merit evaluation and during post-tenure review (or extensive review), the primary unit evaluation committee may review the professional plan (and any revisions or updates to the plan) and compare its goals to the actual achievements of the faculty member to date.\u00a0\n1. Information with \u201cmaterial bearing,\u201d such as formal disciplinary action, should only be included if it affects whether or not the candidate meets the primary unit criteria for teaching, research\/creative work, clinical activity or leadership and service.\n2. The School of Medicine\u2019s (SOM) procedures differ in many respects from those described in this APS.

BensonResponsible University Officer:\u00a0Vice President, Employee and Information ServicesResponsible Office:\u00a0Vice President, Employee and Information ServicesPolicy Contact:\u00a0Office of the Vice President, Employee and Information ServicesSupersedes:\u00a0February 24, 2012Last Reviewed\/Updated date:\u00a0July 1, 2014Applies to:\u00a0Universitywide\n\n\n\nThe 2010 revision to this policy incorporates a new, 2010 incentive program for faculty, which is described in Section IV.B.7. The 2011 revision to this policy adds an additional incentive program, which is described in Section IV.B.8.\nOn October 6, 2005, the Board of Regents passed a resolution authorizing the president to expand retirement incentive options available for faculty so long as they are consistent with regent laws and policies, university administrative policy statements, and the laws and fiscal rules of the state of Colorado.\nOn March 12, 2009, the Board of Regents approved a second, related resolution to authorize the president to develop retirement incentive options for faculty in addition to those in effect at that time.\nII. Policy Statement\n\n\nThe chancellor of each campus is authorized to approve individual retirement incentive agreements for faculty on the chancellor\u2019s campus who are not retiring under the Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) retirement plan. The chancellor may delegate this authority to the campus vice chancellor for academic affairs or provost. The reference to \u201cchancellor\u201d throughout this document includes the chancellor\u2019s designee, if any.\nAn individual retirement incentive agreement is authorized only if it complies with the requirements below. The chancellor has discretion over whether to approve a retirement incentive agreement. The chancellor may limit the number of faculty on the campus entering into retirement incentive agreements in any given year based on the needs of the affected unit, the school or college, and the campus. Before approving a retirement incentive agreement, the chancellor must be satisfied that the agreement meets the overall needs of the University. No faculty member has a right to such an agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the retirement incentive agreement the faculty member\u2019s employment during the term of the agreement shall be subject to all applicable University policies and procedures.\nFaculty members who wish to retire with the benefits available under normal retirement policies shall not be required to execute retirement incentive agreements.\n\nIII. Eligibility Requirements for Retirement Incentive Agreements\n\n\nFaculty entering into retirement incentive agreements must meet the eligibility requirements described in this policy.\nA retirement incentive agreement must include the faculty member\u2019s irrevocable agreement to retire on a specified date. For retirement incentive agreements other than under the retirement incentive program inaugurated in 2010 and described, below, in IV.7, the specified date shall not be later than five (5) years after the effective date of the agreement. A faculty member who has entered into a phased retirement incentive agreement may withdraw his or her agreement to retire or change the effective date of retirement only with the written agreement of the chancellor. A faculty member who has entered into a retirement incentive agreement may terminate the agreement early without the consent of the chancellor by resigning his\/her University employment or, if eligible to retire under normal University policies, by retiring earlier than the specified retirement date. Under such circumstances, upon such resignation or retirement, the faculty member will receive only those employment or retirement benefits provided under normal University policies.\nAn individual retirement incentive agreement shall include only the retirement incentives authorized in this policy. An agreement may include more than one incentive, except for the 2010 retirement incentive program.\nAs appropriate to the faculty member\u2019s workload assignment during the term of a retirement incentive agreement, the faculty member may be required to release in an orderly manner the research or laboratory space he or she occupies. Ordinarily, the retirement incentive agreement should include provisions for the manner and timing of this release, except for the 2010 retirement incentive program.\nThe faculty member shall agree to relinquish his\/her tenure on the date which shall be specified in the retirement incentive agreement. No other waiver of rights is required for a retirement incentive agreement.\nEach retirement incentive agreement must be signed by the faculty member and the chancellor prior to its effective date.\nEach retirement incentive agreement must be reviewed and approved for legal sufficiency by the Office of University Counsel before being signed.\nA copy of the completed retirement incentive agreement must be forwarded to Payroll and Benefit Services for processing prior to the effective date of the agreement.\nCosts associated with implementing retirement incentive agreements must be funded within existing campus or unit budgetsBudgetA set of financial expectations (usually revenues and\/or expenditures) for a given fiscal period (at least annually)., as determined by the chancellor.\n\nIV. Retirement Incentives for Tenured and Tenure-Track Faculty\n\n\nEligibility\n\tFaculty who are tenured or tenure-track and who are employed at fifty percent time or greater and meet at least the minimum combined age and years of service requirements contained in Regent Policy 11.F.3.b are eligible for retirement incentive agreements under the terms of this section..\u00a0 In the School of Medicine, Clinical Practice Series faculty members at the ranks of associate professor or professor are also eligible to participate in these retirement incentive agreements, subject to the age and service requirements contained in Regent Policy 11.F.3.b.\u00a0\nAuthorized Incentives\n\t\nNegotiated Differentiated Work Load\n\t\t\nAn eligible faculty member who is interested in retiring may negotiate a differentiated workload for a specified period in exchange for the faculty member\u2019s agreement to retire at the end of the period. A faculty member who is working under a negotiated differentiated workload would continue to be benefits-eligible.\nThe following provide additional authority for this incentive: 1) Administrative Policy Statement, \u201cDifferentiated Annual Workloads for Faculty,\u201d July 1, 2007, which permits the assignment of differentiated workloads for faculty on an annual basis; 2) Regent Policy 11.B.2.c.(1), which permits evaluation of faculty based upon the assigned differentiated workload; and 3) Regent Law, Article 11.A.1.(E), \u201cDetermination of Salaries for Faculty, Officers, and University Staff.\u201d\n\nPost-retirement University Employment or Consulting Opportunities\n\t\t\nThe chancellor may set aside one year of the faculty member\u2019s pre-retirement base salary and agree to contract with the faculty member for consulting services after the date of retirement for a fee up to the amount of the set-aside. The consulting contract may be a multi-year contract so long as adequate funds are reserved to pay fees for the entire term of the contract and the faculty member meets the tests required to establish that the faculty member is performing consulting services as an independent contractor.\nThe chancellor may set aside one year of the faculty member\u2019s pre-retirement base salary and agree to enter into an employment contract with the faculty member for services after retirement. The compensation provided under the employment contract may be up to the amount of the set-aside.\n\t\t\t\nIf the employment contract is for research services, the contract may be for a term, but generally the term should not exceed two years.\nIf the employment contract is for services other than research services (e.g. teaching, student advising, administering departmental or campus centers, of filling a service role), the faculty member must be an at-will employeeEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. in the post-retirement position. The chancellor may not commit to a term contract for services other than research services, and the employment contract must clearly state that the faculty member is an employee at-will.\n\nWhile the agreed-upon period of the post-retirement consulting or employment must be limited in the retirement incentive agreement, this limitation is not intended to preclude subsequent employment of a retired faculty member after the agreed-upon period if both the chancellor and the retired faculty member agree to such subsequent employment. Faculty members who are employed after retirement from the University will receive benefits as retirees, not as regular employees.\n\nIncreases to Out-of-State Retiree Medical Insurance Contributions\n\n\t\tAs part of a retirement incentive agreement, the University may agree to increase the eligible employer contribution (which is based on age and number of years of service at the time of retirement) to medical insurance by adding an additional 50% for those retirees who reside outside the State of Colorado and elect one of the University\u2019s medical insurance plans. This additional contribution may continue only until the retiree and spouseSpouseThe spouse of an employee pursuant to a marriage recognized by the laws of the State of Colorado, if such spouse is not divorced or legally separated from the employee., civil union partnerCivil union partnerThe civil union partner of an employee in a civil union that satisfies the requirements of the Colorado Civil Union Act, C.R.S. \u00a7 14-15-101, et seq., if the employee and civil union partner have not dissolved the partnership and are not legally separated.1, or same gender domestic partner reach the age of eligibility for Medicare. The employer contribution shall not exceed 100% of the total medical insurance premium cost. Should the retiree move back to the State of Colorado, the additional employer contribution must be eliminated until such time as the retiree again resides outside the State of Colorado, prior to reaching Medicare eligibility.\nIncrease in Base Salary\n\t\t\nThe chancellor may agree to increase the faculty member\u2019s base academic year faculty salary for two years preceding the faculty member\u2019s retirement date. The agreed-upon increase may be up to 6% over and above the average faculty salary increment for the faculty member\u2019s campus.\nRegent Policy 11.B.2.f\u00a0provides additional authority for this incentive.\n\nPhased Retirement Program\n\t\tThe chancellor may agree to a phased retirement program for an eligible faculty member for a period of up to five (5) years as described in Attachment A.\nAny of the additional benefits and salary provided to eligible faculty may result in increased taxes. The University will comply with tax withholding rules for federal, state and local government.\nTax-deferred Retirement Incentive Program\n\t\t\nIn exchange for the tenured faculty member\u2019s agreement to immediately retire and relinquish her\/his tenure rights, the chancellor may agree to a retirement incentive equal to twice the professor\u2019s base salary and supplemental pay, if any, at the time the agreement is executed. Such incentive payment typically shall take the form of annual university payments into a 403(b) retirement plan over a five-year period, up to annual limits established by the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe retired faculty member forfeits the right to any benefits under his or her retirement incentive agreement if he or she subsequently becomes an employee of the university during any year in which he or she is receiving the five annual incentive contributions into his or her 403(b) retirement account (the \u201cRestricted Period\u201d). No taxable income of any kind may be received by the faculty member during the Restricted Period, including accrued sick and vacation leave payments. In addition, the faculty member shall make no elective deferral into the University of Colorado 403(b) Plan that is allocable to any calendar year during the Restricted Period.\nThese agreements are subject to numerous restrictions imposed by the IRS because they involve contributions to the 403(b) plan and, potentially, deferred compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Accordingly, any requested changes must be reviewed and approved. Campus human resources offices should seek approval from the Senior Associate Vice President for Human Resources who, with the assistance of University Counsel, will review and approve any requested changes.\u00a0\nEligibility criteria contained in III. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR RETIREMENT INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS, apply to the 2010 Retirement Incentive Program unless otherwise noted.\n\nCash Payment Taxable Retirement Incentive Program\n\t\t\nIn exchange for the tenured faculty member\u2019s agreement to immediately retire and relinquish his\/her tenure rights, the Chancellor may agree to a retirement incentive that shall not exceed twice the faculty member\u2019s base faculty salary at the time the agreement is executed. Such incentive payment shall take the form of a one-time, taxable cash payment to be paid on or after the retirement date, but no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the retirement date occurs.\nThe incentive agreement may include the opportunity to continue after retiring in a faculty teaching, research, and\/or creative activities role as needed for a defined period of time at the discretion of the Chancellor in consultation with the Provost and Dean.\n\n\n\nV. Retirement Incentive Agreements for Non-Tenure-Track Faculty\n\nThe authorized incentive for non-tenure track faculty is the phased retirement program described in\u00a0Attachment B.\nVI. \u00a0Information and Education\n\n\nThe President\u2019s office shall issue an annual report documenting: (1) the number of faculty retiring in the previous fiscal year; (2) the number retiring under individual retirement incentive agreements by campus; (3) the categories of faculty.\nThe Office of Employee Services shall periodically provide educational sessions for faculty related to retirement options.\n\nVII. \u00a0Interpretation\n\nQuestions concerning the policy and its interpretation should be directed to the campus human resources, University Counsel, provost\u2019s offices or to the Associate Vice President for Employee Services.\nVIII. \u00a0History\n\n\nOriginal policy effective July 1, 1999\nRevised January 28, 2000\nRevised June 6, 2007\nRevised July 1, 2011\nRevised February 24, 2012\nMinor revision to Attachment A effective July 1, 2014\nThe term civil union partner was added in May 2014 to reflect new State law regarding Civil Unions.\nThe policy was updated on October 4, 2017, to clarify that Clinical Practice Series faculty members at the ranks of associate professor or professor in the School of Medicine are eligible to participate in these retirement incentive agreements, subject to the age and service requirements contained in Regent Policy 11.F.3.\n\nIX. \u00a0Key Words\n\nFaculty, incentive, retirement, benefits\nATTACHMENT A - PHASED RETIREMENT PROGRAM FOR TENURED AND TENURE-TRACK FACULTY\n\nI. \u00a0 \u00a0 Eligibility\nAll tenured and tenure track faculty members who are employed at fifty percent time or greater and: 1) will be at least 55 years of age by the end of the term of the phased retirement agreement; and \u00a02) whose age and years of half time or greater service at the university total at least 652\u00a0are eligible to participate in this phased retirement program (\u201cProgram\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0\u201d). \u00a0\u00a0At the School of Medicine, associate professors and professors in the Clinical Practice Series may also participate in this phased retirement program, subject to the conditions listed above.\nII. \u00a0 \u00a0 Terms and Provisions\n\nTerm of the Program\n\n\tThe agreed term of a Program for an eligible faculty member may be from one semester to up to five academic years. At the joint request of the department chair (or primary unit\/division head) and the faculty member, and with the concurrence of the dean (if not the primary unit\/division head specified above) and the chancellor, a Program with an initial term of less than five academic years may be renewed beyond the initial term for up to a maximum of five academic years total (including both the initial term and subsequent renewals). The faculty member shall agree to relinquish his\/her tenure at the end of the term of the Program. In order for the Program to be renewed beyond the initial term the chancellor and the faculty member must agree to change the previously agreed upon retirement date.\nWorkload and Duties\n\t\nWorkload commitments and duties during the term of the Program must be described in the retirement incentive agreement.\nPay level and workload must remain at an average of 25% or higher over the term of the Program. Additionally, the faculty member must be paid at least 25% of full-time salary for each semester. The following are examples of acceptable pay and workload agreements.\n\t\t\nThe faculty member may work 25% time at 25% pay during each academic year of the Program.\nThe faculty member may work 50% time in year one, 0% time in year two and 25% time in year three at 25% of pay each academic year during a three-year term. (Under such an arrangement, the faculty member must be paid at 25% of full-time salary for each\u00a0academic year. The faculty member may not be paid 50% in year one and 0% in year two).\nThe faculty member may work 75% time each academic year at 75% pay.\nThe faculty member may work full time (100%) in the fall semester and be relieved of all responsibilities during the spring semester, averaging a 50% workload and 50% pay over the academic year. (Under such an arrangement, the faculty member would be paid at 50% of full pay for the entire academic year. The faculty member may not be paid 100% in the fall semester and 0% in the spring semester.)\n\nFaculty members may not be paid in advance for work not yet performed. For example, the faculty member may not work 0% time in the first academic year of the Program and 100% time during the second academic year and be paid at 50% of full-time salary for the first year. In any case where the faculty member receives a greater percentage of pay than workload for any semester or year, the faculty member must have had a corresponding greater percentage of workload than pay in a previous year or semester.\nAgreed-upon duties may include teaching, clinical, research, and service\/administrative duties. Ordinarily, duties should include both classroom teaching and service duties.\nWorkload commitments and duties during the term of the Program must be approved by the department chair (or primary unit\/division head), the dean of the academic unit (if not the primary unit\/division head specified above), and the chancellor. The percent workload and agreed upon duties may be renegotiated on an annual basis with the consent of the faculty member, the chancellor, the department chair (or primary unit\/division head), and the dean of the academic unit (if not the primary unit\/division head specified above). The retirement incentive agreement must be modified to reflect agreed upon changes to the percentage of workload and duties.\nFaculty members who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for a sabbatical assignment under Regent Law Article 5.B.3(C) may, with the approval of their department chair (or primary unit\/division head), the dean of the academic unit (if not the primary unit\/division) and the chancellor, include a sabbatical as part of their proposed workload commitments and duties during the term of the Program. The same processes and criteria for approval of sabbaticals shall apply as enumerated in Regent Policy 5-A. Similarly, rules and procedures contained in Regent Policy 5-A. Similarly, rules and procedures contained in Regent Policy 5-A and Regent Action 2\/24\/68: amended 3\/17\/88, 1\/20\/94 and 10\/20\/94 shall apply. The one difference in treatment of faculty on sabbatical as part of the Program is that instead of the requirement that the faculty member return to the university for a least one full year after the sabbatical, a faculty member in the Program shall return for as many years as required to complete the equivalent of one year of full time work following the sabbatical.3\n\nBenefits\n\t\nThe retirement plan contributions by the university (ordinarily 10% of full-time salary) will be paid to faculty in Programs at two times the negotiated workload percentage (e.g., a faculty member working at a reduced workload of 40% will receive a university retirement contribution based on 80% of salary, equaling an 8% university contribution). In no case will a faculty member receive an employer contribution in excess of 10% of full-time salary.4\nUniversity contributions to group insurance plans (including health, dental, and life insurance provided by the university) during the term of the Program shall continue as if the faculty member were at 100% time.\nUpon reaching age 59\u00bd, when entered in a Program, the employee may begin retirement plan distributions as permitted under the terms of the retirement plan and IRS regulations.\n\nAdditional Terms and Conditions\n\t\nA request for participation in a Program should be filed with the department chair (or primary unit\/division head) by December 1 for a Program to begin in the following fall semester. A request should be made by May 1 for a Program to begin the following spring semester. The chancellor should notify the faculty member whether the request is granted or denied by no later than March 31 for the fall semester or September 30 for the spring semester (or later for requests not filed by the due dates). Requests filed after the due dates may be considered untimely.\nDuring the term of a Program, the university must continue to be the faculty member\u2019s primary professional commitment. A faculty member on phased retirement may not accept a full-time position with another employer or a tenured part-time position at another education institution.\nFaculty in Programs must continue to participate in annual evaluations, post-tenure review (unless waived in the retirement agreement), and other applicable faculty personnel processes.\nShould a program be terminated prior to the end of its term, the faculty member shall be compensated for work already performed if in excess of salary received but shall not receive additional compensation or benefits under the Program.\u00a0\n\n\nATTACHMENT B - PHASED RETIREMENT PROGRAM NON-TENURE-TRACK FACULTY\n\nI. \u00a0 \u00a0 Eligibility\nAll non-tenure-track faculty members who are employed at fifty percent time or grater and: 1) will be at least 55 years of age by the end of the period of the phased retirement program (\u201cProgram\u201d); and 2) whose age and years of half time or greater service at the university total at least 655\u00a0are eligible to participate in the Program.\nII. \u00a0 \u00a0 Terms and Provisions\n\nTerm of the Agreement.\n\n\tThe agreed term of a Program for a non-tenure-track faculty member may be from one semester to up to one academic year.\nWorkload and Duties.\n\t\nWorkload commitments and duties during the term of the Program must be described in the retirement incentive agreement.\nPay level and workload must remain at an average of 25% or higher over the term of the Program. Additionally, the faculty member must be paid at 25% of full-time salary for each semester. The following are examples of acceptable pay and workload agreements.\n\t\t\nThe faculty member may work 25% time at 25% pay during each semester.\nThe faculty member may work 50% time in the first semester and 0% time in the second semester (Under such an arrangement, the faculty member must be paid at 25% of full-time salary during each semester. The faculty member may not be paid 50% in the first semester and 0% in the second semester).\nThe faculty member may work 75% time each semester at 75% pay; or\nThe faculty member may work 100% time in the fall semester and be relieved of all responsibilities during the spring semester, averaging a 50% workload and 50% pay over the academic year. (Under such an arrangement, the faculty member must be paid at 50% of full-time salary for the entire academic year. The faculty member may not be paid 100% in the fall semester and 0% in the spring semester.)\n\nFaculty members may not be paid in advance for work not yet performed. For example, the faculty member may not work at 0% in the fall semester and 100% in the spring semester and be paid at 50% of full-time salary in the fall semester. In any case where the faculty member receives a greater percentage of pay than workload for any semester, the faculty member must have had a corresponding greater percentage of workload than pay in a previous semester.\nUnless falling within a specific exception described in Colorado law, Colorado law requires that non-tenure-track faculty be at-will employees. All retirement incentive agreements for non-tenure-track faculty must explicitly state those facts and reserve the university\u2019s right to terminate at-will faculty members\u2019 employment and their Programs at any time.\nWorkload commitments and duties during the term of the Program must be approved by the department chair (or primary unit\/division head), the dean of the academic unit (if not the primary unit\/division head specified above), and the chancellor.\n\nBenefits\n\t\nThe retirement plan contributions by the university (ordinarily 10% of full-time salary) will be paid to faculty in Programs at two times the negotiated workload percentage (e.g., a faculty member working at a reduced workload of 40% will receive a university retirement contribution based on 80% of salary, equaling an 8% university contribution). In no case will a faculty member receive an employer contribution in excess of 10% of full-time salary.\nUniversity contributions to group insurance plans (including health, dental, and life insurance provided by the university) during the term of the Program shall continue as if the faculty member were at 100% time.\nUpon reaching age 59\u00bd, when entered in a Program, the employee may begin retirement plan distributions as permitted under the terms of the retirement plan and IRS regulations.\n\nAdditional Terms and Conditions\n\t\nA request for participation in a Program should be filed with the department chair (or primary unit\/division head) by December 1 for a Program to begin in the following fall semester. A request should be made by May 1 for a Program to begin the following spring semester. The chancellor should notify the faculty member whether the request is granted or denied by no later than March 31 for the fall semester or September 30 for the spring semester (or later for requests not filed by the due dates). Requests filed after the due dates may be considered untimely.\nNon-tenure-track faculty in Programs must continue to participate in annual evaluations and other applicable faculty personnel processes.\nShould a retirement incentive agreement be terminated prior to the end of the term of the Program, the faculty member shall be compensated for work already performed if in excess of salary received but shall not receive additional compensation or benefits under the program.\n\n\n1. The term civil union partner was added in May 2014 to reflect new State law regarding Civil Unions.\n2. The faculty member is only eligible to retire once her\/his combined age and years of service total at least 70. If the phased retirement period ends prior to the individual\u2019s age and years of service totaling 70, the faculty member will not receive the University of Colorado retirement benefits available to those who do meet the minimum established age and years of service requirements.\n3. The normal post sabbatical commitment states that: \u201cIn accepting a sabbatical assignment, the faculty member shall agree to return to the university for at least one year thereafter. In case the faculty member is responsible for terminating his\/her connection with the university within the period of one year after expiration of the sabbatical, the individual shall refund the sabbatical remuneration to the university on a prorated basis, except in exceptional circumstances, including permanent disability or death, wherein neither the individual nor the heirs shall be obligated to refund any part of the amount paid while on sabbatical.\u201d Regent Action 2\/24\/68; amended 1\/20\/94. \n4. If the salary for the faculty member is paid from grant funds, this benefit is not guaranteed and will be paid only if permitted and funded by the funding agency. \n5. The faculty member is only eligible to retire once her\/his combined age and years of service total at least 70. If the phased retirement period ends prior to the individual\u2019s age and years of service totaling 70, the faculty member will not receive the University of Colorado retirement benefits available to those who do meet the minimum established age and years of service requirements. \n\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\nbenefits \n\nfaculty \n\nincentive \n\nretirement \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy authorizes the chancellors to approve retirement incentive agreements for faculty and describes the requirements of these agreements.

General Policy\n1.a. General Rights of Ownership\n\nWhile current copyright law generally allocates ownership rights to the University as an employer, the University of Colorado \u00a0assigns any \u00a0ownership it has in Educational Materials to the person or people who create such Materials (\u201cauthor(s)\u201d)3.\u00a0 As provided in Regent Policy 5-k, Educational Materials include but are not limited to, textbooks, electronic media, syllabi, tests, assignments, monographs, papers, models, musical compositions, works of art and unpublished manuscripts . Exceptions to this assignment of ownership are:\n\nthose cases in which the production of such materials is a part of sponsored programs;\nthose cases in which the materials are created under the specifically assigned duties of employees other than faculty;\nthose cases in which substantial University resources were used in creating educational materials; and\nthose cases which are specifically commissioned by University contract, or done as part of an explicitly designated assignment made in writing, other than normal faculty scholarly pursuits.\n\nIn cases where it is not clear whether or not these exemptions apply, authors are strongly encouraged to pursue a negotiated written agreement as stipulated in Section 3(c) of this policy.\n1.b. Substantial Use of Resources\n\"Substantial use of resources\" means use of university resources that goes above and beyond those that are customarily and currently provided to University employees.4\u00a0\u00a0University resources include such things as equipment, staff support, supplemental pay, and offloading from regular duties. Decisions about whether use of these resources is \"substantial\" or \"customary and current\" shall be determined by responsible campus administrators, as specified in Section II.2.B . The University of Colorado does not assign to the author(s) its interests in intellectual property created by University employees making substantial use of University resources.\n1.c. Who is Covered by This Policy\nThis policy is applicable to all units of the University including its colleges, schools, departments, centers, institutes, and hospitals, and to all University employees including faculty, instructors, and staff. Employees receiving salaries or other remuneration from the University, including part-time employees, student employees, University employees on sabbatical who receive remuneration from the University, and employees on a leave of absence who are using substantial University resources are bound by this policy. The Vice President for Academic Affairs is the University officer who is authorized to approve exemptions to individuals bound by this policy.\nStudents are covered under this policy under the following circumstances. A student who is not employed by the University or has not used substantial University resources to develop educational materials, will own the materials she or he creates, unless the student's work is part of a larger work over which the University has rights and intends to exercise them. Students who are employed by the University will be bound by this Administrative Policy, except that students who hold awards such as scholarships or fellowships through the University on which a funding body has placed restrictions as to intellectual property will be bound by the terms of the award.\n1.d. Rights to Educational Materials\n1.d.1.\u00a0Rights of the person or people who create Educational Materials. Except as provided under Section 1.a above, educational materials created for classroom and learning programs, including electronic media, such as syllabi, assignments, and tests, shall be the property of the author.\n1.d.2.\u00a0Rights of the University of Colorado. While the author(s) shall own the rights to all educational materials developed pursuant to Section 1.d.1 herein, the University of Colorado shall be permitted to use such educational materials for administrative purposes, such as satisfying requests of accreditation agencies for faculty-authored syllabi, assessments and course descriptions. Such usage shall extend beyond employment with the University.\nAdditionally, in the event that a faculty member assigned to teach a course becomes unavailable to teach that course, the University of Colorado shall be permitted to use Educational Materials related to such course for the duration of the semester in which the course was scheduled and until all final grades in the course have been assigned.\n1.d.3.\u00a0Copyright of Professional Journals and Books. Consistent with the terms of this policy, the University assigns any interest and ownership claims on publication of research and\/or other scholarly materials and activities that typically occur in professional\/academic journals, books, and other professional resources. Nothing in this policy shall be construed to restrict or constrain these actions.\n2. Process\n2.a. Duty to Disclose and Reporting Requirements.\u00a0Any person formally affiliated with the University shall be obligated to report in a timely manner any efforts to create educational materials that might fall within exceptions to this policy enumerated in Section II.1.a.\u00a0 Such reporting shall be to the author\u2019s direct supervisor.\n2.b. Designation of responsible authority.\u00a0The campus Chancellor shall designate one or more individuals at the campus level who shall be responsible for undertaking an initial assessment of any matters relating to educational materials, including making a determination as to whether substantial University resources have been used, and whether a negotiated agreement is necessary. Such designee shall seek out appropriate assistance and expertise as may be necessary from the Office of University Counsel, Technology Transfer, Finance, and the author\u2019s academic department and School or College, \u00a0and shall be responsible for developing any such written agreement. The Chancellor shall further designate a central campus repository for all educational material matters, including written agreements and the disposition of any educational material matters.\n2.c. Negotiated Written Agreements\nNegotiated written agreements are required under the following circumstances:\nSubstantial Use of University Resources\nIt is the responsibility of the author to seek clarification of whether the resources being used in the development of educational materials constitutes \"substantial uses of University resources.\" If so, the author should negotiate a written agreement with the University, by and through the person designated in Section II.2.b.\n\"Substantial use of University resources\" in and of itself does not require that ownership rights be automatically shifted to the University. However, depending on the terms of the negotiated contract, \"substantial use of University resources\" may result in an obligation to share revenues, reimburse the University, or confer a license. Ownership rights specified in this policy may be altered by mutual agreement.\nMultiple Parties: If more than one party is responsible for creating specific educational materials, a negotiated written agreement signed by all author(s) and the University shall be required. That agreement shall usually specify (1) the rights of each party to use, distribute, and sell the materials; and (2) the division of revenues between the parties. Parties may include but are not limited to individuals, research teams, external funding agencies, the University, etc.\n2.c.1. A negotiated written agreement should usually specify:\n\nthe rights of the author(s) and the University to use, distribute, and sell the materials;\nthe division of revenues between the University and the author(s);\nthe rights of the University to use and to modify the materials during and after the period of formal association with the University; and\nthe rights of the author(s), the University, and\/or external funding parties to be acknowledged or to withhold acknowledgement in the distribution or modification of the materials by the University.\n\n2.c.2.\u00a0Modifications to Agreements.\u00a0Any negotiated written agreement made in connection with the creation of educational materials may be modified at any time upon the unanimous agreement of all signatories. Such modifications will normally be necessary when changes occur in any of the following:\n\nparticipation of the author(s) in a continuing project;\nthe University's contribution of substantial resources; or\nwhen a dispute is resolved by the Educational Materials Intellectual Property Board through adjudication.\n\n2.c.3.\u00a0Educational Materials Intellectual Property Board\nThe University shall establish a system-wide Educational Materials Intellectual Property Board composed of faculty, administrators, staff, and students, to hear and recommend resolution of disputes related to educational materials intellectual property to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, with final recourse to the University President. The Faculty Assembly from each campus shall appoint a faculty member to represent its campus on the Board. The Board also interprets and oversees the implementation of the policies stated in this document and may advise the Vice President for Academic Affairs about exemptions under this policy.\n3. Review of Policy\nThe University System Faculty Council and System Administration shall jointly review the operation of this policy every three years after its adoption and shall report its effectiveness and any suggested changes to the policy to the Board of Regents.\nIII. \u00a0History\n\n\nInitial policy approved January 16, 2003\nRevised June 1, 2006\nRevised July 1, 2013\n\n1.  \u00a0Throughout this APS, the person or people who create intellectual property, including authors, creators, researchers, and inventors, shall collectively be referred to as \u201cauthors.\u201d\n2. Any term defined in Regent Policy 5-k shall have the same meaning in this APS as it has in Regent Policy 5-k.\n3. A separate policy applies to ownership of discoveries and patents, and nothing in this APS shall affect ownership of such intellectual property. See Administrative Policy Statement (APS), \"Intellectual Property Policy on Discoveries and Patents for their Protection and Commercialization.\"\n4.  As set forth in the APS, \"Intellectual Property Policy on Discoveries and Patents for their Protection and Commercialization:\" \u201c[O]ffices, office equipment, library access, desktop and laptop computers, photocopy equipment, telephone, and fax machines, which are customarily provided would be excluded from determination of substantial use of University resources.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"Creating and disseminating knowledge are fundamental missions for the University of Colorado. The creative environment of the University fosters the development of intellectual property. This policy statement clarifies the rights, responsibilities and rewards for the University and its employees in the development and commercialization of educational materials. The University of Colorado in this policy, as elsewhere, reaffirms its commitment to the principles of academic freedom. The University of Colorado also reaffirms its commitment to encouraging and rewarding authors, creators, researchers and inventors who are developing intellectual property.1\u00a0The University supports the creative works of authors, who will under most circumstances retain broad rights in support of their creative endeavors. This policy does not change the traditional relationship between the University and employees who, independent from using substantial University resources, retain broad rights of ownership of scholarly and artistic works. This policy functions in accord with other University of Colorado policies and federal and state statutes and regulations.2"},{"university":"cu","name":"2004","policy":"\n\nAPS 2004 - Federal Lobbying Activities | University of Colorado\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to main content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0English\nSpanish\nChinese\nFrench\nGerman\nKorean\nLao\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport CU\nCU Careers\nEmployee and Student Portals\nCampuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO SYSTEM\n\n\nBOULDER CAMPUS\nAcademic Programs\nAdmissions Information\nTuition Information\nScholarships\u00a0& Financial Aid\n\n\n\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS CAMPUS\n\nAcademic Programs\nAdmissions Information\nTuition Information\nScholarships & Financial Aid\n\n\n\n\nDENVER CAMPUS\n\nAcademic Programs\nAdmissions Information\nTuition Information\nScholarships & Financial Aid\n\n\n\n\nANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS\n\nAcademic Programs\nAdmissions Information\nTuition Information\nScholarships & Financial Aid\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nAbout the CU SystemMission and Guiding Principles\nCampus Overview\nBoard of Regents\nCU Administrative Offices\nCU Facts and Figures\nBrand and Identity Guidelines\nReports and Publications\nUniversity Policies\n\nNews & InformationCU News and Press Releases\nFocus on CU Faculty\nAthletics\nCommencement Calendars\nCU Advocates\nMedia Contacts\nCU Connections: News and Information for Faculty and Staff\nCU On the Air Podcast\n\nStudentsUniversity of Colorado BoulderVisit Campus Website\nAcademic Programs\nAdmission Information\nAcademic Advising\nTuition Information\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nUniversity of Colorado Colorado SpringsVisit Campus Website\nAcademic Programs\nAdmission Information\nAcademic Advising\nTuition Information\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nUniversity of Colorado DenverVisit Campus Website\nAcademic Programs\nAdmission Information\nAcademic Advising\nTuition Information\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nUniversity of Colorado Anschutz Medical CampusVisit Campus Website\nAcademic Programs\nAdmission Information\nTuition Information\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n\nCommencement Calendar\n\nAlumni & FriendsCU Advocates Program\nCU Link\nCampus Alumni AssociationsCU-Boulder Alumni Association\nUCCS Alumni\nCU Denver Alumni Association\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus Alumni Relations\n\nSupport CU\n\nFaculty & StaffCU Connections: News and information for CU faculty and staff\nCU System Administrative Offices\nEmployee Portal\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nHuman Resources OfficesCU-Boulder HR\nUCCS HR\nCU Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus HR\n\nCU Faculty Council\nCampus Faculty GovernanceCU-Boulder Boulder Faculty Assembly\nUCCS Faculty Assembly\nCU Denver Faculty Assembly\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus Faculty Assembly\n\nStaff GovernanceUniversity of Colorado Staff Council (UCSC)\nCU-Boulder Staff Council\nUCCS Staff Council\nUCCS Professional Exempt Staff Association\nCU Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus Exempt Professional Assembly\nCU Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus Staff Council\nSystem Staff Council\n\nAPS: Code of Conduct\n\nSystem DepartmentsAcademicOffice of Academic Affairs\nFaculty Council | Faculty Senate\nPrivilege and Tenure Committee\nBoettcher Webb-Waring Biomedical Research Award\nColeman Institute for Cognitive Disabilities\n\nAdministrationBoard of Regents\nOffice of the President\nOffice of Government Relations\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\nInternal Audit\n\nAdvancementOffice of Advancement\nWays to Support CU\n\nBudget & FinanceVP Budget and Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nBudget and Finance Office\nUniversity Controller\nProcurement Service Center\nTreasurer\nUniversity Risk Management\n\nCommunicationsUniversity Relations\neComm\nCU Connections: News and information for CU faculty and staff\nCU Advocates\nCU For Colorado\n\nEmployee and Information ServicesEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll, Learning)\nUniversity Information Systems (UIS)\nOffice of Information Security\nSystem Staff Council\nUniversity of Colorado Staff Council\n\nLegalUniversity Counsel\nInternal Audit\n\n\nSupport CU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are hereHomeAPS 2004 -

For purposes of this policy, only administrative officers, as defined by action of the Board of Regents, and members of the Board of Regents, are authorized to act on behalf of the University of Colorado when conducting Federal LobbyingActivities with the federal government. All other University employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. (faculty, administrators, staff) and students are considered to be acting as private citizens when engaging in Federal Lobbying Activities. Exception: University employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. may engage in Federal Lobbying Activities on behalf of the institution if designated by the President or the President\u2019s designee. All such activities must be conducted in accordance with the \u201cGuidelines on Meeting, Testifying, and Correspondence with Federal Congressional Members and Legislative and Executive Branch Officials\u201d.\u00a0\nThis policy is not intended to restrict protected expression by University employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly.. Nor are University employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. restricted from identifying their profession and place of employment in the context of their communication with federal officials. However, in exercising this right, University employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. must make it clear that they are expressing their personal views, and not an official position of the institution.\nIn accordance with federal law, no federal funds may be used for the purpose of making Federal LobbyingContacts, whether \"official\" or individual initiatives. In addition, University employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. who are making personal or private Federal Lobbying Contacts with federal officials may not use university funds or university resources (e.g., stationary, telephones, fax and\/or photocopy machines, computers, or other equipment) for that purpose.\u00a0\nHaving registered with the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate, the University of Colorado must file quarterly reports of its Federal Lobbying Activities. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 mandates that lobbying reports be filed electronically. The lobbying reports must explicitly state whether the client is a state or local government. These reports are to include:\n\t\nissues discussed, including bill numbers and Executive branch actions, if practicable ;\nthe houses of Congress or federal agencies contacted;\na list of the employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. who acted as Federal Lobbyists; and\na \"good faith estimate\" of the expenses incurred (e.g., employee salary costs, postage, travel, telephone charges).\n\n\t\tAdditionally, Federal Lobbyists must disclose twice a year aggregate contributions over $200 to any federal candidate, officeholder, leadership PAC, political party committee, Presidential library foundation, or Presidential inaugural committee; and any contribution to an event, entity, or meeting established or held in honor of or financed or controlled by a legislative or Executive branch official.\n\nAll administrative officers who are authorized to act on behalf of the institution must coordinate their Federal Lobbying Activities with the Office of Government Relations. All employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. who conduct Lobbying Activities on behalf of professional associations and organizations must report those activities to the Office of Government Relations.\u00a0 The \u201cGuidelines on Meeting, Testifying, and Corresponding with Legislative and Executive Branch Officials\u201d provides detailed guidance on how employeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. should maintain records of and report Federal Lobbying Activities.\n\nIII. \u00a0Related Policies, Procedures, Forms, Guidelines and Other Resources\n\n\nAdministrative Policy Statements (APS) and Other Policies\n\t\nAPS on\u00a0State Lobbying Activities\n\nGuidelines\n\t\nGuidelines on Meetings, Testifying and Correspondence with Federal Congressional Members (In Development)\nGuidelines on Inviting Government Officials to Campuses\nCampaign-Related Activities by Members of the University Community\nUniversity of Colorado Federal Communications and Lobbying Report Form\n\nTraining\n\t\nFederal Communications and Lobbying Training\n\n\nIV. \u00a0Definitions\n\nItalicized\u00a0terms\u00a0used in this policy are defined in the Administrative Policy Statement\u00a0Glossary.\u00a0\u00a0Underlined terms\u00a0specific to this policy, which are not found in other Administrative Policy Statements, are defined below.\nFederal Lobbyist\u00a0-\u00a0 means an individual employed or retained by the University who spends at least 20 percent of his or her time over a six month period lobbying members of Congress, Congressional staff, and Presidential and other political appointees in the Executive branch, including federal funding agencies, with regard to the formulation, modification, or adoption of federal legislation; the formulation, modification, or adoption of a federal rule, regulation, executive order, or other federal program, policy, or position; or the administration of a federal program or policy.\u00a0\n\nThese individuals act as the institution's official Federal Lobbyists and are reported on the University's registration with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.\n\nFederal Lobbying Activities\u00a0-\u00a0 means Federal Lobbying Contacts (see below) and efforts in support of Lobbying Contacts, including preparation and planning activities, research, and other background work that is intended for use in Lobbying Contacts.\n\nFederal Lobbying Contact\u00a0-\u00a0 means any oral or written communication to members of Congress, Congressional staff, or\u00a0 Executive branch officials\u00a0on behalf of the institution\u00a0regarding the formulation, modification, or adoption of federal legislation; the formulation, modification, or adoption of a federal rule, regulation, executive order, or other federal program, policy, or position; or the administration of federal program or policy.\u00a0\n\nA Lobbying Contact includes not only direct contacts with federal officials, but also includes background research and planning activities intended expressly as preparation for a Lobbying Contact.\nExamples of Federal\u00a0Lobbying Contacts\u00a0include:\n\nletters, faxes, e-mail messages and telephone calls\nface-to-face meetings with officials or staff\n\nNote\u00a0that research and preparation for such meetings or for the composing of such messages or telephone calls are \"Federal Lobbying Activities.\"\nExamples of communications that are NOT considered\u00a0Federal Lobbying Contacts\u00a0include:\n\nspeeches, articles, or communications made through the mass media\ntestimony given before a committee of Congress or submitted in writing for the public record of a hearing of such committee\ninformation provided in writing in response to a written or oral request by a federal official\ncommunication made in response to a notice in the Federal Register soliciting comments from the public\ncommunications required by subpoena, investigation, or otherwise compelled by law\n\nV. \u00a0History\n\n\nThis policy was originally adopted July 1, 1996.

Excluded from the scope of this policy is intellectual property that is educational materials.\nII. POLICY STATEMENT\n\n\n\nData trusteesData TrusteeSee Section III. Definitions are accountable for managing, protecting, and ensuring the integrity and usefulness of university data. Data trustees have the primary responsibility to ensure the university is following its policies and is in compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Data trustees, in consultation with the Council of Data Trustees, shall identify the criticality and sensitivity of data. Data trustees typically are associated with the business functions of an organization rather than technology functions. Data trustees are appointed by the President, chancellors or their delegates and are typically an administrative officer of the university or departmental director. The president, chancellor may choose to not identify a data trustee for certain data types given risk decisions or administrative, research, or academic needs.\nData custodiansData CustodianSee Section III. Definitions typically have control over a data asset's disposition, whether stored (at rest), in transit, or during creation. Custodians will often have modification or distribution privileges. Data custodians carry a significant responsibility to protect data and prevent unauthorized use. Data custodians are often data providers to data usersData userSee Section III. Definitions. Data trustees or data stewardsData StewardSee Section III. Definitions may also exercise custodial roles and responsibilities. Data custodians typically are associated with IT units within the university, either central IT organizations or IT offices within academic and administrative units.\nData stewards will often have data custodial responsibilities, but are distinguished from custodians by delegated decision-making authority regarding the data. Data stewards may represent data trustees in policy discussions, architectural discussions, or in decision-making forums. Data stewards actively participate in processes that establish business-context and quality definition for data elements. Data stewards are more likely to be associated with business functions than IT functions.\nTo the degree that a data user creates university data and\/or controls the disposition of university data, he or she has responsibility for the custodial care of that data. Data users share responsibility in helping data stewards and custodians manage and protect data by understanding and following the IT and information security policies of the university related to data use.\n\nWhen university units create shared data repositories they take on responsibilities as data custodians. As such units must work with data stewards to ensure that they understand external regulatory and university policy compliance requirements. Data custodians may not extend the use of university data beyond the initial scope without additional review by the appropriate data steward. When shared data repositories are created on third party services, special care must be made to ensure that contracts or service agreements include appropriate security and privacy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the data steward to understand business needs of the university unit and facilitate appropriate access to the required data. The data steward will also coordinate with the campus Information Security OfficerInformation security officerThe person who performs day-to-day management of and is the point of contact for the IT Security Program at the campus level. to ensure that adequate security controls are identified and implemented. Should the data steward have questions regarding the legitimacy of the university unit\u2019s business need the data steward shall validate the need with the data trustee.\n\nData stewards, in consultation with the appropriate Campus Information Security Officer or the Office of Information Security shall publish processes for requesting and monitoring access to data and periodically audit access to data. Data stewards shall, at least annually, provide the data trustee with information regarding the management, protection, and effectiveness of efforts to ensure the integrity and usefulness of university data. For example, how data is being used, identify data quality issues, and report on compliance issues.\n\nThe Chief Information Security Officer shall maintain and publish a list of identified data trustees and data\u00a0stewards for specific data types. The list will also identify the classification of specific data types. Where a single individual maintains multiple roles (e.g., data steward and data custodian) the CISO will provide notice to the Counsel of Data Trustees to ensure the roles do not pose a risk to the university.\n\nEach campus or division Chief Information Officer shall be responsible for providing data management guidance to data trustees and establishing appropriate data governance structures. When data management issues or risks regarding data overlaps between multiple data domains are identified, the appropriate Chief Information Officer and data trustee shall present the issues and recommendations to the CU IT Governance Board for resolution.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\n\nItalicized terms used in this Administrative Policy Statement (APS) are defined in the APS Glossary of Terms or are defined in this section.\n\nData trustee is a party or entity identified with and widely recognized to have primary authority and decision responsibility over a particular collection of university data.

Policy Statement\n\n\nNew Degree Program Approval Process\n\t\nCampus Review Process\n\t\t\nA proposed degree program shall be consistent with the applicable academic strategic plan.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nA proposal shall be developed by the faculty of any academic unit and forwarded to the dean of the school\/college for review and approval.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nFaculty within the college\/school shall be notified of the proposed program.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nWhere proposals involve more than one school or college, all participating units shall participate in the review process.\u00a0\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nGraduate degree programs may be subject to additional campus review and approval processes, as determined by the provost.\n\n\t\t\tProposals approved by the dean(s) are forwarded to the provost and chancellor for further review, approval and submission to the system office. A record of campus reviews and approvals shall be included with the proposals.\n\nSystem Review Process\n\n\t\tThe vice president for academic affairs shall review the proposal and associated documents before the proposal is forwarded to the Board of Regents. The vice president shall verify compliance with CCHE and regent policies.\n\t\t\u00a0\nReview and Action by the Board of Regents\n\n\t\tFollowing board protocol, the vice president for academic affairs shall, with the concurrence of the president, place the proposal on the agenda of the next appropriate meeting, and ultimately, on the board agenda for final approval.\n\n\t\tIf the Board of Regents approves the proposed degree, the vice president for academic affairs shall notify CCHE for appropriate review and action.\n\t\t\u00a0\nProgram Implementation\n\n\t\tEach year, the vice president for academic affairs shall report to the Board of Regents on programs approved within the previous five years. The reports shall compare current enrollment and degree totals with the projections provided in the original proposals. As appropriate, other measures may be included to further describe the progress of the program.\n\nGuidelines for Program Proposals\n\t\nProgram Description\n\t\t\nDescribe the basic design of the proposed program, including the degree level (baccalaureate, masters, doctoral, professional), field of study, and whether it is an interdisciplinary program.\n\t\t\t\nIf the degree program will subsume or supplant an existing degree program, the proposal for the new program shall address the need for the discontinuance of the existing program.\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nExplicitly state the outcomes for students of this program, i.e., what can a student expect to learn during the course of the program and what skills will a student have after completing it?\n\nWorkforce and Student Demand\n\t\t\nWorkforce Demand: Supply evidence of the opportunities available to graduates of this program.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nStudent Demand: Describe the target market and demonstrate evidence of student demand for this program.\n\t\t\t\nProvide realistic enrollment projections for the program for the first five years (template provided in the appendix to this APS). \u200b\n\n\t\t\t\tExplain the methodology and assumptions used to project enrollment and completion data. \u00a0Relevant information might include national or regional enrollment trends in similar programs and projected new demand from industry in the service area.\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\nIf applicable, explain how the program design will address the needs of part-time, working students.\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\nDiscuss plans or the potential for online delivery.\n\n\nRole and Mission Criteria\n\n\t\tDescribe how it supports the mission and fits with the applicable strategic plan of the campus.\u00a0 Identify particular institutional strengths in the proposed program area.\n\t\t\u00a0\nDuplication\n\n\t\tAddress duplication issues with other institutions in the CU system or elsewhere in the state of Colorado. Describe any unique characteristics or features of this program that are not duplicated elsewhere in the state that would justify the program. Address the impact of duplication on student demand.\n\t\t\u00a0\nStatutory Requirements\n\n\t\tDescribe how the proposed program conforms to statutory requirements, such as the 120 credit hour limit for undergraduate degrees, GT Pathways and the Student\u2019s Bill of Rights.\n\t\t\u00a0\nCurriculum Description\n\t\t\nDescribe the program requirements, including total credit hours, credit hour distribution, methods of delivering the program, field experience, and other pertinent aspects of the curriculum. Explain how this curriculum is like or unlike the usual curriculum in this field.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nProvide a sample curriculum for the program and explicitly identify all new courses being created for it.\n\nProfessional Requirements or Evaluations\n\t\t\nWhere pertinent, describe any regional or professional accrediting association or licensing requirements that helped shape the curriculum of the proposed program. Specify the effect of these requirements on the length of the program, restrictions on program content or mode of delivery, and any budgetary requirements, such as minimal staffing levels, and equipment needs.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nIdentify timetables, if needed, that have been established to meet the professional requirements.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nDescribe qualifications of the proposed program\u2019s faculty.\n\nInstitutional Factors\n\t\t\nExplain how the implementation of this program will affect other instructional, research, or service programs on campus. Describe the impact on existing resources, including libraries, educational spaces, and computer and laboratory resources. Explain how the implementation will affect other CU campuses.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nWhen a new program fundamentally depends upon a department in a different school\/college, a letter of support from that school\/college\u2019s dean shall be included with the proposal.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nDescribe formal relationships with other parties that are anticipated, such as inter-institutional arrangements, resource sharing, cooperative programs, clinical affiliations, etc. Describe and explain the type and extent of the relationship and the resources that the affiliating institution will provide. A copy of any draft contracts or agreements shall be included as appendices.\n\nPhysical Capacity and Needs\n\t\t\nProvide space estimates for program space requirements. Base the projections on existing and five-year space planning assumptions and program size data from curriculum and student load projections and projected use of special or dedicated facilities, such as laboratories.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nDescribe program delivery and space requirements, identifying additional space or equipment needs. When significant capital construction or equipment needs are anticipated, provide additional information and explanations.\n\nCost Description and Source of Funds\n\t\t\nReport cost estimates and sources of funds for five years, using the template provided in the appendix to this APS, including the definitions and instructions provided with the template. All cost and revenue projections for the five years shall be given in constant dollars, i.e., do not include an inflation factor. The provost\u2019s office shall include and clearly identify institutional overhead costs. Specifically, when tuition is shown as a source of revenue, any component of tuition returned to campus must be shown as an expense.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nProgram costs shall include operating, faculty start-up, and capital start-up needs. Estimates of operating costs shall be based on the delivery of the courses and services defined for the program. Administrative costs shall be factored in. Program budgets shall be calculated in a realistic manner. For example, additional work generated by the operation, management, and oversight of a new program shall not be claimed to be absorbed into the workload of existing staff and faculty without an explanation of what other work will be reassigned or discontinued to make room for the new workload.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\nA proposal shall include a written statement from the dean verifying adequacy of resources to support the new program, as outlined in the program\u2019s budget, and confirming that projected resources are reasonable.\n\nOther Relevant Information\n\n\t\tCampuses may include any other information deemed relevant to support new program proposals. The Board of Regents may request additional information pertinent to specific issues raised during their examination of new degree program proposals.\n\n\nIII.

The number of hours that may be taken on a pass\/fail basis and credited toward a graduate degree is determined by graduate school policy.\u00a0 However, for both undergraduate and graduate degrees, schools and colleges may have additional requirements and may allow fewer pass\/fail credit hours.\u00a0 The curriculum for an individual program or major may further limit allowable pass\/fail hours.\nStudents should check with their academic advisors and degree audit information \u00a0to determine the availability of pass\/fail grading.\nThe record of pass\/fail registration is maintained by the Registrar\u2019s office in the student information system.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Course Forgiveness\/Repetition\n\nAny policy on course forgiveness\/repetition shall apply only to the campus whose faculty develops and adopts it and shall apply only to the students enrolled on that campus.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Drop\/Add Procedure\n\n\nStudents will be allowed to drop and add within a period specified by the campus or its individual schools and colleges.\n\t\u00a0\nThe add period may be no longer than the first 15% of the academic term, (as mandated by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education.)\n\t\u00a0\nStudents seeking to add a course after the initial add period must obtain the instructor's permission.\n\t\u00a0\nAfter the initial drop period, the student must obtain the instructor's permission in order to drop. All courses dropped after the conclusion of the initial drop period appear on the permanent record with the grade of W.\n\t\u00a0\nAfter the 10th week, courses may not be dropped unless there are circumstances clearly beyond the student's control (accident, illness, etc.) In addition to the instructor's certification (as in 4 above), the student must petition his or her dean's office for approval to drop the course. Campuses, individual schools and colleges may have further restrictions on this time period.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Withdrawal Procedure\n\nIn order to withdraw from the University, the student must obtain approval of the academic dean's office and the Office of the Registrar. Notation is recorded on the student's permanent record. Students who do not officially withdraw are subject to grades of F for all course work.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amendments and Exceptions to the Policy\n\nNo change in the Uniform Grading Policy shall be adopted unless it meets with the approval of the voting faculty within 60% of the schools and colleges.\nAny campus, school, or college may request a special grading policy to meet its needs. (An example is the use of H\/HP\/P\/PR\/F at the School of Medicine; H = honors, HP = high pass, P = pass, PR = pass with remediation, F = fail.) Such a request for exception shall be subject to approval by the Faculty Council, after review by the Educational Policy and University Standards committee (EPUS), and shall apply only to that particular unit. Current exceptions include:\n\nThe School of Medicine proposed an extension to their exception to the grading symbols to include H\/HP\/P\/PR\/F.\u00a0 This proposal was approved by the Faculty Council with an effective date of April 1, 2009.\u00a0\nThe School of Dental Medicine proposed an extension to their exception to the grading symbols to include PR (pass with remediation).\u00a0 This proposal was approved by the Faculty Council with an effective date of April 27, 2018.\n\nAll changes to the Uniform Grading Policy must be initiated by the faculty of one or more academic units who will vote upon the change. Such requests for change shall be forwarded to the Executive Committee of the Faculty Council; the Executive Committee of Faculty Council shall consult the Educational Policy and University Standards committee (EPUS) before requiring the schools and colleges to conduct a ballot of their faculties regarding the change. (Faculty within the schools and colleges shall vote in accord with their established policies and procedures.) Following the positive outcome of such a ballot, the Chair of the Faculty Council shall request the administration to make any necessary revisions in this Administrative Policy Statement.\nIII. \u00a0History\n\n\nRevised - July 1, 2014 replaces the January 17, 2013 version.\nJanuary 17, 2013 replaces the 1974, 1984, 1993, 2004, and 2009 documents entitled \u201cUniform Grading System.\u201d\nAdded exception approved by Faculty Council effective April 27, 2018.\n\nIV. \u00a0Key Words\n\nUniform grading, pass\/fail\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\npass\/fail \n\nuniform grading \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"The University has had a uniform grading policy since 1974.

Policy Statement\n\n\nTransfer of Lower-Division General Education Requirements\n\n\tColorado policy ensures that students who have successfully completed state guaranteed general education courses (known as \"gtPathways\" courses) will receive up to 31 transfer credits applied to graduation requirements at all public institutions unless a specific statewide articulation agreement exists. Receiving institutions will apply gtPathways course credit to a student's general education or elective requirements. Application of gtPathways credit toward the major will be determined by the receiving campus, since approved courses in gtPathways are not based on course equivalencies, but rather meet content and competency criteria.\n\n\tLower-division courses not approved for gtPathways credit, but designated in the sending institution's catalog as a general education course within a specific content area (e.g., arts and letters, social science, natural science, etc.) will be applied toward the credit hour and distribution requirements at the receiving institution within the same category.\n\t\u00a0\nApplicability of Individual Upper-Division Courses\n\t\nIt is the policy of the University of Colorado to accept and give credit to individual courses offered at one of the CU campuses that are comparable to those offered by any other general campus. Course equivalency will be based on course title, course description and course content as evaluated by faculty or advisors in the discipline. Campuses may wish to consider developing course equivalency tables in order to facilitate the transfer process and reduce the number of appeals.\nApplicability of coursework will be the purview of the campus to which the student transfers.\nIn cases where course equivalency is questioned, the appeals process described in this policy shall apply.\n\nRequirements for Departmental Evaluations\n\t\nEach campus shall require that departmental evaluations for students who have confirmed their transfer from another campus be completed and the student notified within thirty (30) calendar days after all the official transcripts and Office of Admissions' course evaluations are received in the department. If a student is not notified within thirty (30) calendar days of that date, or his\/her transfer request is denied, the student is entitled to submit an appeal. The department must respond within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the appeal is filed.\nA student may request a departmental evaluation of program requirements each time the student files a change of major or a change in degree plan. These evaluations will become part of the student's academic file.\n\nResolution of Student Disputes\n\t\nInter-campus transfer appeals process. Each campus shall establish a single transfer appeals process that includes at minimum an opportunity to appeal the following:\n\t\t\nThe initial transcript evaluation\nA decision regarding the transferability of a specific course(s)\nA decision regarding the applicability or placement of a specific course(s)\n\nAppeals regarding intercampus transfer that cannot be resolved at the campus level will follow the guidelines set down by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education in the Statewide Transfer Policy for Colorado Public Institutions of Higher Education.\n\n\nIII.

The committee should meet on a quarterly basis to discuss processes, priorities, problems, technical matters and other issues related to campus planning and facility management.\u00a0\nCapital Construction Monitoring and Reporting\u00a0- Recent legislation has allowed the university to streamline project approvals placing more emphasis on project reporting and documentation.\u00a0 Campuses are responsible for the following reports:\n\t\t\nProject Documentation and Project Status Report \u2013 Project documentation as required by the Office of the State Architect, campus policies, and the university policy on record retention shall be kept by the campus.\u00a0 Each campus will provide, on a quarterly basis, a project status report.\u00a0 \u201cProjects\u201d reported on this form will include all activities defined as capital construction by this policy.\u00a0 The quarterly report will be submitted to the Board of Regents Capital Construction Subcommittee.\nFacility Space Inventory - The campus must maintain an accurate physical space inventory of all buildings it owns or leases per\u00a0Appendix 4 \u2013 Facility Space Inventory.\nAnnual and Miscellaneous Reporting \u2013 Annual reports required by state statute, the Office of the State Architect and the Colorado Department of Higher Education shall be coordinated through the system office.\u00a0 Requests for specific facility-related data may come from the Colorado General Assembly, the Colorado Department of Higher Education, or the federal government.\u00a0 Campuses should notify and copy the Vice President for Budget and Finance or his\/her designee of these requests.\n\n\n\nIII. \u00a0Definitions\nFor the purposes of this policy, capital construction is defined according to Section 24-30-1301 C.R.S. Capital construction projects arise out of the university's need to create, expand, relocate, or alter a program due to growth, advances in technology, or changes in methods of program delivery. Projects addressing physical space requirements needed to accommodate particular functions, such as those traditionally included in facility programs, constitute program-driven requests and therefore are considered to be capital construction projects.\u00a0 The following section includes paraphrased definitions, for complete statutory definitions, see Section 24-30-1301 C.R.S.\n\nCapital construction is defined according to Section 24-30-1301 (2) C.R.S.\n\t\nFor purposes on this policy, capital construction means:\n\t\t\nAcquisition or disposition of real property;\nConstruction, demolition, renovation or remodeling of any real property;\nSite improvement or development;\nInstallation of fixed or movable equipment after construction or renovation;\nContracting for architects, engineers or other planning consultants; or\nInstallation, development or upgrade of Information Technology.\n\n\nCapital assets is defined according to Section 24-30-1301 (1) C.R.S.\n\t\nFor purposes on this policy, capital assets means:\n\t\t\nReal property;\nInformation Technology (except personal computers, laptops, printers);\nFixed equipment; or\nMovable equipment (except if instructional or scientific).\n\n\nControlled maintenance is defined according to Section 24-30-1301(4) C.R.S.\u00a0 Controlled maintenance projects arise out of the deterioration of a facility's physical and functional condition and the inability to comply with current codes. These are defined as maintenance-driven requests, as opposed to program-driven requests that constitute capital construction projects.\n\t\nFor purposes on this policy, controlled maintenance means:\n\t\t\nCorrective repairs or replacement, including improvements for health, life safety, and code requirements, used for existing real property.\nCorrective repairs or replacement, including improvements for health, life safety, and code requirements, of the fixed equipment necessary for the operation of real property, when such work is not funded in the university\u2019s operating budget.\n\n\nCapital renewal is defined according to Section 24-30-1301 (3) C.R.S.\n\t\nFor purposes on this policy, capital renewal means a controlled maintenance project of real property or integrated projects that exceed a cost of two million dollars in a fiscal year.\u00a0\n\n\nIV. \u00a0Related Policies, Procedures, Forms, Guidelines and Other Resources\nAttachments Directly Related to this Administrative Policy Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1 - Program Plans for University Funded Projects\nAppendix 2 - Selecting Architects and Engineers\nAppendix 3 - University of Colorado Design Review Board\nAppendix 4 - Facility Space Inventory\n\n\n\nOther Related Administrative Policy Statements\n\n\n\n\n\nAPS\u00a02005 - Contracting Authority\nAPS\u00a02006 - Retention of University Records\n\nSystem Schedule\nCU Boulder Schedule\nUCCS Schedule\nCU Denver Schedule\n\n\n\n\nOther Resources (i.e., training, secondary contact information)\n\n\n\n\n\nCCHE Capital Policies\nOffice of the State Architect\nProcurement Service Center\nOffice of University Controller\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency\n\n\n\nV. \u00a0History\n\n\nInitial policy - Developing, Requesting and Monitoring Capital Construction Projects \u2013 was approved 07\/01\/1981.\nRevised 07\/15\/1986.\nRevised effective 07\/01\/2010.\u00a0 Renamed Capital Construction Planning and Projects (Previously named Developing, Requesting and Monitoring Capital Construction Projects.)\u00a0 This action consolidated previous APS with APS 3001 Facilities Space Inventory and APS 3003 Procedures for Selecting Architects & Engineers for Planning, Design & Construction Projects.\nRevised effective 01\/01\/11.\u00a0 The policy was revised to reflect comments from the Design Review Board.\nRevised effective 04\/01\/12 to clarify the terms, and goals of the University Design Review Board.\nNon-substantive changes made on 09\/01\/2014 to Appendix 3.\nRevised effective April\/9\/2015 to reflect legislative changes made in HB 14-1387.\n\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Program Plans for University Funded Projects\n\nGuidelines to Developing Program Plans for Regent Approval\nOverall Observations\nFlexibility legislation enacted in 2009 removes the University of Colorado from much of the program planning requirements of the state system. It is therefore incumbent upon the proposer of a capital project to present sufficient information to the Board of Regents that allows the board members to make an informed decision about the merits of a proposed capital project. Each campus shall use good professional judgment when developing a project so as to ensure that the project is in conformance with the strategic plan and master plan of the campus on which the project resides.\nProgram Plan Format\nIn general, there is no required format for program plans beyond that which is described below. Each campus\u2019 facilities planning director shall develop processes and procedures that reflect their respective institution\u2019s method of developing consensus about a capital project. A project originator shall work with their facilities departments to ensure that these procedures are followed. Program plans that are requesting state capital construction funds must use the State of Colorado format.\nEach program plan should have the following information presented as appropriate for the scope and size of the project (see following Table 1 for project specific elements):\n\nAn Executive Summary, one page in length, that contains the basic information given in the rest of the document;\n\t\u00a0\nGoal and Objectives that will be accomplished by the implementation of this project;\n\t\u00a0\nFactual Data that supports or influences the decisions being made about the proposed facility;\n\t\u00a0\nFacilities Response including alternatives that were considered in developing the plan;\n\t\u00a0\nImplementation Information that describes the schedule, cost, funding sources, and operation costs; and,\n\t\u00a0\nAppendices that contain more in-depth information as required to fully describe the proposed project.\n\nImpact Upon Master Planning\nOccasionally proposed program plans may be, or appear to be, inconsistent with the currently-approved master plan. When such a situation occurs, be certain to include the appropriate changes to the campus master plan as a separate submission to the director of capital assets. The master plan update should indicate how the changes to the master plan are consistent with the institution\u2019s role and mission.\n\u00a0\nAppendix 2 \u2013 Procedures for Selecting Architects and Engineers for Planning, Design and Construction Projects\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following policies and procedures for the selection of consulting architects and engineers are based upon the statutory requirements and those expressed concerns of Article 30, Part 14, Title 24 of the Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS 24-30-1401-1408).\nSTATEMENT OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\nEach campus requiring the services of a consulting architect or engineer (A\/E) will determine as precisely as possible the scope of the work the A\/E will be expected to perform.\n\t\u00a0\nPublic notice will be given according to state statute (CRS 24-30-1405) except when using CRS 24-30-1407 to use an architect or engineer that has prior existing plans.\n\t\u00a0\nA committee comprised of a campus staff architect\/planner, project manager, user group representative and design review board member (if requested by the Campus Architect) will evaluate the expressions of interest to determine which three or more firms will be interviewed.\n\t\u00a0\nThese firms will then be invited in accordance with procedures outlined by the Office of the State Architect to participate in discussions with the committee.\n\t\u00a0\nPrior to discussions, all the firms who will participate in the discussions should be invited to tour the area of proposed work.\n\t\u00a0\nEach firm should be evaluated on the criteria outlined by the Office of the State Architect and the following general criteria:\n\t\nProject team\nFirm capabilities\nPrior experience\nProject approach\nSustainable design and understanding of problems and solutions\nFiscal responsibility\nCommitment to campus design guidelines\n\n\t\tBefore scheduled discussions begin, committee members should familiarize themselves with the scoring system and determine the appropriateness of the interview questions and set their relative value. The sample score sheets provided by the Office of the State Architect should be used as a guide and modified as appropriate to fit the specific project. There should be no questioning as to specific fees for the proposed project during these quality evaluation discussions; however, general questions about financial areas and\/or the firm's willingness and ability to meet budget requirements as shown on the attached sheet are appropriate.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nFollowing each interview, each committee member should complete the rating of all appropriate items on the score sheet. After all interviews have been completed, the committee should total all the scores to determine a prioritized list of three A\/Es. During discussions, it is essential that the established schedule, format and time limit be maintained so that each A\/E receives equal treatment.\n\t\u00a0\nBased upon the score sheet ranking, the three top firms should be submitted in rank order to the campus chancellor for approval to negotiate a fair and reasonable fee.\n\t\u00a0\nConsistent with 24-30-1407, a single architect or engineering firm can be presented to the Chancellor based on being able to reuse their existing drawings, specifications, designs, or other documents from a prior project.\n\t\u00a0\nUpon chancellor approval, negotiations for fair and reasonable compensation should begin and progress in the following manner:\n\t\nEstablish a negotiating team. \u00a0The negotiator can be a single individual or a group but at least one of the negotiators should be a committee member to provide continuity of thought.\nNegotiate with the most qualified firm for agreement on fair and reasonable compensation.\nIn the event that negotiations are unsuccessful, formally discontinue negotiations with the most qualified firm and begin negotiations with the second most qualified firm.\nIf these negotiations are also unsuccessful, formally discontinue negotiations and begin negotiations with the next most qualified firm on the list.\nShould these negotiations also fail, formally discontinue the negotiations. Renegotiations can then begin with any and all of the three most qualified A\/E firms and\/or the scope of their work can be reconsidered until satisfactory negotiations are achieved or all proposals rejected.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nScores for each firm interviewed will be made available to the Board of Regents upon request only.\n\nAppendix 3 - University of Colorado Design Review Board\n\n\nAuthority of the DRB\n\n\tThe Design Review Board (\u201cDRB\u201d) will have the authority and responsibility specified in the Charge to the Board below.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\n\u00a0Charge to the Design Review Board The charge to the Design Review Board consists of:\n\nReviewing and advising appropriate campus officials on the facilities portion of campus master plans and development of land use plans, with particular concern for aesthetic and physical characteristics of the individual campus.\n\t\t\u00a0\nReviewing and evaluating at the time of project design, proposals for new construction, major exterior renovations, and building additions, with particular concern for consistency with adopted campus design guidelines, including:\u200b\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nBasic planning\nArchitectural design including form, colors, materials, and texture\u00a0\nLandscape design and materials\nBuilding placement and massing\nArea and site planning\u00a0\n\n\n\nCampus aesthetics\u00a0\nConsistency of detailing\u00a0\nLand use criteria and policies\nCampus entryway signage and signage design guidelines \u00a0\nSustainable design\n\n\n\n \u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\n\nDRB\u00a0Review and Approval, and Appeal from\u00a0DRB\u00a0decisions\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDRB\u00a0Review and Approval\nThe\u00a0DRB\u00a0will formally approve or deny project design at each stage of the design review process (see procedures). All areas of disagreement with the\u00a0DRB\u00a0recommendations should be discussed and, to the extent possible, resolved with the University Architect.\nAppeal Process\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a campus disagrees with a formal\u00a0DRB\u00a0action, the campus may appeal that decision to the president through the Vice President of Budget and Finance or his\/her designee.\n\nPrior to a formal appeal, a chancellor may choose to bring the matter to the attention of the Vice President of Budget and Finance or the President.\nWithin 30 days of a DRB decision that a campus wishes to appeal, the campus architect, through the appropriate Vice Chancellor, shall advise the Vice President of Budget and Finance or his\/her designee on design directions that vary from the DRB\u2019s recommendations.\nBefore resolving such an appeal, the president shall consult with the campus chancellor.\nThe president\u2019s decision on a campus\u2019s appeal from a\u00a0DRB\u00a0decision shall be final.\n\n\n\n\nConducting periodic reviews\u00a0of the campus facilities and environs. These reviews may be performed by a combination of campus presentations and walking tours. As a result, every attempt will be made to meet on each campus throughout the year. It is requested that the campus chancellor accompany the Design Review Board on the campus tours.\n\t\t\u00a0\nMembers of the DRB\u00a0will be sensitive to the complicated nature of providing architectural services and will seek appropriate ways to work with project architects in expediting reviews and design input early in the process.\n\t\t\u00a0\nA member of the DRB\u00a0may, at the discretion of the Campus Architect, serve on each campus consulting architect selection committee if the project warrants DRB review. \u00a0The DRB member or campus will report back to the DRB at the next regular meeting the outcomes of the selection process.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe Vice President for Budget and Finance or his\/her designee (exofficio member) will work with the campuses in providing early identification of projects (scope, program planning goals) to the DRB.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\nComposition of the Design Review Board\n\n\tThe president shall appoint the members of the DRB, which membership shall be comprised of:\n\t\nTwo highly regarded architects;\nOne highly regarded landscape architect;\nOne architect or engineer with expertise in sustainable building design;\nOne senior administrator or faculty from the College of Architecture & Planning (who may fill the expertise listed above);\nThe Vice President for Budget and Finance or his\/her designee (ex officio); and\nA campus staff member designated by the campus for its respective campus projects.\n\n\t\tThe President will appoint members for a five-year term1.\u00a0 Member services will be procured by annual renewable one-year contracts. \u00a0The president may re-appoint members for an additional term, provided that a member does not serve more than ten consecutive years, if the president determines that a member has demonstrated specialized expertise, represents the specialized need of a campus, or offers other unique services. Appointments shall be staggered so that member(s) rotate off every year except in the case where a term is renewed.\n\nCandidates for membership shall be solicited, when appropriate, from university design professionals, from the Colorado\u00a0AIA\u00a0(The American Institute of Architects), the Colorado\u00a0ASLA\u00a0(The American Society of Landscape Architects), and from present Design Review Board members.\n\n\t\tThe current membership shall be posted on the university system website. Former members may be granted emeritus status by the president. Emeritus members may, at the request of the university, fill in for current members when they cannot fulfill their obligations, or perform special projects. Emeritus status may be rescinded at any time by the president.\n\nAdministration of the\u00a0DRB\n\n\tThe\u00a0DRB\u00a0will be administered by the Office of the Vice President of Budget and Finance. The budget for the Design Review Board will be reviewed annually and will be set by the president after consultation with the vice president and chief financial officer. The budget review will include both the general system administration account and provision for special charges.\n\t\u00a0\nContractual relationship between DRB members and the university\n\n\tThe university shall procure DRB member services through annual contracts. In addition to delineating the scope of work, DRB member\u2019s contracts shall address the following issues:\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nConflict of Interest - The conflict of interest statutes, laws, policies and procedures of the State of Colorado, the Regents of the University of Colorado, and the University of Colorado apply to the Design Review Board. Any member of the Design Review Board desiring to compete for a university capital project on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any firm, corporation, partnership, or any other entity of which he or she is a member, partner, shareholder, or any other type of owner must recuse himself or herself \u00a0from discussions and decisions regarding that project prior to serving on an architect selection committee or submitting, or accepting a proposal for consulting services, and the DRB member shall not attempt to influence the decisions of other DRB members. If a DRB member or any firm, corporation, partnership, or any other entity of which he or she is a member, partner, shareholder, or any other type of owner has a direct personal or private interest in any matter pending before the DRB, the member shall disclose such interest to the Vice President for Budget and Finance or his\/her designee and the DRB and shall not vote on the matter and shall not attempt to influence the decisions of other Board members. If the DRB member is not awarded the contract, the member becomes eligible once again for full board participation.\u00a0\n\n\t\t\u00a0\nProfessional Fees - Members of the Design Review Board are eligible for reimbursement of personal expenses and modest compensation directly related to Design Review Board activities, pursuant to their contract with the university and to applicable university policies and State statutes. Reimbursement will be at current rates and practices as established by the Regents and\/or the State of Colorado.\u00a0 Campus staff representative members will not receive additional compensation.\n\n\nAppendix 4 \u2013 Facility Space Inventory\n\nThese measurements are necessary to ensure the best use and most efficient utilization of space. Proper measurement and classification of space usage also furthers compliance reporting to state and federal agencies.\nProcess:\n\nEach campus must develop and maintain a program of space management that is responsible for overseeing space and space usage for their respective campus properties and properties related to the campus. The university controller and the Vice President for Budget and Finance or his\/her designee will assist the offices as necessary to ensure space facilities inventory systems are coordinated and standardized as necessary.\nEach chancellor may designate a space management coordinator for the campus. The responsibility for the proper operation of the program may be delegated to such a coordinator. The coordinator will seek such advice and assistance as deemed necessary to develop the policy and procedures for the campus.\u00a0 The coordinator is responsible for developing an effective space plan to ensure space needs are met.\nThere shall be a master list of the buildings for each campus and an inventory of gross space for each building shall be made of record and reported to the Office of the State Architect per current state policies. An inventory of separate rooms, their space and classification, shall be made of record and the total of such room inventory shall be kept in balance with the building space recorded.\n\n\nThe campus coordinator should be delegated the power by the chancellor to obtain, through the several organizations on the campus, the assigned and assignable space.\u00a0 A physical check of the actual space, and a comparison of the results of this check to the inventory records, shall be made on a routine basis resulting in the entire inventory being completely checked within a three-year period of time. This procedure may be undertaken on a continuous cycle or on a periodic basis.\nThe campus coordinator shall work with the campus registrar and institutional research departments to report on the utilization of classroom and academic laboratory space consistent with Department of Higher Education guidelines.\u00a0\n\n1. Appointment term changed from four to five years, effective September 1, 2014, at the recommendation of the President and due to the number of members increasing.\u00a0\u00a0 The new appointment term will better accommodate the rotation of members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy outlines procedures applicable to all campuses for the development, implementation, and management of the university\u2019s long-range capital plan and annual capital budget.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This policy statement is designed to be responsive to the operating, regulatory, and statutory changes which have evolved since\u00a0July 15, 1986, including recent changes in the 2014 legislative session.\u00a0 In addition, during the 2009 and 2010 legislative sessions, new and\/or modified statutory authority was given to the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, the governing boards of the colleges and universities in Colorado, and the Office of the State Architect.\u00a0\u200b"},{"university":"cu","name":"2003","policy":"\n\nAPS 2003 -

Wilkerson, Vice President, University Counsel and Secretary of the Board of RegentsResponsible University Officer:\u00a0Daniel J. Wilkerson, Vice President, University Counsel and Secretary of the Board of RegentsResponsible Office:\u00a0Technology Transfer OfficePolicy Contact:\u00a0David N. Allen, Associate Vice President for Technology TransferSupersedes:\u00a0March 2, 2003Last Reviewed\/Updated date:\u00a0February 1, 2011Applies to:\u00a0All campuses\n\n\n\nIn this policy the University of Colorado reaffirms its commitment to academic freedom. The University of Colorado also encourages and rewards its discoverers and innovators who benefit society and who create significant economic resources for themselves, their research programs and the University.\u00a0\nThis policy shall be interpreted to be consistent with other University of Colorado policies, and federal and state statutes and regulations.\nII. \u00a0Policy Statement\n\nThis policy shall be applicable to all units of the University and all included persons as that term is described below.\u00a0 EmployeesEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly. of the University are bound by this policy including those receiving salaries, scholarships, fellowships or other remuneration from the University, part-time employees, student employees, University employees on sabbatical who receive remuneration from the University, and employees on a leave of absence who partake in substantial use of University resources. Adjunct and adjoint appointees and visitors who are collaborators with included persons and partake in substantial use of University Resources are also bound by this policy.\nThis policy does not change the traditional relationship between the University and employees who are creators or authors of scholarly and artistic works. Ownership and copyrights in scholarly and artistic works including but not limited to textbooks, electronic media, syllabi, tests, assignments, monographs, papers, models, musical compositions, works of art and unpublished manuscripts are governed by the Administrative Policy Statement (APS), \"Intellectual Property that is Educational Materials.\"\nA. \u00a0University Ownership.\n\nAs required by Regent Policy, the University shall take assignment of and shall own all discoveries in which University has an interest.\u00a0 Every included person(s), as a condition of employment, and every collaborator participating with an included person on a discovery, will assign and hereby does assign any legal rights that may exist in such intellectual property. \u00a0The University shall have no ownership rights in the following intellectual property, which shall be owned by its creator:\n\t\n\n\nIntellectual property that is Educational Materials and owned by the creator as determined pursuant to the Administrative Policy Statement Intellectual Property that is Educational Materials; or\u00a0\nIntellectual property created by a student solely for the purpose of satisfying course requirements, unless the student A) creates the intellectual property with an included person, B) assigns ownership rights in the intellectual property to the University in writing or C) must make an assignment of such ownership rights to the University as a condition for participation in a course.\n\n\t\t\tProvided, however, that if the intellectual property referred to in (a) or (b) is a derivative of or otherwise uses pre-existing University-owned intellectual property, this provision shall not prevent the University from asserting its pre-existing rights.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nAs provided in A.1., the University shall take assignment and shall own \u201cdiscoveries in which the University has an interest\u2019 that are created during the course of sponsored research, consulting, or other contractual arrangements. Only the Principal Technology Officer has the legal, delegated authority to assign ownership, license, or otherwise provide legal rights to discoveries and University intellectual property.\n\nB. \u00a0Responsibilities of Discoverers\n\nDiscovery Disclosure. \u00a0Involvement of discoverers in all aspects of the intellectual property protection and commercialization process is essential for successful technology transfer. Discoverers are responsible for preparing a timely written disclosure of discoveries using the University's standard discovery disclosure forms. Discoverers will cooperate with the Technology Transfer Office and take all reasonable steps to fully complete discovery disclosure forms, provide complete description of the discovery, and to execute assignments and other documents necessary for the protection of a discovery or other documents conveying rights to University intellectual property. Discoverers will also cooperate with the Technology Transfer Office in matters such as sharing contacts and leads for potential licensees, communicating or meeting with potential licensees, providing samples and information to potential licensees (when reasonably available), and other activities as reasonably requested by the Technology Transfer Office in support of efforts to secure, market and transfer University intellectual property.\n\t\u00a0\nSponsored Programs, Corporate and Third Party Obligations. \u00a0Discoverers should provide to the Technology Transfer Office timely prior written notice of any proposed publication or Sponsored Program requirement that reports or describes any discoveries. Discoverers shall inform all University and external collaborators of the terms and conditions of this policy and of any contractual agreements that might substantially affect rights to discoveries created by those collaborators. The Technology Transfer Office will assist discoverers in assessing whether or not a presentation or publication impacts patentability and in explaining this policy to collaborators.\n\t\u00a0\nOther Reporting Requirements. \u00a0It is the responsibility of a discoverer to provide the Technology Transfer Office with current contact information and to provide the address to which the discoverer's apportionment of net receipts should be sent. It is also the responsibility of the discoverer to work with the Technology Transfer Office to create a University account for his or her research program apportionment of net receipts.\n\nC. \u00a0Responsibilities of the University\n\nThe Associate Vice President for Technology Transfer has the primary responsibility for the implementation of this policy on behalf of the University. Only University Officials who have specific delegated authority may undertake actions in the name of the University to execute this policy. The Principal Technology Transfer Officer will:\n\n\n\nsupervise the management of each case pursued by the Technology Transfer Office including complete record keeping and required reporting of all actions;\ndetermine whether the University or any other party has rights to discoveries according to this policy, and if so, the basis and extent of such rights. In the absence of agreement on inventorship, the Technology Transfer Office will work with counsel to determine the actual inventors under United States Patent Law;\nassess what steps should be taken with respect to the protection and commercialization of discoveries including patentability, licensing or use in the public domain. These decisions should consider the wishes of the discoverer whenever reasonably feasible, should be informed by commercially reasonable standards, should consider all relevant legally binding agreements and should be in the best interest of the University;\nsupervise the processes of the Technology Transfer Office for obtaining legal protection and\/or arranging for licensing or other commercial development in those cases in which the University elects to pursue its rights, including preparing and prosecuting applications for patent, copyright registration, and other legal protection, or obtaining counsel or other assistance for that purpose, negotiating or assisting in negotiation of licenses and related agreements, and monitoring the collection and distribution of net receipts; and\nreview and negotiate sponsored research agreement terms which implicate discoveries and existing or future University intellectual property and in particular supervise compliance with government regulations concerning discoveries developed with government support. The Principal Technology Transfer Officer shall sign any sponsored research agreement which obligates to third parties existing or future University intellectual property.\n\n\nThe procedure for administration of discovery disclosures by the Technology Transfer Office will be as follows:\n\nUpon receipt of a discovery disclosure, the Technology Transfer Office will make all reasonable efforts to work with the discoverer to promptly evaluate the discovery disclosure for patentability, technical feasibility and commercial potential and may undertake any of the following actions: 1) request additional information and data from the discoverer to complete the discovery disclosure as necessary to file a patent application; 2) proceed to file a patent application on the discovery; 3) market the University intellectual property to potential licensees prior to patent filing; or 4) formally decide not to proceed with protecting and\/or marketing the University intellectual property. In making this determination, the Technology Transfer Office shall take into account licensing mechanisms for further academic research, open source licensing in the case of software, and the general missions of the University in the creation and dissemination of knowledge for the public good.\nIn all cases, based on reasonable cooperation by the discoverer, the Technology Transfer Office shall endeavor to make a preliminary decision on protecting the University discovery within four (4) months of receipt of a complete discovery disclosure.\nImpending publication or other unique circumstances may motivate a decision sooner than the four-month period. Should the Technology Transfer Office decide not to protect or market the discovery, the Technology Transfer Office will ask the discoverer in writing if he or she desires that the University release all or a subset of its rights in the discovery to the discoverer, as allowed by law and Section H of this policy, subject to rights of sponsors and the right of the University to practice the discovery for academic use.\nOnly designated officials have the delegated authority to bind the University in an agreement involving University discoveries and University intellectual property. Should a University employee not possessing such delegated authority sign an assignment of intellectual property rights or an agreement seeking to bind the University, such an agreement will be null and void.\nD. \u00a0Committee on University Discoveries\nThe Committee on University Discoveries (\"Committee\") shall be composed of nine members. The Associate Vice President for Technology Transfer shall select the members in consultation with and concurrence by the Campus Chancellors who shall consult with the chair from the respective Faculty Councils. All members will serve staggered three-year terms. Each year the Committee will elect its Chair, who will serve for the following one year. Committee members may serve no more than one term of three consecutive years after which time they will be ineligible for service for one year. Members of the Committee will not participate as members in deliberations or actions of the Committee concerning matters in which they have a beneficial interest. Official actions of the Committee will require the concurrence of at least five (5) members. The Principal Technology Transfer Officer will be a permanent ex-officio member of the Committee.\nE. \u00a0Committee Responsibilities\n\nThe Committee will:\n\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\nreview Regent policy, \"Intellectual Property on Discoveries and Patents for Their Protection and Commercialization,\" at least every three years;\nreview and advise the Principal Technology Transfer Officer on the standards and procedures contained in this policy;\nconvene at least once per year to review the procedures used in implementing and administering this policy, and where deemed necessary, develop and recommend changes in standards and procedures to the Principal Technology Transfer Officer; and\nserve as a board to which discoverers may appeal actions of University officers responsible for executing this policy, subject to appropriate review standards and procedures set forth in this policy.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nDiscoverer Appeal Process\n\n\tDiscoverers or other included persons may appeal to the Committee actions of University officers responsible for executing this policy. Grounds for such appeal are alleged failure of University officers to comply with the provisions of this policy, to substantially follow implementing guidelines, or to demonstrate reasonable diligence in decision-making.\n\n\tA discoverer or other included person will submit the appeal in writing to the Committee Chair who will determine whether the petitioner has made reasonable efforts to resolve the complaint with the University officer and whether the substance of the appeal appears to be within the scope of this policy. The Committee Chair shall schedule the meeting. At least five Committee members must be in attendance. Proceedings will be informal and held in confidence. All parties will have adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. After considering all relevant information, the Committee Chair will send to the University Vice President a written report of the Committee's findings, which will include a decision on the issues raised by the petitioner and any recommended corrective action. The University Vice President will review the report and may adopt it in whole or in part and\/or modify it on behalf of the University. The decision of the University Vice President shall be final.\n\nF. \u00a0Procedures for Receiving and Distributing Tangible Research Property\nUniversity researchers shall disclose and discuss the terms of transfer of research materials with a campus Sponsored Program Office or the Technology Transfer Office before accepting or distributing tangible research property. University researchers are also responsible for complying with campus policies and procedures on the handling of tangible research property.\n\nReceiving tangible research property\n\t\n\n\nAn agreement specifying the rights and obligations in tangible research property shall be executed by the external (institutional or commercial) parties involved in the transfer. Tangible research property agreements shall be negotiated by Technology Transfer Office, as may be applicable.\nThe delegated authority for signing an incoming tangible research property transfer agreement is within the Technology Transfer Office. Researchers receiving tangible research property shall sign the tangible research property agreement acknowledging the terms of the agreement.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nDistributing tangible research property\n\t\n\n\nThe delegated authority for signing non-exclusive transfer agreements providing for the distribution of tangible research property to organizations for non-commercial research and\/or commercial use research is within the Technology Transfer Office.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nCosts associated with the transfer of tangible research property\n\t\n\n\nTangible research property transfer agreements may provide for recovery of costs of the tangible research property to be delivered. As a general rule, ten thousand dollars ($10,000) is the upper limit allowable for recovery of tangible research property costs. Recoverable costs are those direct costs necessary to prepare and ship the materials. According to this general rule, an agreement providing for the transfer of tangible research property involving remuneration in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) will be treated as a license agreement and the remuneration will be considered as royalty and subject to net receipts distributions.\n\n\n\nG. \u00a0Consulting and Business Activity Related to the Transfer of Discoveries\nConsulting activities have the potential to result in the loss or diminishment of University\u2019s intellectual property rights. Included persons engaging in consulting or in business activity, and those with delegated authority to approve such activities on behalf of the University, are responsible for ensuring that any agreements with external entities are not in conflict with this policy. The Technology Transfer Office will provide assistance to discoverers and those charged with approving consulting or business activity on interpreting and suggesting language in consulting and business related agreements concerning intellectual property rights subject to this policy.\u00a0 In some cases, the University manages consulting activities through affiliated entities (e.g., University Physicians, Inc.).\u00a0 Included persons are responsible for determining which entity manages its consulting activities.\u00a0\nPrior to engaging in consulting or business activity related to intellectual property, included persons are responsible for making their University intellectual property obligations clear to those external entities. The Technology Transfer Office will assist included persons and University officials reviewing consulting and related legal agreements to understand and appropriately revise, if need be, the intellectual property clauses of such agreements. In some cases it may be prudent for the included person to engage outside legal counsel to provide advice on such agreements concerning matters outside the scope of this policy.\nUniversity intellectual property rights and the obligations of included persons to the University shall not be diminished by the terms of included persons' consulting or business activity agreements with third parties, except as the Principal Technology Transfer Officer may specifically authorize in writing. As a general rule, consulting work that is evaluative or advisory, such as when expert opinion and scientific review are offered, is unlikely to constitute discoveries in which the University has an interest. Conversely, consulting work that is related to an included person\u2019s activities or field of expertise at the University, as articulated in a faculty member\u2019s professional plan or an employee\u2019s position description, and that has the potential for the creation of discoveries in which the University has an interest requires that procedures related to discovery disclosure in this policy be followed. Requests for authorization to remove or limit the University's rights or included persons' obligations in consulting or business activity agreements are to be submitted to the Principal Technology Transfer Officer who, upon a request by the included person, will consult with the individual\u2019s unit supervisor, University Vice President, and other relevant University officers.\nH. \u00a0Transfer of Rights to Discoverers\nIf the University decides not to pursue a discovery in which the University has an interest, then the discoverer has the right to pursue commercialization of the discovery, subject to any rights of other parties. If the Technology Transfer Office does not exercise its rights to University intellectual property through:\n\nsecuring or maintaining legal protection as described in Section C of this policy, or\nlicensure of rights to another party or dedication of its rights to the public, or\nif the University chooses to protect intellectual property, but does not arrange for its commercial development or dedication to the public within a reasonable time, then, the Technology Transfer Office will inquire in writing to the discoverer if he or she desires the University to release its rights in the discovery to the discoverer.\n\nUpon receipt of a written affirmation by the discoverer (or in the case of multiple discoverers, a written affirmation by all discoverers), the Principal Technology Transfer Officer will release to the discoverer(s) the University's rights provided the University will retain a royalty-free license to use the discovery for research, educational, and service purposes for the legal life of the discovery. Such release will also be contingent upon the approval by the company or agency that funded research from which the discovery was derived. The Technology Transfer Office will cooperate in obtaining the approval from the company or agency that funded research.\nI. \u00a0Distribution of Net Receipts\nIn the event that a discoverer or anyone from the group of discoverers is no longer an employee of the University, that discoverer's personal share of net receipts will continue. Upon the death of a discoverer, his or her personal share of net receipts will be directed to his\/her heirs or estate.\nThe Technology Transfer Office agrees to share and distribute net receipts received from the commercialization of any discovery developed under the terms of an agreement as follows: 25 percent to discoverer(s) personally; 25 percent to a University campus account for support of discoverer's(s') research; 25 percent to an account for the benefit of the University; and 25 percent to the Campus Chancellor, which will be directed to research with technology transfer potential and distributed on a percentage basis as determined at each individual campus. The Campus Chancellors' Offices will make information regarding this distribution readily available. In the event that all discoverers related to a particular discovery, including emeriti with active research accounts as determined by the departmental chair, are no longer employed by the University, the 25 percent designated to such research account shall be divided 10% to an account for the benefit of the University and 15% to the Campus Chancellor, which will be distributed in a manner identical to the Campus Chancellor share mentioned above. Any disputes that are unable to be resolved through discussions of the Principal Technology Transfer Officer and interested parties related to the distribution of research accounts shall be presented to and adjudicated by the Committee on University Discoveries. Inventors who have left University employment and thereby have forfeited their 25 percent for support of discoverers' research, will be eligible to reinstate this support upon being re-employed by the University.\nNet receipts amounts allocated to discoverers will be divided equally among them. However, individual discoverers may enter into agreements to reallocate such amounts either among themselves or others who contributed to the research upon which the University intellectual property is based. Participants in any apportionment also have the option of assigning their personal share to any account managed by the University. Such agreements must be in writing, signed by all of those affected and submitted to the Principal Technology Transfer Officer. In order for discoverers who desire to assign their personal share of net receipts to an account managed by the University to have no negative tax consequence, the assignment must occur before the first royalty or related payment is received by the University from the licensee. If the University does not have the discoverer's address, any net receipts amount allocated to an individual that cannot be distributed within a reasonable time will be transferred to a reserve account managed under the rules of the University's escheat property accounting policy.\nWhen in the judgment of the Principal Technology Transfer Officer a reasonable basis exists for believing that net receipts subject to allocation and distribution under this policy may be required to be changed or otherwise expended, or that others may have a claim to such amounts, the allocation and distribution may be delayed for a reasonable period required for resolution of the matter. Payments made in good faith prior to such a resolution by the University to one or more claimants will fully satisfy any obligations on the part of the University to all claimants for the amounts so paid. Awards, prizes, honoraria, and the like received by individuals primarily as recognition for invention achievement are not considered as net receipts.\nJ. \u00a0Special Circumstances Concerning Scope of this Policy\nThe University shall have no ownership rights in discoveries created by a student solely for the purpose of satisfying course requirements, unless the student creates the discovery with an included person, or assigns ownership rights in the discovery to the University in writing or unless assignment of such ownership rights to the University is made a condition for participation in a course. The University will make no ownership claim on discoveries created by a student who is not employed by the University or has not used substantial University resources to develop intellectual property, unless the student's work is part of a discovery in which the University has an interest and is University intellectual property. If the student-created discovery is a discovery in which the University has an interest and is University intellectual property, the student will be bound by this policy, including but not limited to, rights in the distribution of net receipts. A student who holds an award such as scholarship or fellowship through the University and who creates a discovery developed during the course of the award will be bound by this policy. The lab share of any student covered by this policy shall be directed to such student's supervisor's lab account and such funds should be directed to the student inventor for the duration of the student's involvement at CU. The University will make no ownership claim on discoveries created by an included person who has not used substantial University resources to develop a discovery and who has created a discovery which is not related to his or her research activities or field of expertise as articulated in a faculty member\u2019s professional plan or an employee\u2019s position description. However, the University may exercise its rights if the employee's work is part of a discovery in which the University has an interest such as a new use or improvement of existing University intellectual property.\nK. \u00a0Special Circumstances Related to the Grant of a License to a Start-Up Company\nThe University encourages the start-up of companies based upon technology transfer of University intellectual property provided that conflicts of interest and commitment are addressed and if necessary managed. The University may license University intellectual property to companies in which included persons have a financial interest provided that conflict of interest and conflict of commitment concerns have been adequately addressed in a conflict of interest management agreement between those included persons and the University. Similarly, companies in which included persons hold a financial interest may sponsor research and if duly qualified, that included person may be an investigator, subject to an approved conflict of interest management agreement. The responsibility for preparing and enforcing the conflict of interest management agreement resides in the University employee's administrative chain of supervision or in other designated University committees, e.g., Campus conflict of interest committees and\/or campus research compliance officer.\u00a0 Such committees or officers may request assistance from the Technology Transfer Office, the Office of University Counsel and other relevant University officers in preparing the conflict of interest management agreement.\nThe Technology Transfer Office, in consultation with the discoverer, will make a determination as to whether University intellectual property has the potential to be licensed as the basis of a new company. Three primary criteria for any start-up company to license University intellectual property are: 1) a business plan that sufficiently identifies the resources and steps necessary to commercialize the University intellectual property, 2) a commitment of sufficient initial capital and a reasonable chance to obtain additional capital necessary to commercialize the University intellectual property, and 3) a sufficiently experienced and available management team capable of raising capital and executing the business plan. If the company does not meet these criteria, the company may receive either a time-limited exclusive option to the University intellectual property during which period the company should work to assemble the resources and information necessary to meet these three requirements or an exclusive license conditional on at least these three criteria. Decisions about whether or not a potential licensee meets the three primary requirements for a license will be made by the Principal Technology Transfer Officer. The Principal Technology Transfer Officer may seek input on this decision from the Technology Transfer Office business advisory board as may be reasonably appropriate. Equity received as consideration for a license, by either the University or an organization designated by the University to hold such equity, will be distributed as soon as it is feasible to do so, except in special circumstances as determined by the University or by the University designee.\u00a0 Equity received as consideration for a license to University intellectual property will be treated as net receipts upon liquidation. \u00a0\nL. \u00a0Special Circumstances Related to Software\nIn order to determine whether or not software is within the scope of this policy, included persons will disclose all software intended for use outside of the University to the Technology Transfer Office. The Technology Transfer Office will provide a separate software discovery disclosure form. Software generally is covered by copyright protection; however, some software is patentable. To the extent the software is a part of a textbook or other education program, any non-patent eligible content contained in the program shall not be considered discoveries under this policy. Such content may be covered by the policy on Intellectual Property that is Educational Materials and the Technology Transfer Office may notify the appropriate parties of such possible coverage. If the software is determined by the Technology Transfer Office to be patentable, it will be handled as patentable intellectual property under the scope of this policy. If the disclosed software is determined by the Technology Transfer Office as not patentable, the Technology Transfer Office may either: 1) legally secure the software through copyright and market it to potential licensees, 2) distribute the software through open source licensing, or 3) assign University intellectual property in the software to the discoverer under the terms of this policy. If the open source licensing is chosen, the discoverer will work with the Technology Transfer Office to ensure that no other parties claim rights to the software, no conflicts of interest would result from the open source license, and the appropriate type of open source license and disclaimer is being utilized in the software distribution. The Technology Transfer Office will use its commercially reasonable efforts to determine these issues and recommend a course of action for disposition of software to the discoverer in a timely manner.\nIII. \u00a0Definitions\n\nThe terms defined in Section 3 of Regent policy, \"Intellectual Property Policy on Discoveries and Patents for their Protection and Commercialization,\" apply to this Administrative Policy Statement.

Representatives from the Colorado Commission of Higher Education and governing boards of higher education institutions in Colorado administer the Student Employee Retirement Plan to ensure it meets minimum federal standards to qualify as a retirement plan.\n\nAt its meeting of April 15, 1993, the Board of Regents approved the Student Employee Retirement Plan for student employees who are not exempt from participation in a retirement plan. Regental policy11.F.2 forms the basis for this administrative policy statement and for the conditions of participation in the Student Retirement Plan. The policy states: \u201cEligible Employees shall be enrolled in a retirement program as provided by applicable state plan or as authorized by the Board of Regents.\u201d\nThis administrative policy statement addresses social security tax and related withholding issues associated with employees in student job classifications. Specifically, it explains which employees are eligible for the student FICA exception and thus are not subject to the Student Employee Retirement PlanStudent Retirement PlanSee Section IV. Definitions and Medicare tax withholding.\nEmployees at the University who qualify as students under IRS guidelines are generally exempt from mandatory alternate retirement plan withholding (i.e., the Student Employee Retirement Plan) and Medicare tax withholding. Student employees who work for the University of Colorado may qualify as students under IRS guidelines - and exemption from the Student Employee Retirement Plan - on the basis of their employment at the University of Colorado. However, student employees who are enrolled in high school, trade school, or any schools other than the University of Colorado, are subject to the Student Employee Retirement Plan.\nThe Chancellors are responsible for implementing and enforcing this policy on their campuses. \u00a0The campuses are responsible for monitoring employees in student job classifications on the student payroll for compliance with IRS and University guidelines. All employees in student job classifications on the student payroll must be evaluated at the end of the \"add\/drop\" period for each academic term to verify student status during that term. Documentation of the student status evaluation will reside in the hiring department.\nII.

Determination of student status will be made each pay period using the information sent to Employee Services by the campuses.\u00a0 The campuses shall begin to send to Employee Services information for the upcoming semester after the last semester ends.

However, these students must be enrolled in the Student Employee Retirement Plan if either of the following conditions exists:\n\t\t\nNew students with intentions of pursuing a course of study with the institution at the next available scheduled opportunity may pursue employment with the University one academic term prior to enrollment. The student must provide the hiring authority with proof of acceptance by the institution to enroll or have an enrollment confirmation for the next academic term.\nContinuing students following prescribed institution schedules for their pursuit of study may seek or continue employment with the University for one academic term. For example, this condition is intended to address those students not enrolled or attending the summer semester but who will continue their study in the fall semester.\n\nUpon graduation or receipt of a professional license or certification, the status of student, as defined, is terminated as of the end of that semester\/quarter academic term. Further employment by the hiring authority must be accomplished through regular University employee classifications and hiring procedures.\n\nEducational Resources\n\n\tAnnounced on the Employee Services website and in other campus outreach activities.\n\nIV.

An Organizational Unit may be a department or any other distinct operational activity with the following characteristics: \u2022 Organizational permanency; \u2022 Programmatic autonomy; and \u2022 An annual operating budget that is fiscally independent. Within the Finance System, these areas are represented on the ChartField tree as Orgs. may designate unit resources for the payment of license fees or certification fees when all three of the following conditions are met:\n\nThe license or certification is required for University employment. \u201cRequired for University employment\u201d means that the license or certification is indicated as a mandatory criterion for employment, not as a preferred criterion or an absent one.\nThere must be an equitable provision of the licenses or certifications throughout the department.\nThere is a reasonable expectation that the license or certification will be used solely for the purpose of providing services to the University, and not for providing services to others for a fee or other compensation. Organizational units should inform employees that if a license or certification paid for by University funds is used for anything other than University business, then the additional compensation generated by the license or the certification, or the value of the license or certification fee (whichever is less), must be reimbursed to the University.\n\nProhibitions\nUniversity funds may not be used for a license or certification that does not benefit the University and is solely for the professional development or advancement of an employee. Benefit to the University is measured through the receipt of support or information, as a result of having the license or certification, which is necessary to accomplish or foster the educational, research, or public service mission of the University.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memberships or Dues\nThe University may establish membership in organizations that promote the advancement of education and research, enhance the knowledge or tools required by employees to carry out their assigned responsibilities, and\/or facilitate favorable community-campus relationships.\nEvaluation Criteria\nWhen establishing a membership in an organization, the following criteria must be observed:\n\nA membership can be obtained only after careful evaluation of the costs of the membership in relation to the tangible and demonstrable benefits afforded to the University as a result of the membership. When evaluating a membership request, the organizational unit must be sensitive to the availability of funds, the relevance of the membership to the role and mission of the organizational unit, and the importance of the membership with respect to the discipline.\n\n\tIn general, memberships should offer benefits directly relevant to individual job duties and\/or organizational unit focus and mission, such as:\n\t\n\n\nProviding scholarly journals, professional publications, and employment information;\nOffering contact and information exchange with other professionals in the area of interest;\nAffording instructional enhancement;\nSupporting scholarly research and creative work; and\nImproving community-campus relations critical to the University\u2019s mission.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMemberships should be cost effective. That is:\n\t\n\n\nEach membership should provide its associated benefits at the least expense to the University.\nEmphasis should focus on securing\u00a0limited\u00a0numbers of quality memberships rather than having a broad coverage of potential memberships.\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nWhere possible, a general, rather than an individual, membership should be obtained, because a general membership often allows participation by several or alternative members.\nThe number of memberships acquired shall be restricted to the minimum number required to meet the needs of the organizational unit.\n\nMemberships and their related evaluation requirements are further segregated as follows:\n\nUniversity-wide Memberships:\u00a0 This type of membership is one that reflects University-wide interests and that would normally be held in the name of the University or the campus (not in the name of an individual) . A University-wide membership must be approved by the Vice President or Vice Chancellor of Finance or his\/her delegate to reduce the likelihood of redundant expenditures.\nSpecific Interest Memberships:\u00a0 Memberships and fee payments associated with a specific interest membership are of primary concern to specific organizational units of a campus. When examining a request for a specific interest membership, the approver should ensure that the principles and criteria described within this Administrative Policy Statement have been met.\n\nProhibitions\nNo payment is authorized for memberships in organizations that are primarily social, i.e., where the membership benefits the relationships of the employees, associates, and affiliates without making a direct contribution to the advancement of the University\u2019s mission.\nAs an affirmative action\/equal opportunity employer, the University prohibits the expenditure of its funds for membership in organizations that discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, color, national origin, or individual handicap.\nPolitical Action Committees\nIn some instances, societies, associations, or similar organizations may establish separate Political Action Committees, commonly referred to as PACs, to attempt to influence legislation of interest to the organizations. As part of the membership or dues application, a voluntary contribution to the PAC is frequently requested. Under no circumstances will University funds be used for a voluntary contribution to a PAC.\nWhen a separate PAC does not exist, organizations are required to estimateEstimatesFiscal transactions where the value assigned is based upon an assumption or educated guess as opposed to a fact or known event, e.g., estimate of amount owed for services as invoice has not yet been received. the amount of each base membership that is used for lobbying expenses. The estimate frequently is printed on the bottom of the invoice for membership dues. As long as the portion of the base membership related to lobbying expenses is not voluntary (i.e., the University must pay the full base membership to be a member) then it is permissible to use University funds to pay for the full base membership. If the portion of the base membership related to lobbying expenses is voluntary, then only the portion of the membership related to non-lobbying expenses can be paid with University funds.\nDonations\nIn some cases, a portion of the dues or membership fees may be the equivalent of a donation to the organization. If the donation portion is voluntary, then the donation portion must be excluded from the dues or membership fee paid with University funds, unless the specific donation has been approved in accordance with the Administrative Policy Statement Donations.\nIII. \u00a0Procedures, Forms, Guidelines and Resources\n\n\nRelated Administrative Policy Statements (APS) and Other Policies\n\nAdministrative Policy Statement 4015, Propriety of Expenses\nAdministrative Policy Statement 4027, Donations\n\nRelated Procedures\n\nAll expenditures of University funds must adhere to the requirements found in Procurement Service Center (PSC) procedures\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nEducational resources including guides, training notifications, and newsletters are announced and available on the PSC website.\n\n\nIV. \u00a0Definitions\n\nItalicized terms used in this Administrative Policy Statement are defined in the Policy Glossary\nV. \u00a0History\n\nSupersedes: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdministrative Policy Statement License and Certification Fees, Memberships, or Dues dated June 1, 2006\nAccounting Directive No. 95-2 \u201cGuidance on Political Expenses, Donations, and memberships\u201d dated November 30, 1995\nAdministrative Policy Statement \u201cAssociation Dues\u201d dated February 1, 1990\n\n\nVI. \u00a0Key Words\n\nLicense, certification, fees, memberships, dues, University funds\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\ncertification \n\ndues \n\nfees \n\nlicense \n\nmemberships \n\nuniversity funds \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"This policy sets forth the requirements for using University fundsUniversity fundsAll funds appropriated, generated, awarded, donated or otherwise received by the University regardless of their source.

Introduction\n\nC.R.S. \u00a7 23-7-110 requires an institution of higher education in Colorado to classify a student as an in-state student for tuition purposes if a student, other than a nonimmigrant alien:\n\nAttends a public or private high school in Colorado for at least 3 years immediately preceding graduation or completion of a general equivalency diploma (GED) in Colorado; and\nIs admitted to a Colorado institution or attends an institution under a reciprocity agreement within twelve months after graduation or completion of a general equivalency diploma (GED) in Colorado.\n\nIn addition to the above requirements, a student seeking in-state tuition status, who does not have lawful immigration status must submit an affidavit stating that the student has applied for lawful presence or will apply as soon as he or she is able to do so.\n\nSuch student shall not be counted as a resident student for any other purpose than tuition classification, but the student is eligible for the college opportunity fund stipend pursuant to the provisions of that program, upon confirmation of the student\u2019s uniquely identifying student number provided by the local education provider where the student graduated high school or received their GED.\nSuch student may be eligible for institutional or other private financial aid programs.\nThe affidavit shall be treated as an education record of the student under the provisions of the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232g.\n\nThe bill creates an exception to the requirement of admission to an institution within 12 months after graduating or completing a GED for certain students who either graduated or completed a GED prior to September 1, 2013 and who have been continuously present in Colorado for at least 18 months prior to enrolling in an institution.\nAny information provided by the student to satisfy the eligibility criteria shall be confidential, unless disclosure is explicitly required by law.\nThe bill exempts persons receiving educational services or benefits from institutions of higher education from providing any required documentation of lawful presence in the United States.\nII. Policy Statement\n\nCampuses shall follow the specific provisions related to in-state classification at institutions of higher education for students who complete high school in Colorado per C.R.S. \u00a7 23-7-110.\nIII.

Additionally, the Board of Regents passed a resolution in February 2012 authorizing the campus chancellors to implement a pilot program pursuant to HB 09-1039 to offer in-state tuition status to students who are dependents of honorably discharged members of the armed forces who have resided in Colorado for any period of time prior to enrollment, who can otherwise establish domicile in Colorado, and who have previously attended at least two years of high school in Colorado."},{"university":"cu","name":"1008","policy":"\n\nAPS 1008 -

The process shall require a program plan that describes the purpose and proposed administrative and fiscal structure of the organization.\n\t\t\u00a0\nAn assessment of potential university liabilities by the campus legal counsel must accompany the request for approval.\n\t\t\u00a0\nThe Board of Regents shall be informed when a new institute is approved.\n\nInstitute Name Changes\n\t\nInstitute name changes shall be approved by the chancellor.\n\nInstitute Closure\n\t\nThe campus chancellor shall have the authority to approve the closure of an institute.

Institute Operations\n\n\nFaculty at various ranks (including adjoint faculty and other special faculty such as research associates) may participate in the activities of institutes in accordance with the by-laws of the organization. Regular tenure-track faculty members hold their appointment in their primary unit. In accordance with regent policy, non-tenure-track faculty (specialty track, adjoint, adjunct, research faculty, etc.) are on limited or indeterminate appointments based upon available funding and satisfactory performance.\n\t\u00a0\nWritten documentation of the fiscal control provisions (i.e., accounting procedures, use of general funds, terms and conditions of expenditure and authorization, agreements for indirect cost recovery, etc.) shall be required for each institute.\n\t\u00a0\nThe chancellor approves any appointment of directors and other chief administrative officers of institutes.\n\nIV. Definitions\n\nINSTITUTES - An institute is defined as a single or multi-disciplinary unit that is organized for the primary purpose of research and creative work. The mentoring of students within the research and creative work is an important goal of institutes. Likewise, providing public and professional leadership and service related to the fields of the institute is expected. Institutes are characterized by organizational permanency, programmatic autonomy, a broad program of study, and an annual operating budget that is fiscally independent of other academic units. They are expected to have substantial external funding (typically over $1 million\/year), commitments for associated faculty lines, evidence of long-term sustainability, a program of research training, and substantial infrastructure. Faculty and research\/teaching staff in institutes usually participate in interdisciplinary graduate\/undergraduate education programs. Institutes report to the campus chief academic officer or their designee and go through rigorous program review similar to that for academic departments.\n\nV.

Related Policies, Procedures, Forms, Guidelines and Other Resources\n\n\nProcedures\n\t\nCriminal history information shall be collected on applications for admissions. A campus or school or college policy may also authorize the campus or school or college to collect information about pending criminal charges, so long as the policy explains how such information may be evaluated and provides the applicant an opportunity to supplement the application, for example, if the charges are dropped or if the applicant is acquitted.\nIf an applicant indicates that he\/she has been convicted of a crime, or is subject to pending criminal charges if those are covered by campus policy, the application will be reviewed on an individual basis. The applicant shall be permitted to provide an explanatory statement regarding the criminal conviction or charge.\nThe campus or school\/college admissions procedures shall clearly specify how criminal history is evaluated, including:\n\t\t\ndesignating an administrator or committee responsible for reviewing the criminal history information; and\ndescribing when in the application process that review will occur.\n\nThe campus or school\/college admissions procedures shall specify which factors may be considered in determining how criminal history affects an admissions decision. \u00a0At a minimum, such procedures should require consideration of the following factors:\u200b\n\t\t\nNumber of criminal convictions;\nNature and severity of the offense(s);\nLength of time since arrest and conviction;\nWhether the crime involved violence against persons or property;\nTerms or conditions of any plea, penalty, punishment, sentence, probation, or parole, and the applicant\u2019s compliance with those terms;\nAny mitigating information provided by the applicant, and any information provided by the applicant about his\/her activities since the conviction; and\nThe applicant\u2019s ability to comply with any program requirements for clinical rotations, externships, or similar external placements, if this can be determined in advance.\n\nAdmission may be conditioned on reasonable requirements as to conduct or performance.\u200b\nThe applicant will be notified in writing of the admission decision.\n\nEach campus shall submit its campus or school\/college admissions procedures to the Office of Policy and Efficiency not later than six months after the effective date of this APS.

The university is committed to the guiding principles of openness, transparency, accountability and responsiveness.\u00a0\n\nRequirements for requesting to inspect public records for the University of Colorado.\n\t\nAll requests to inspect public records must be submitted in writing to the official custodian of the relevant campus or of system administration\/Board of Regents designated in Appendix B. \u00a0Requests made to any person other than the proper custodian will not be accepted.\nRequests may be mailed or sent via facsimile. The date the request is received by the custodian will constitute the \u201cdate of receipt\u201d. \u00a0Requests made via electronic mail will not automatically be accepted.\u00a0The\u00a0custodian,\u00a0at the custodian\u2019s sole prerogative,\u00a0may accept requests sent via e-mail upon request.\u00a0 Should the custodian accept an email request, the statutory time for response will begin when the custodian provides confirmation to requestor. \u00a0If a request is sent via e-mail to anyone other than the custodian, it will not be considered as received by the university\nAll requests for records\u00a0must\u00a0be specific as to the records sought and the relevant dates. Requests for correspondence must identify the parties to the correspondence. For any request that is vague or broadly stated the custodian may require the requestor to provide a more specific request.\nIf a requestor is unable to identify the specific document(s) sought, the requestor is encouraged to contact the relevant custodian in advance of submitting a request for assistance in providing the requisite specificity.\nThere are several categories of information that are protected by State and Federal law.\u00a0 See \u00a0Appendix A\u00a0for a list of examples of information that the university is prohibited from releasing.\u00a0\nThe university is not required by the Act to construct or create a record that does not exist.\u00a0 Nor is the university required to manipulate or analyze information in a new way in order to respond to a request. \u00a0\u00a0\nTime for response to records requests shall be as follows:\n\t\t\nThe normal time for production shall be three (3) working days; beginning on the first business day after the request is received.\nSuch period may be extended upon determination by the custodian that extenuating circumstances exist. Such period of extension shall not normally exceed\u00a0seven (7)\u00a0working days. The requestor shall be notified of the extension within the three-day period.\n\nRequests to inspect records will not take priority over the regular work activities of university employees.\nCharges for copies of requested records shall be as follows:\n\t\t\nThe normal cost for requested documents shall be $.25 per page or, for documents in non-standard formats, the actual duplication costs.\nAt the custodian\u2019s prerogative, the custodian may charge a research and retrieval fee based on the actual cost of responding to the request; provided, however, that the hourly rate for employee time is thirty dollars per hour and there shall be no charge for the first hour of employee time.\u00a0 If the custodian charges research and retrieval fees under this paragraph, copying shall be charged at a rate of $.15 per page.\u00a0\nPayment must be received prior to the requestor receiving copies.\n\nIf charges are expected to exceed $25, the custodian will provide the requestor with an estimate of the cost of responding prior to responding and may require a deposit. If the requestor wishes to proceed once receiving an estimate, he or she must respond in writing. By responding in writing, the requestor agrees to pay all fees associated with responding to the request. The time between the date of the custodian\u2019s estimate and the receipt by the custodian of a written response to proceed will not be counted against the time period set forth above.\nIf a requestor wishes to inspect available records in advance of receiving copies, such inspection shall be by appointment only during normal working hours. Such inspection must be supervised by a university representative and the requestor may be charged for any employee time exceeding one hour associated with such inspection.\n\n\nIII. \u00a0Related Policies, Procedures, Forms, Guidelines and Other Resources\n\n\nProcedures\nProcedures for Requesting Access to Public Records at the University of Colorado\n\t\u00a0\nForms\nPublic Records Request Form\n\t\u00a0\nOther Resources (i.e. training, secondary contact information)\nAppendix A:\u00a0Information Not Public by Law\nAppendix B:\u00a0Procedure to Submit a Formal Request\n\nIV. \u00a0History\n\n\nNew policy established 7\/1\/13\nRevised July 1, 2014\n\nV. \u00a0Key Words\n\nColorado, open, records, act, CORA, inspection, public, records, custody, control, official, custodian, 24-72-201, retention, access, informal, formal, request, documents, copies, fees, costs, retrieval, reporters, media\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\n24-72-201 \n\naccess \n\nColordo \n\ncopies \n\nCORA \n\ncosts \n\ncustodian \n\ncustody \n\ndocuments \n\nfees \n\ninformal \n\ninspection \n\nmedia \n\nofficial \n\nopen \n\npublic \n\nrecords \n\nrecords act \n\nreporters \n\nrequests \n\nretention \n\nretrieval \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"Pursuant to C.R.S. \u00a7 24-72-201\u00a0et seq., the \u201cColorado Open Records Act\u201d (the Act\u201d), all public records must be open for inspection by any person at reasonable times, except as provided by law.

Policy Statement\n\nThe University of Colorado allows the use of alternate work arrangements. There are many possible mechanisms available to modify work arrangements; however not every job is well-suited for each of these options. The decision to implement an alternate work arrangement is at the discretion of the classified staff appointing authority or university staff department head. Once the decision to provide an alternate work arrangement is made, the terms must be discussed and documented between the supervisor and employeeEmployeesAn individual who currently holds a University employment appointment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal or hourly..\nEach campus may develop guidelines on alternate work arrangements based on the needs of their employee community. Alternate work arrangements may include, but are not limited to: flex schedules, compressed work weeks, flexplaces, and job sharingDefinitionsSee Section III. Definitions.\nEmployee understands that some information used in his\/her work may be deemed confidential by the University and shall apply all University-required security safeguards and policies at the same level as in the regular office in order to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, loss or damage.\nIII. \u00a0Definitions\n\n\nRegular flex schedule - employee works the same set of hours each day but it varies from the regular core business hours of the office. (example: Monday through Friday from 6:00 am \u2013 3:00 pm)\n\t\u00a0\nDaily flex schedule - employee is allowed to set his or her own work hours within the parameters set by management. (example: Must work 8 hours Monday through Friday anytime between 7:30 am \u2013 5:30 pm and can vary day to day)\n\t\u00a0\nCompressed work week - a full work week is completed in fewer than five days by increasing the number of hours worked per day. (example: Monday through Thursday from 6:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm)\n\t\u00a0\n9\/80 work week - four days are worked in one week and five days are worked in the next week for a total of 80 hours. The arrangements may require re-defining the employee\u2019s workweek for those eligible for overtime.\n\t\u00a0\nFlexplace - employees are allowed to work from home or another \u201cremote work location\u201d to complete work duties as necessary.\n\t\u00a0\nJob sharing - two employees share the duties of one full-time position and received prorated salaries based on the percent of time assigned.\n\nIV. \u00a0Related Policies, Procedures, Forms, Guidelines and Other Resources\n\n\nForms\n\n\tCU Denver - Flexplace Participation Agreement\n\t\u00a0\nGuidelines\n\n\tCU Boulder - Alternate Schedule Guidelines\n\tCU Colorado Springs - Policy 300-004 Alternate Work Schedules Locations\n\t\u00a0\nDPA Technical Guidance\n\nFlextime\n\nFlexplace\n\nJob Sharing\n\t\u00a0\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSystem Employees\n\nV.

A sabbatical assignment is an important tool in developing academic scholarship and is a time for concentrated professional development. It is expected that the faculty member shall use the sabbatical assignment in a manner that shall enhance his\/her scholarly and\/or teaching competence and potential for leadership and service to the university, as well as to advance the primary unit's program goals.\n\t\u00a0\nAfter six years of service to the university on full-time appointment, a tenured member of the faculty shall become eligible for a sabbatical assignment. In the case of the Anschutz Medical Campus faculty, tenure-eligible and specialty-track faculty members who have attained the rank of associate or full professor are also eligible for sabbatical assignments after six years of full-time service to the university.\n\t\u00a0\nA tenured faculty member on an appointment of 50-99% is also eligible for a sabbatical after six years of service, but at a proportional rate of pay (based on the average percentage of FTE appointment over the last six years). In the School of Medicine, faculty members on less than 100% appointments may have the interval between sabbaticals adjusted, rather than the salary.\n\nIII. \u00a0Specific Rules and Procedures Regarding The Award of Sabbaticals\n\n\nEligibility. Tenured faculty, and other faculty members specified in Regent Law 5.B.3.C, are eligible to apply for a sabbatical after six years of service to the university. \u00a0Eligible faculty members may apply for subsequent sabbaticals after at least six years of additional service to the university, must have filed a report on sabbatical activity (described below), and must demonstrate that he\/she has substantially met the academic goals stated in the previous sabbatical plan.\n\t\u00a0\nAdministrative Time. University administrators are not eligible for sabbaticals. (University policy defines department chairs as faculty, not administrators.) Tenured faculty members who also hold full time administrative positions may only take a sabbatical from their faculty positions after completely relinquishing their administrative position. They may apply for sabbaticals upon return to their faculty positions. Time in administrative appointments counts toward eligibility for faculty sabbaticals.\n\t\u00a0\nCalculating Years of Service. In calculating service years for the purpose of sabbatical eligibility, periods of time when a faculty member took an unpaid leave of absence may count, depending on the circumstances and subject to approval by the provost.\n\t\u00a0\nApproval Process. Eligible faculty members seeking approval for a sabbatical shall submit a plan for the sabbatical. The plan shall include the following information: (1) dates of sabbatical; (2) plan for coverage of current academic responsibilities and replacement of teaching expenses; (3) plan for coverage of all other current responsibilities (any responsibilities to be retained while on leave must be documented and agreed to by supervisor and others as appropriate; these may include administrative responsibilities, research grants and\/or clinical service); (4) remuneration plan for sabbatical (includes source of funds, identification of expenses to be reimbursed and manner in which reimbursement is to occur); (5) statement of available external funding sources and attempts to obtain such funding; (6) description of the sabbatical\u2019s academic objectives, including its contribution to the faculty member\u2019s professional growth and expertise; (7) description of a clear work plan, including all anticipated professional activities; (8) demonstration of the benefit of the proposal\u2019s objectives to the academic, clinical, and\/or pedagogical goals of the primary unit; (9) specification of the sabbatical\u2019s contribution to enhancing the university\u2019s reputation; and (10) \u00a0description of the sabbatical\u2019s contribution to the educational experience of the students. Each plan shall be subject to approval by the department chair, unit head, or an appropriate primary unit committee; by the dean of the college\/school; and by the provost. If approved, the faculty member's request shall be forwarded to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who shall ensure that each step of the approval process has met the requirements of this policy. Requests shall then be forwarded to the Board of Regents for final approval.\n\t\u00a0\nSabbatical Salary Support. The dean of the school\/college shall ensure that the costs associated with the sabbatical are covered, including teaching replacement expenses. \u00a0The dean may suspend a sabbatical if funding is not available in the school\/college. Remuneration (from university resources such as state funding, university administered grants or contracts, or any other university managed sources) for the sabbatical assignment shall be as follows: for full-time faculty on nine-month appointments, either full salary for one semester or half salary for two semesters; for full-time faculty on 12-month appointments, six months full salary or half salary for sabbaticals of 6 to 12 months duration. Stipends for administrative duties, such as chair or center director stipends, are not included in \"salary\" and shall not be taken into account in calculating the individual's salary while on sabbatical.\n\n\tFor nine-month faculty members on 50-99% appointments, remuneration shall be pro-rated. For example, a faculty member on a 75% appointment would receive that usual 75% salary for one semester or half of that salary per semester for both semesters. For 12-month faculty on 50-99% appointments, remuneration shall also be pro-rated. For example, a faculty member with a 75% appointment would receive his\/her monthly 75% rate salary for up to six months of sabbatical leave. Faculty on leave for 6 to 12 months shall receive half of their usual salary for the term of the sabbatical. For eligible part-time faculty at the Anschutz Medical Campus, the period of the sabbatical may be pro-rated. All information concerning institutional expenses in support of the sabbatical program shall be considered a matter of public record.\n\t\u00a0\nExternal Funding. Faculty members applying for sabbatical assignments shall apply for external funding (such as fellowships, grants, or clinical work) when appropriate. The total university salary to the faculty member, from sabbatical pay and any contract or grant administered through the university, shall not exceed university limits. There is no restriction on additional non-university income, subject to the faculty member satisfying the duties of the sabbatical plan and any contract\/grant requirements.\n\t\u00a0\nUniversity Duties while on Sabbatical. Normally, the university does not hire its faculty who are on sabbatical to teach courses. Any requested exceptions to this provision or other requirements of this policy shall be subject to review and approval by the dean and the provost.\n\t\u00a0\nChanges to Sabbatical Plan. \u00a0If a faculty member on sabbatical assignment finds it necessary or desirable to alter substantially the work plan or academic objectives of the sabbatical project, he\/she shall inform the department chair or dean (as determined by college\/school policy) in writing as soon as possible of the reasons for the proposed change and secure the department chair's or dean's written approval for the revised plan. Any change in the time frame of the sabbatical shall be sent to the dean and provost for approval.\n\t\u00a0\nReturn from Sabbatical. In accepting a sabbatical assignment, the faculty member shall agree to return to the university upon completion of the sabbatical and work for the university for at least two semesters for 9-month faculty and one year for 12-month faculty. Under circumstances in which the faculty member voluntarily terminates his\/her connection with the university within the period of one year after the end of the sabbatical, the individual shall refund the university the amount of the sabbatical salary support provided by the university on a pro-rated basis, this requirement shall be exempted under extraordinary circumstances, such as permanent disability or death of the faculty member, wherein neither the individual nor the heirs shall be obligated to refund any part of the amount paid while the faculty member was on sabbatical. Any exceptions, such as for individual retirement agreements, shall require approval by the dean and the chancellor or chancellor's designee.\n\t\u00a0\nSabbatical Reports. By no later than the end of the first semester after returning to regular duties, the faculty member shall file a substantive report with his\/her dean describing her\/his work and overall accomplishments during the sabbatical. The dean shall evaluate the report for conformity with the sabbatical plan. Both the plan for the sabbatical and the post-sabbatical report shall be public documents. Therefore, no proprietary information reflecting intellectual property issues should be included in these documents. Copies of the plan and the report shall be kept on file by the appropriate dean. The primary unit shall evaluate the sabbatical report as part of the annual merit evaluation and post-tenure review process.\n\t\u00a0\nMultiple Sabbaticals in a Unit. In the event that two or more members of a primary unit simultaneously become eligible for sabbatical assignments and it becomes necessary to limit the number of sabbaticals in the unit, the selection shall be based upon the quality of the sabbatical plan, its immediate relevance to unit goals, and the length of time since the applicant\u2019s last sabbatical. Primary units may add additional criteria at their discretion. The provost shall have the power to resolve special problems of eligibility.\n\t\u00a0\nSabbatical Data. Deans shall maintain annual records of the number of sabbatical requests awarded and the number refused. Chancellors shall submit a summary report on all sabbaticals to the Board of Regents annually.\n\nIV. \u00a0Guidelines for the Evolution of Sabbatical Proposals that Coincide with \u00a0Major Change in Duties\n\n\nAs described in HB 94-1050, the intent of sabbaticals is to maintain a high caliber of faculty by developing and enhancing faculty expertise in teaching and research. Thus, a sabbatical is not primarily a reward for past performance, but a tool for faculty development. The criteria that the university has created for evaluating sabbatical proposals emphasize this faculty development intent.\n\n\tThe criteria for sabbaticals are clear for faculty members whose careers lie in a particular discipline and whose responsibilities remain fairly constant over time. For those individuals, the reviewing authority can examine the quality of the sabbatical plan and the faculty member's track record to determine the merits of the proposed sabbatical program and its potential contribution to the institution.\n\n\tBy contrast, in the case of a sabbatical request from faculty members undergoing a significant shift in duties, such as an assigned change in the relative emphasis on teaching and research duties or a change in management responsibilities, the reviewing authority may need to take these changes into account. The criteria below are intended to assist the reviewing authority in evaluating such sabbatical proposals.\n\t\u00a0\n\t\nAdditional Criteria for Sabbaticals Approved at a Time of Significant Shift in Duties.\n\n\t\tFaculty members applying for a sabbatical at or near a time of major change in responsibilities must meet all the established requirements of eligibility, including submission of sabbatical plans. In addition, the plans should contain: (1) descriptions of the changes in duties and expectations created by the faculty member's reassignments; and (2) explicit discussion of how proposed sabbatical activities shall enhance the faculty member's abilities to carry out these changed responsibilities for the benefit of their units and the university.\n\n\nV. \u00a0History\n\n\nInitial policy effective April 1, 2008\nPolicy revised July 20, 2012.\nThe term \u201cservice\u201d was replaced with the term \u201cleadership and service\u201d effective April 30, 2014 per resolution of the CU Board of Regents.\nRevised July 11, 2016\n\nVI. \u00a0Key Words\n\nSabbatical, faculty, tenure, remuneration, assignments, academic, professional development, scholar, leadership and service\n\n\nTags:\n\n\n\nacademic \n\nassignments \n\nfaculty \n\nleadership and service \n\nprofessional development \n\nremuneration \n\nsabbatical \n\nscholar \n\ntenure \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Policy and Efficiency (OPE)\n\n\n\n\n 1800 Grant, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203 tel: 303-860-5711 | ope@cu.edu\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the CU System?\nCU Boulder\nCU Colorado Springs\nCU Denver\nCU Anschutz Medical Campus\n\n\n\n\nCU Careers \nCU Connections Newsletter\nEmployee Services (HR, Benefits, Payroll)\nProcurement Service Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCU News and Information\nMedia Contacts\nNews Releases\nOpen Records Requests\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nCU For Colorado Outreach\nCU Facts and Figures\nAccountability Data Center\nCU Advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1800 Grant Street, Suite 800 | Denver, CO 80203General: (303) 860-5600 | Fax: (303) 860-5610 | Media: (303) 860-5626\u00a9 Regents of the University of Colorado | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | \n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","summary":"This administrative policy statement provides procedures for implementing\u00a0Regent Law 5.B.3.C\u00a0and\u00a0Regent Policy 5.A. \"Approval of Sabbatical Assignments.\" Administrators responsible for the award of sabbaticals shall be accountable for ensuring compliance with the Regent Laws and Policy on sabbaticals as well as this administrative policy statement."}]
